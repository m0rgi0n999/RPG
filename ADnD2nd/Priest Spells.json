This causes the natural (body) weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creature to recoil if such attacks require touching the protected creature. Animals or monsters summoned or conjured by spells or similar magic are likewise hedged from the character. This protection ends if the protected character makes a melee attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. To complete this spell, the priest uses holy water or burning incense.</p><p>This spell can be reversed to become protection from good: the second and third benefits remain unchanged.</p><p>The material components for the reverse are a circle of unholy water or smoldering dung.</p>",

During the second and sixth (next to the last) rounds, heat causes blisters and damage; in the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal becomes searing hot, causing damage to exposed flesh, as shown below:</p><br/><table><thead><tr><th>Metal Temperature</th><th>Damage per Round</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>very warm</td><td>none</td></tr><tr><td>hot</td><td>1d4 points</td></tr><tr><td>searing*</td><td>2d4 points</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><p>(*) On the final round of searing, the afflicted creature must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell or suffer one of the following disabilities: hand or foot—unusable for 2d4 days, body—disabled 1d4 days, head—unconscious 1d4 turns. This effect can be completely removed by the 5th-level priest heal spell or by normal rest.</p><p>Note also that materials such as wood, leather, or flammable cloth smolder and bum if exposed to searing hot metal. Such materials cause searing damage to exposed flesh on the next round. Fire resistance (spell, potion, or ring) or a protection from fire spell totally negates the effects of a heat metal spell, as does immersion in water or snow, or exposure to a co/d or ice storm spell. This version of the spell does not function underwater. For every two experience levels of the caster, the metal of one man-sized creature can be affected (i.e., arms and armor, or a single mass of metal equal to 50 pounds weight). Thus, a 3rd-level caster would affect one such creature, a 4th- or 5th-level caster two. etc.</p><p>The reverse of the spell, chill metal, counters a heat metal spell or else causes metal to act as follows:</p><br/><table><thead><tr><th>Metal Temperature</th><th>Damage per Round</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>cold</td><td>none</td></tr><tr><td>icy</td><td>1-2 hit points</td></tr><tr><td>freezing*</td><td>1d4  hit points</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><p>(*) On the final round of freezing, the afflicted creature must roll a successful saving throw vs, spell or suffer from the numbing effects of the cold. This causes the loss of all feeling in a hand (or hands, if the DM rules the saving throw was failed badly) for 1d4 days. During this time, the characters grip is extremely weak and he cannot use that hand for fighting or any other activity requiring a firm grasp.</p><p>The chi!/ metal1 spell is countered by a resist cold spell, or by any great heat— proximity to a blazing fire (not a mere torch), a magical flaming sword, a wall of fire spell, etc. Underwater, this version of the spell inflicts no damage, but ice immediately forms around the affected metal, exerting an upward buoyancy.</p>",

Thus, a 4th-Sevel caster calls down a 6d6 bolt (2d8 +4d8).</p><p>The bolt of lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke at whatever distance the spellcaster decides, up to 360 yards away. Any creature within a 10-foot radius of the path or the point where the lightning strikes suffers full damage unless a successful saving throw vs. spell is rolled, in which case only one-half damage is taken.</p><p>Because it requires a storm overhead, this spell can only be used outdoors. It does not function under ground or under water.</p>",

Only one type of insect can be altered at one time (i.e., a single casting cannot affect both an ant and a fly) and all insects affected must be grown to the same size.

Flying insects of 3 Hit Dice or more can carry a rider of human size (assume that such can carry 80 pounds per Hit Die).</p><p>If the casting is interrupted for any reason, or if the insects are currently subject to any other magical effect (including this one), the insects die and the spell b ruined. The DM decides how many normal insects of what type are available: this is often a greater limitation on the spell than the limits above.</p><p>If the insect created by this spell matches an existing monster description, use the monster description. Otherwise, unless the DM creates a special description, the giant form has an Armor Class of between 8 and 4, one attack, and inflicts 1d4 points of damage per Hit Die.</p><p>Example: A 14th-level priest uses the giant insect spell to enlarge one beetle (all that is available) to 6 HD size. The DM decides the beetle has AC 5 and bites once for 6d4 points of damage.</p><p>Note that the spell works only on actual insects. Arachnids, crustaceans, and other types of small creatures are not affected. Any giant insects created by this spell do not attempt to harm the priest, but the priest's control of such creatures is limited to simple commands (\"\"attack,\"\" \"\"defend,\"\" \"\"guard,\"\" and so forth). Orders to attack a certain creature when it appears or guard against a particular occurrence are too complex. Unless commanded to do otherwise, the giant insects attempt to attack whoever or whatever is near them.</p><p>The reverse of the spell, shrink insect, reduces any giant insect to normal insect size. The number of Hit Dice affected by the priest is subtracted from the number of Hit Dice of the insects, and any insect reduced to 0 Hit Dice has been shrunk. Partial shrinking is ignored: an insect is either shrunk or unaffected. Thus, a 9th-level priest attacked by giant ants could shrink three warrior ants or four worker ants to normal insect size with no saving throw. This spell has no effect on intelligent insect-like creatures.</p><p>The priest must use his holy symbol for either version of the spell.</p>",

The animated object, or objects, then attacks whomever or whatever the priest first designates. The animated object can be of any nonmagical material whatsoever—wood, metal, stone, fabric, leather, ceramic, glass, etc. Attempting to animate an object in someone's possession grants that person a saving throw to prevent the spell's effect. The speed of movement of the object depends on its means of propulsion and its weight. A large wooden table would be rather heavy, but its legs would give it speed A rug could only slither along. A jar would roll, Thus a large stone pedestal would rock forward at 10 feet per round, a stone statue would move at 40 feet per round, a wooden statue 80 feet per round, an ivory stool of light weight would move at 120 feet per round. Slithering movement is about 10 feet to 20 feet per round; rolling is 30 feet to 60 feet per round. The damage caused by the attack of an animated object depends on its form and composition. Light, supple objects can only obscure vision, obstruct movement, bind, trip, smother, etc. Light, hard objects can fall upon or otherwise strike for 1d2 points of damage or possibly obstruct and trip, as do tight, supple objects. Hard, medium-weight objects can crush or strike for 2d4 points of damage, while larger and heavier objects may inflict 3d4, 4d4, or even 5d4 points of damage.</p><p>The frequency of attack of animated objects depends on their method of locomotion, appendages, and method of attack. This varies from as seldom as once every five melee rounds to as frequently as once per round. The Armor Class of the object animated is basically a function of material and movement ability. Damage depends on the type of weapon and the object struck. A sharp cutting weapon is effective against fabric, leather, wood, and like substances. Heavy smashing and crushing weapons are useful against wood, stone, and metal objects. Your DM will determine all of these factors, as well as bow much damage the animated object can sustain before being destroyed. The priest can animate one cubic foot of material for each experience level he has attained. Thus, a 14th-level priest could animate one or more objects whose solid volume did not exceed 14 cubic feet—a large statue, two rugs, three chairs, or a dozen average crocks.</p>",

The spell cannot bring back a creature that has reached its allotted life span (i.e., died of natural causes). Casting this spell makes it impossible for the priest to cast further spells or engage in combat until he has had one day of bed rest for each experience level or Hit Die of the creature brought back to life. The caster ages three years upon casting this spell.</p><p>The reverse, destruction, causes the victim of the spell to be instantly dead and turned to dust, A wish spell or equivalent is required for recovery, Destruction requires a touch, either in combat or otherwise, and does not age the caster. In addition, the victim is allowed a saving throw (with a ~4 penalty). If the save is successful, the victim receives Bd6 points of damage instead.</p><p>The material components of the spell are the priest's religious symbol and holy water (unholy water for the reverse spell). The DM may reduce the chances of successful resurrection if little of the creature's remains are available.</p>",

  "description": "<p>By casting this spell, the priest creates a powerful magic in some specially prepared object—a string of prayer beads, a small day tablet, an ivory baton, etc. This object radiates magic, for it contains the power to instantaneously transport its possessor to the sanctuary of the priest who created its magic. Once the item is enchanted, the priest must give it willingly to an individual, at the same time informing him of a command word to be spoken when the item is to be used. To make use of the item, the recipient must speak the command word at the same time that he rends or breaks the item. When this is done, the individual and all that he is wearing and carrying (up to the maximum encumbrance limit for the character) are instantly transported to the sanctuary of the priest, just as if the individual were capable of speaking a word of recall spell. No other creatures can be affected.</p><p>The reversed application of the spell causes the priest to be transported to the immediate vicinity of the possessor of the item when it is broken and the command word said. The priest has a general idea of the location and situation of the item's possessor, and can choose not to be affected by this summons. This decision is made at the instant when the transportation is to take place, but if he chooses not to go, then the opportunity is gone forever and the spell is wasted.</p><p>The cost of preparing the special item (for either version of the spell) varies from 2,000 to 5,000 gp. The more costly items can transport the subject from one plane of existence to another, if the DM allows. Note that the same factors that can prevent the operation of the plane shift and teleport spells can also prevent the use of this spell.</p>",
