== Introduction ==

When the DUNGEONS & Dracons* Game first appeared in 1974, no one was sure how the public would receive it. Nothing could prepare the fledgling Tactical Studies Rules for the stir that D&D* created in the hearts and minds of millions of fantasy lovers all over the world. Twenty years later, fantasy role-playing, the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRaGons® and the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS games are better than ever, and there is no end in sight.

The uniqueness of these two game systems lies in the fact that they are open-ended. The game constantly changes and continually expands with new monsters, extra spells for spellcasters, supplementary proficiencies, and supernumerary magical items—there is nothing that can’t be added to the AD&D®* game system.

Throughout the 20-year history of the D&D and AD&D game worlds, reams of paper and gallons of ink have detailed thousands of magical items. From the original D&D boxed set and the first issue of THE STRATEGIC REVIEW Magazine, to the last products shipped in December 1993, almost every product has featured at least one new magical item, and you will find them all in the ENCYCLOPEDIA MAGICA™ collection. Since many of these products are long out of print, it is impossible for the majority of players and Dungeon Masters around the world to enjoy these unique treasures. We had to call a halt at some point, so these volumes only include those products shipped through December 1993.

Besides the magical items from game products, we have included those from Dragon® Magazine, up to #200; DunGEon* Magazine, issues 1 through 45; all 30 issues of IMAGINE Magazine; PoLYHEDRON*® Newszines through 90, and all seven issues of THE STRATEGIC REVIEW.

In 1992 and 1993, TSR produced a two-volume set, The Magical Encyclopedia, The older encyclopedia is an index of magical items and where these PC trophies can be found among the myriad TSR products. Unfortunately, most of those older products are unavailable—many are now collectors’ items.

We decided to do something about that. The ENCYCLOPEDIA MAGICA volumes feature every magical item we could find, in every product we have ever created. From obscure references to

special weapons in the first modules to the detailed weapons of the DUNGEON MASTER® Guide (DMG), players and DMs alike will have years of enjoyment discovering the thousands of items enchanted by the wonderful power of magic.

DMs are forewarned though, just because an item is listed here does not mean it should be given to players casually. Many items are artifacts (often believed to be items of extreme power), relics (items of historic or sacred value), or items of such potency they can destroy a continuing campaign. Be very careful when releasing these items to your players.

With the enormous number of magical items woven into game systems, it is difficult to overcome the attitude that magic is everywhere and easy to obtain. Given the amount of time, energy, and self-sacrifice required to produce even a dagger +1, finding a single magical item should be a marvelous event in the lives of your characters. (See the Book of Artifacts for information on magical item creation.)

It is not surprising then that the earliest magical items (especially weapons) were given names. From Bucknard'’s everfull purse to the Equalizer (an extremely lethal sword), rare items were named for the individuals who created them or who first used them heroically. However they came by their titles, they now belong to the realm of legend.

Players should be encouraged by the DM to name the items they possess, or the DM should name them before granting them to a player. After all, finding Prismal’s wand of lightning with 10 charges remaining is much more exciting than stumbling over a generic wand of lightning with 10 charges, especially when the players learn that Prismal’s wand overwhelmed the chateau of a renowned and virtuous noble. Players will enjoy items of historical significance more than mundane ones, and a note of realism will be added to your campaign. Remember too, that items themselves can become characters.

ALWAYS AN ADVENTURE!™ is the basic premise for every product produced by TSR, and this encyclopedia is no exception. The ENCYCLOPEDIA MasIca collection is designed to be a useful and enjoyable addition to any role-player’s library, one that will stimulate years of adventure.

=== How to Use These Books ===

The last volume of this encyclopedia contains tables that randomly determine which magical items are found in a treasure hoard, though artifacts and most relics are excluded from the tables. (For those players and DMs who prefer to play a tongue-in-cheek game, we included pun items in the random tables.) We suggest that DMs select the items PCs discover in order to keep garme-busters from appearing at random.

Each item listed in the ENCYCLOPEDIA MAGICA collection marks its type and name, gives the experience point and gold piece values, the source, and a detailed description. To find a particular item, look under its name or use the detailed index supplied in the final volume.

Magical Item Name: Most often, this is the name given to the item in its first (and usually) subsequent appearances. Unfortunately, some names changed. This was done for three reasons. First, we tried to make items more useful, exciting, or easier to find. Second, a few were changed in order to make placement more convenient and logical. Finally, some of the D&D and first edition items had names that were changed in later editions, updates, and product lines. These were brought into line with current usage to prevent confusion.

In many cases, items were grouped together to create order and make it easier to find things. For example, short swords, bastard swords, and all other swords are grouped together under the single entry Sword. This means that a DM looking for information on the sword of dancing doesn’t have to remember if it’s a short sword or a long sword. These entries typically have a random table at the beginning of the entry that allows the Dungeon Master to create a larger repertoire of magical items. (The Sword entry’s random table, for example, includes rapier, bastard sword, gladius, claymore, khopesh, cutlass, ninja-to, among many, many others.)

Experience Point Value: To make use of an item’s experience point value, check the particular set of rules you are using. In the original AD&D game, experience is awarded only for items kept and used on an adventure. This helped to check the idea that killing monsters and NPCs is the only way to gain experience. In the AD&D 2nd Edition game, experience is awarded to the

character who creates an item in order to slow level progression, In the D&D game, experience points are not usually awarded for magical items. However, many Dungeon Masters find it convenient to grant experience points to characters who find and keep items no matter what rules the campaign uses.

In some entries, experience point value is listed as “—”. This indicates a unique and potent item (often called an artifact or relic). Artifacts and relics have powers far beyond what even the most heroic mortal can wield without detrimental effects to his or her health and psyche. Experience is never given for these items, and the DM must carefully monitor their use in a campaign. Generally, it is unwise to introduce any magical item into a game unless the DM understands the item’s powers and how those powers affect play—this is especially true for artifacts and relics.

Gold Piece Value: Throughout the ENCYCLOPEDIA MAGICA volumes, items are given a value, listed in gp. This does not mean that every item can be purchased by simply surrendering the specified coinage. Instead, gp value is used to rate the relative values of different items to each other. In individual campaigns, the Dungeon Master may wish to increase the “bartering value” of items two-fold, ten-fold, or even 100-fold to keep magical items the rare and wonderful things that they are, and it’s a great way to keep the campaign from overbalancing. See the section below on Monetary System Conversions for an extensive table to convert the AD&D gold piece standard to any AD&D campaign world that uses a different standard. Many entries have a gold piece value rated “—”. This means that the item is so priceless that it is impossible to rate its true barter value.

First Appearance or Best Reference: The small type (DRAGON Magazine 2) designates either the first source in which an item appeared, or the title of the most complete reference.

Description/Explanation: This is the descriptive text of an item. Often, the original passage has been altered or expanded to clarify the use of the item or its history. In a few cases, the description is either significantly or completely changed (but this is rare).

Running Magical Item Total: Along the footer of each page is a series of numbers. These enumerate the number of magical items cited up to that page. Each new header for a magical item increases the number of items described in the entry. To find the total magical items detailed in this encyclopedia, look at the final magical item entry in the last volume.

=== Design Notes ===

The items listed in the ENCYCLOPEDIA MAGICA accessory are categorized wherever possible. This may cause some initial confusion until the reader gets used to the format. The summary below should help solve these problems.

Ammunition: There are three basic types of ammunition in the AD&D game: Arrows (including bolts), sling bullets (for sling weapons), and shot (for powder weapons). All ammunition is to be found in one of these three categories.

Armor: All armor (but not shields, helmets, or gauntlets) is placed in a single category. Random selection charts augment the unique nature of these items.

Books: Magical books have been categorized in five different sections: Book, Libram, Manual, Spellbook, and Tome. Books are used exclusively by priests and Jibrams only by wizards. Manuals can be used by any character class and tomes are magical volumes that can be used by thieves or fighters. Spellbooks contain spells for both wizards and priests.

Musical Instruments: Instruments are separated into three basic types: Wind, percussion, and stringed. In general, if you are looking for a harp, guitar, or harpsichord, look under Stringed Instrument. To find bagpipes, flutes, organs, trumpets, and the like, refer to Wind Instrument. To locate drums, rattles, chimes, bells, or other noisemakers, look under Percussion Instrument.

Potions vs. Oils: A great deal of confusion exists about the difference between potions and oils. Potions, philters, and elixirs are things that must be swallowed to gain the magical effect or property they contain. Oils, salves, and ointments are liquids that are rubbed into the flesh or hair, or coated on items to release their magical properties.

Weapons: There are so many different types of weapons (and many of them have but a single magical version), it was necessary to categorize these as well. The 19 sections on weapons in this encyclopedia are: Axe, Bow (including crossbows), Club, Dagger, Dart, Flail Weapon, Hammer, Lance, Mace, Mattock, Polearm, Powder Weapon, Sickle, Sling, Spear, Staff, Sword, Throwing Star, and Whip. (Quarterstaves and similar weapons are included with magical staves.) To find your favorite weapon, please refer to the index. At the top of each weapon category is a random chart that allows the DM to create unique, magical items that exist only in his or her campaign. For instance, in the DUNGEON MASTER Guide, the holy avenger is always a long sword. Using the charts, it is possible to have a holy avenger khopesh, or even a ninja-to; the possibilities are almost endless.

Most items, clothing, block and tackle, cloaks, wands, staves, etc., are to be found in their usual position in the alphabetical listings. Again, if you have problems finding a particular item, please refer to the index in the last volume. The index is your guide to exciting, magic-laden campaigns.

While this game accessory is intended to be used with the AD&D game system, a little tinkering is all that is required to make the items listed here compatible with traditional D&D game campaigns. The DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Rules Cyclopedia, Appendix Two contains rules that will make conversions easy.

=== Navigating the Encyclopedia ===

We tried to make using this encyclopedia as simple and as easy as possible, and we developed our own system of classification. First, all common items, amulets, books, cloaks, daggers, have their own combined entries. This was done to avoid the boredom of reading “Sword of, Sword of, Sword of,” and to make it easier for you to find the items you need quickly. Within the multiple listings you will find a header, Amulet, for example, followed by alphabetical listings of the amulets. These are listed simply as “ofthe Abyss, Against Disease, of Amiability,” and so on. If the object type was preceded by a title or a name, Cartographer’s, for example, it is listed with just the name of the object—we thought “Attacks Upon the Owner, Jewel of” was a bit unwieldy.

When searching for unique items that are not covered by the group entries, look under an item’s name, not under the subject. For example, you will find Queen Ehlissa’s Marvelous Nightingale under Q, listed just that way—znot as “Nightingale, Queen Ehlissa’s Marvelous.”

=== References ===

In a set of volumes that compiles over 20 years worth of material, there is little space leftover. It was not possible to reveal and detail all of the people and places that appear in the text. Entire modules and boxed sets have been dedicated to them—besides, a little mystery about magical items is a good thing. For the truly curious (and for those of you who want to make sure this encyclopedia is complete), we have placed the name of the TSR product in which the item first appeared (or the one with the most details, if there was more than one use) beneath the GP/XP values of each item. You can research the background of the item, or go creative. You might use the information given as a starting point and tell your own tales. The choice is yours.

=== Rules, Stats, and Monsters ===

Twenty years have elapsed since some of these items have appeared. It was necessary, therefore, to convert all game statistics to AD&D 2nd Edition rules. The D&D Rules Cyclopedia has a chapter on conversion, for those of you who need it, and First Edition DMs and players should be well used to tweaking 2nd Edition rules and stats.

Some of the items from earlier products were altered, names of monsters were brought into line with current practices, and the names of the planes were altered to avoid confusion with the new PLANESCAPE™ line—Tarterus, for example, is now Carceri. Some things could not be changed, however. Athena ’ Shield is still Athena’ Shield. Wherever possible, we have tried to keep the flavor and integrity of the earlier works intact while bringing older material into a new and more enjoyable light.

=== Monetary System Conversion ===

Many campaign worlds under the AD&D banner do not use the same gold piece standard. The DRAGONLANCE® campaign world, DARK SUN® adventure setting, and the Oriental Adventures realm (found in the Kara-Tur boxed set and the Oriental Adventures rulebook) are just three examples. Therefore, before an item can be used (purchased, stolen, or traded), you must convert the value of the item into the monetary system of the game world in which your campaign is set.

In a DRAGONLANCE campaign, the gold piece is either devalued by a factor of 10 or has been replaced by the steel piece (stl). To change this into the proper currency, the DM should either convert the prices given here to steel pieces, or simply multiply the gp value by 10 and keep prices in gold. In the Oriental Adventures realm, the gold piece is not even a viable coin. Therefore, assume the characters must pay in Ch’ao or Tael and multiply the value by two.

Please note that the tables on the following page allow easy conversion of the different coinage found throughout TSR’s game worlds.

=== Random Power Tables for Artifacts ===

==== Book of Artifacts ====

Although complete descriptions of the magical powers of many artifacts are given, there are many items that lack detailed explanations. Random tables for determining unlisted powers are presented here. To discover the powers of an artifact, find the appropriate table in this section and either select one appropriate to your campaign, or roll the dice.

The tables provide broad categories to define a wide variety of artifact powers. DMs are urged to select powers from the lists, rather than rely on dice rolls. Blind chance can easily lead to unusual and illogical results, destroying the continuity of an artifact’s nature and history, as well as disrupting your campaign. There are only a few items where a completely random selection is truly appropriate. It works well with the //horn of change//, and possibly even with a device like the //machine of Lum the Mad//. With these items, randomness is a basic property, but randomness is applicable to few others.

In addition to selecting powers, the DM must also decide how the power is applied. A suggested use is given for most powers, but this can hardly account for all possible shapes, forms, and usages. A character can strike an enemy with the //sword of Kas//, but that would be quite a trick with //Heward’s mystical organ//. As a guideline, hand held items (swords, scepters, etc.) should touch the target to activate a power, while those items that are worn are activated by thought or spoken command. The large, immobile items (like the //machine of Lum the Mad//) either have immediate effects on characters or charge them with powers that can be released later. The machine could immediately increase prime requisite ability scores or provide the knowledge needed to cast a //fireball// (for a single use, or even once per day!) into a character’s mind.

Most of the random artifact powers duplicate existing spells and have the same restrictions, Obviously, magical items never require material components. Spells that vary by level should operate as if cast by a 20th-level wizard or priest (within the limitations of the spell), unless otherwise noted. Powers marked in //**italic boldface**// are from spells found in the //Tome of Magic//.

Some random artifact powers are unique. These are described where they appear, but because of the necessity to be brief, not every rule can be covered. DMs are once more encouraged to resolve these as they think best. Individual judgments add to each campaign’s unique flavor. As an aid to designing new artifacts, each table has a brief description of its category.

Two of the tables below—**Table 1-19: Nature** and **Table 1-20: Necromancy**—are not used in this book. They are provided to round out the collection for those DMs who want to design their own artifacts.

The tables cannot include every possible power an artifact might have, In addition to the tables here, there could be others based on any imaginable topic. Those who want more variety should add whatever powers they need, creating new tables when necessary. Nor should anyone consider themselves limited to AD&D game tules. Other genres—horror, science fiction, as well as your own imagination, can provide inspiration for the creation of new and unique magical items. For example, many of the mutations found in the **GAMMA WORLD®** game could become strange and wonderful powers ina bizarre, other-worldly device. In short, have fun, expand, experiment.

**In Ravenloft:** Due to their unusual power and purpose, artifacts and relics may transcend the limitations of Ravenloft. At the DM’s discretion, spells cast from an artifact or relic are unchanged by the demiplane (as are any spell-like abilities). These powerful items may even help characters escape from Ravenloft. An evil artifact may not want to leave, however. Furthermore, any character who owns an evil artifact or relic must make a Ravenloft powers check once a week.

==== Table 1-00: Abjuration ====
Abjuration primarily negates properties and powers. Unlike offensive spells, these powers do not destroy, rather they remove enchantments, bindings, and the like.

^ Roll ^ Power |
| 1 | Cast //abjure// (3/day) |
| 2 | Cast //avoidance// between a creature and the user (1/day) |
| 3 | Cast //banishment// by touch (1/week) |

| 5 | Cast //dismissal// upon any planar creature by touch (1/week) |
| 6 | Cast //dispel evil/dispel good// (1/day) |
| 7 | Cast //dispel magic// by touch (1/day) |

| 19 | Dispel illusions within a 60’ radius (3/day) |
| 20 | Have //turn wood// continually in effect while the artifact is in hand |

==== Table 1-01: Cataclysm ====
Cataclysms cannot be intentionally called upon by an artifact’s owner. They occur at random intervals. While a character might get lucky and trigger an incendiary cloud just as orcs storm the stronghold, the cataclysm takes no sides. Human defenders and orc attackers are equally vulnerable to the artifact’s vengeance—even the artifact’s owner. All of the cataclysms described here affect a minimum area one mile in diameter.

^ Roll ^ Power |
| 1 | Cast //**acid storm**// to rain down upon the area of effect for two full turns |
| 2 | Create a //permanent aura of desolation// that settles over the area of effect. Indviduals of good alignment are haunted by terrifying dreams and suffer -2 penalties to THAC0 and saving throws while evil creatures gain +2 penalties to the same. Plants twist and wither, crops fail, and herds grow sickly. |
| 3 | Blanket the area of effect with a blizzard, dropping temperatures to 0° F and inflicting 1d6 points of damage per hour to those unsheltered. Overland movement is impossible. The storm lasts 1d6+12 hours and snows remain 1d3 days (summer), 2d6 days (spring/fall), or 2d20 days (winter). |
| 4 | Ravage the area of effect with //call lightning// for 72 hours (432 bolts), randomly striking any targets |
| 5 | Create a //cloudkill// spell upon the area of effect for 1d6 hours |
| 6 | Form a ring of //creeping doom// around the area of effect that constricts in a solid blanket inward, not diminishing until the center is reached (4 hours toreach center).
| 7 | Settle a //death fog// over the area of effect that remains in place for 2d20 rounds |
| 8 | Strike the area of effect with a permanent drought. All water present or brought into the area of effect evaporates instantly. |
| 9 | Hit the area of effect with an //earthquake// spell. |
| 10 | Rain a //fire storm// down upon the area of effect for 2d6 rounds |
| 11 | Flood the entire area of effect, destroying buildings and fields. All living creatures unable to fly risk drowning in the rushing waters. The waters recede to safe levels in 1d6 hours but remain for 2d20 days. |
| 12 | Sweep an //incendiary cloud// through the entire area of effect |
| 13 | Settle an //insect plague// upon the area of effect for 1d6 hours that, besides other spell effects, destroys all plants. |
| 14 | Instantly create a permanent magic-dead area of effect. Nonartifact magical items do not function in the zone, spellcasting is impossible, and all existing spells are negated, including permanent enchantments on creatures. Summoned beings are driven back to their own plane. |
| 15 | Create a //meteor swarm// to rain down upon the area of effect for 1d12 hours (8 spheres/round, or 480/hour), randomly striking targets within the area of effect |
| 16 | Create a permanent //**spiral of degeneration**// that settles upon the area of effect. Only artifacts remain unaffected.
| 17 | Create a permanent //**wildzone**// in the area of effect |
| 18 | Transfer the whole area of effect to a randomly chosen lower plane. The artifact is not transported. |
| 19 | Strike the entire area of effect with a //storm of vengeance//. |
| 20 | Create permanent //wolf spirits// to guard the area of effect; they are hostile to all nonanimal life forms.

==== Table 1-02: Combat ====
The powers on this table are associated with weapons and generally give advantages in melee combat.

^ Roll ^ Power |
| 1 | Cause //paralyzation// by touch (3/day) |
| 2 | Provide initiative each combat round |
| 3 | Have //blur// constantly in effect while the artifact is in hand |
| 4 | Cast //**choose future**// (1/day) |
| 5 | Provide double attacks per round |

| 18 | Cast //Tenser’s transformation// upon the user (1/day) |

| 20 | Cast //**warband quest**// (1/month) |

==== Table 1-03: Conjuration ====
The powers here relate to the ability to summon creatures or objects from other places or to create things out of thin air.

^ Roll ^ Power |

| 2 | Cast //**animal horde**// (1/month) |
| 3 | Cast //animal summoning I—III//—the user chooses the creature summoned (1/day) |

| 18 | Cast //trap the soul// upon a creature by touch (1/month) |
| 19 | Cast //unseen servant// to be constantly at hand to serve the user |
| 20 | Cast //weather summoning// (1/week) |

==== Table 1-04: Cursed ====
These powers usually affect only the owner of an artifact. Once a curse triggers, the presence of the artifact is not important, since the effect centers on the character and not on the item. Most curses end when the character voluntarily surrenders the artifact, whether it is given up, lost, or stolen.

^ Roll ^ Power |
| 1 | Instantly pollute all holy water within 30’ of the user |
| 2 | Reduce the user’s Charisma by 1d4 points |

| 4 | Inflict a -2 penalty on the user’s saving throws vs. poison  |
| 5 | Cause the user’s touch to rot away wooden items the size of a bow or less in 1d4 days  |
| 6 | Cause the user’s touch to kill plants (inflicts 1d6 points of damage to plantbased creatures) |
| 7 | Cause NPC reactions to the user to be neutral or worse |
| 8 | Inflict insatiable hunger upon the user, who must eat a full meal once every waking hour |
| 9 | Instantly change the gender of anyone handling an artifact for the first time |
| 10 | Inflict deafness upon the user, who then can only hear when people shout. Spellcasters must shout their spells to be successful. |
| 11 | Inflict an incurable disease upon the user. At the beginning of each month a saving throw vs. death magic must be made to avoid losing 1 point of Constitution. When the user’s Constitution reaches 0, death occurs. |
| 12 | Cause the user’s touch to have a 50% chance of draining the magic from any item not an artifact |
| 13 | Inflict 5d10 points of damage upon anyone handling the artifact for the first time |
| 14 | Cause a 50% chance of the user being struck by a //geas// each time a power of the artifact is used. The //geas// must be completed before the artifact can be used again. |
| 15 | Age the user 1d10 years each time the artifact is used. Although the user suffers all the effects of aging, death by old age is not possible as long as the artifact remains in possession. |
| 16 | Afflict the user with lycanthropy |
| 17 | Cause the user’s touch to be poisonous (saving throw vs. poison or 2d12 points of damage are inflicted) |
| 18 | Inflict photosensitivity upon the user, who suffers a -1 penalty to all die rolls while in daylight |
| 19 | Cause the user’s personal possessions to gradually disappear as if lost. Little things disappear first, then larger possessions, until the user is stripped of all worldly goods. |
| 20 | Cause the user to become forgetful, starting with small details and progressing until full amnesia occurs |

==== Table 1-05: Detection ====
These powers are oriented toward finding and discovering things hidden, but not necessarily unknown. Unless noted, these powers are in effect whenever the artifact is held or worn.

^ Roll ^ Power |
| 1 | Provide a +1 bonus to the user's surprise rolls while the artifact is in hand |
| 2 | Imbue the user with all benefits of the appraisal proficiency |
| 3 | Have //comprehend languages// constantly in effect while the artifact is in hand |

| 18 | Cast //true seeing// (1/day) |
| 19 | Cast //wizard eye// (3/day) |
| 20 | Cast //wizard sight// (3/day) |

==== Table 1-06: Divination ====
Divination is the complement of detection,
revealing things unknown or uncertain. Unlike
most detection abilities, these powers tend to
reveal intangibles—things that cannot and could
not have been seen without the aid of the power.
In most cases the artifact must be touched against
the desired target of the power.

^ Roll ^ Power |
| 1 | Cast //**analyze balance**// by touch (7/day) |

==== Table 1-07: Elemental Air ====

| 19 | Imbue the user with immunity to the hostile environment found on the Elemental Plane of Air and the ability to fly through it normally while the arti- fact is in hand |
| 20 | Send messages in a fashion similar to a whispering wind. The user need only know the name of the recipient before whispering a message to the sky. The user’s voice reaches its target within 24 hours, if that person is on the same plane (at will). |

==== Table 1-08: Elemental Fire ====
These powers grant knowledge of or control of the elemental forces of Fire. Most function identically to the spell of the same name. Some activate by the touch of the artifact while others transfer their power to the wielder.

| 19 | Cast //wall of fire// (1/day) |

^ Roll ^ Power |

| 2 | Cast //cone of cold// (\/day) |
| 3 | Cast //conjure water elemental// (1/week) |

| 6 | Cast //ice storm// (1/day) |
| 7 | Shoot a watery blue beam at a single target. If struck, the target must roll a successful saving throw vs. death magic. If the saving throw fails, the target is slain as the victim melts into a puddle of ooze. If the save is successful, the target still suffers 2d8 points of damage. This power is not effective on water-based creatures or those that lack solid structure (puddings, oozes, jellies.) (1/day). |
| 8 | Empower any basin of water to function as a //magic font// spell by touch (1/day) |

Fire-based attacks cause double damage, while cold-based spells cause no damage but force the user to revert to true form. The power lasts for 1d6 hours or until canceled by the user (1/day). |
| 20 | Open a portal to the Elemental Plane of Water. The passage can be traversed both ways and the portal remains open for 1 hour. Any creature may use the portal. |

==== Table 1-11: Enchantment/Charm ====
These are the charms, holds, suggestions, and other abilities that influence the minds of creatures. Most operate directly through the artifact—the owner must present the device boldly when activating the power. The targets may then be entranced by the power radiating from the artifact.

^ Roll ^ Power |
| 1 | Increase the user’s Charisma score by 3, but the enhancement only affects the opposite gender. The user need not present the artifact, but the power vanishes when the artifact is no longer in possession. |

| 3 | Cast //charm monster// (1/day) |

==== Table 1-12: Fate and Fortune ====
This table is a collection of powers that grant the user the benefits of good fortune. Some powers are straightforward, many are unusual, and a few are quite potent. These powers tend to be automatic as long as the user possesses the artifact.

^ Roll ^ Power |
| 1 | Grant a +1 bonus to all saving throws |
| 2 | Grant a +1 bonus to the user’s THAC0 |
| 3 | Grant a +1 bonus (assuming a high roll is good) to all die rolls for the division of treasure, including magical items (but not other artifacts). This bonus is //mandatory//. |
| 4 | Permanently imbue the user with all knowledge of the gambling proficiency. If the user is already proficient in gambling, add +1 to the ability score. |
| 5 | Grant a +1 bonus to the user’s encounter reaction rolls |
| 6 | Imbue the user with natural luck in combat, granting a +1 bonus to all surprise rolls |
| 7 | Grant a -1 bonus on all of the user’s initiative rolls |
| 8 | Grant the user a change of luck. Once per (game) day, the player can choose to have any die roll rerolled—an attack roll, damage roll, resurrection/survival roll, etc. The second roll is the actual result |
| 9 | Grant the user incredible luck. Once per (game) week, the user’s player can choose to alter any situation by declaring that an incredible event has occurred, (as long as it does not involve magical items or cause the death of a creature), and that incident follows. For example, evil wizards could be made to trip over their own robes in the middle of spellcasting, but could not be made to fall off a cliff. |
| 10 | Grant the user’s adventuring group automatic surprise (1/week) |
| 11 | Allow the user to always find suitable work, despite status or skills |
| 12 | Prevent the user from ever being completely destitute. Should all of the user’s funds be consumed, some lucky chance happens to provide just enough to get by, such as a reward, coins found in the street or a kind stranger. The amount is never great, but it sees to basic needs. |
| 13 | Always grant fair sailing winds to any ship or wind-powered vessel the user is aboard |
| 14 | Prevent the user from ever being the target of pickpockets, thieves, house-breakers, or con artists—except for those who are specifically after the artifact. The power does not prevent general holdups by bandits and the like, only individual thefts. |
| 15 | Prevents merchants from overcharging the user, always offering the best deals |
| 16 | Prevent the user from ever getting lost |
| 17 | Allow the user to always sell goods at 50% greater than normal prices |
| 18 | Prevent the user from ever going hungry. If the user is unable to buy or find food, some fortunate circumstance occurs to provide a meal. A deer may wander too close to camp, or an innkeeper may extend the hand of charity. |
| 19 | Cause the user to always appear innocent of crimes. The user is never suspected or accused of a crime unless there is no other possibility. Even then, plausible explanations cause a reaction roll to see if the story is accepted |
| 20 | Cause all spells cast by the user to operate at maximum effect |

==== Table 1-13: Healing ====
These powers take away the injuries and woes that beset characters and make the world a better place. Most trigger by touching the artifact to the person to be healed or cured. Only a few are continually in effect. The artifact can:

^ Roll ^ Power |
| 1 | Constantly provide the user with the benefits of //**accelerated healing**// |
| 2 | Cast //aid// (5S/day) |
| 3 | Cast //**breath of life**// (1/week) |

| 6 | Cast //cure critical wounds// (2/day) |
| 7 | Cast //cure disease// (3/day) |
| 8 | Cure insanity or restore the mind of one affected by //feeblemind// or similar spells (1/week) |
| 9 | Cast //cure light wounds// (7/day) |
| 10 | Cast //cure serious wounds// (3/day) |
| 11 | Purge a body of the effects of any drug, including drunkenness, by touch (1/day) |
| 12 | Cast //heal// (1/day) |
| 13 | Grant the user the power to heal according to the paladin’s ability to lay on hands |
| 14 | Restore hit points to the user by draining 1d6 points from every other creature within 10’. Drained points are added to the user’s but cannot exceed the original hp total. |
| 15 | Cast //neutralize poison// (3/day) |
| 16 | Cast //raise dead// (1/week) |
| 17 | Cast //regenerate// (1/week) |
| 18 | Place a creature in stasis, halting all further decay and damage. The inert body is immune to gases, fire, cold, or lack of oxygen, but can still be harmed by physical attacks. Damage from these attacks is subtracted immediately, but death does not occur until the stasis is lifted. No further damage affects the body but all damage suffered and poisons still in the system continue their normal course when stasis ends. Only willing targets can be placed in stasis and the effects last 1 week or until the user of the artifact cancels it. Those in stasis are completely static, and not even mental and psionic powers can function (1/week). |
| 19 | Cause all healing spells applied to the user to be doubly effective |
| 20 | Erase scars and other disfigurements caused by battle (at will) |

==== Table 1-14: Immunity ====
These powers are similar to those found on **Table 1-23: Protection**, and prevent the user of the artifact from coming to harm. Those listed here, however, are much more sweeping—they provide a complete shield to certain effects. Unless otherwise noted, immunities are continually in effect—the character need only have the artifact at hand to gain the benefit. The artifact can:

^ Roll ^ Power |
| 1 | Make the user immune to all normal diseases—colds, flu, black death, even food poisoning. This does not include diseases caused by spells or monsters (like mummy rot). |
| 2 | Grant immunity to all magical diseases. While it offers no protection from things as mundane as the common cold or the flu, the immunity works against diseases like mummy rot and the results of cause //disease// spells. |
| 3 | Imbue the user with immunity to //all// forms of disease, both normal and magical |
| 4 | Create immunity to magically caused //fear// |
| 5 | Make the user immune to all forms of gas. The user must still breathe, however, and could suffocate or drown. |
| 6 | Confer immunity to //charm//- and //hold//-based spells and spell-like effects—except those caused by artifacts |
| 7 | Make the user immune to missiles from //magic missile// spells |
| 8 | Imbue the user with immunity to all forms of psionics |
| 9 | Provide immunity to all magical mental attacks. The character is stil! vulnerable, though, to psionic attacks. |
| 10 | Grant immunity to all forms of paralysis, including all //hold//-based spells, and the results of //web// and //entangle// spells |
| 11 | Create immunity to cold temperatures as low as -50°. Saving throws vs. magical cold gain a +2 bonus |
| 12 | Bestows a 20% magic resistance or gives the user a 20% bonus to any existing magic resistance |
| 13 | Impart immunity to all forms of poison |
| 14 | Grant immunity to normal fire and provide a +2 bonus to saving throws vs. all forms of magical fire |
| 15 | Make the user immune to all forms of electrical attack |
| 16 | Make the user immune to energy drains |
| 17 | Imbue the user with complete immunity to illusions, always revealing these as shadowy forms. This power does not reveal anything where the physical form has actually been changed, such as //polymorphed// objects or creatures. |
| 18 | Serves as a moral guide. Whenever the user intends something evil or unlawful, the artifact delivers a powerful, numbing shock. No damage is taken, but the user is paralyzed for 1d6 rounds. The shocks end when the character gives up the intention or the temptation 1s gone. Note that this power is only suitable for lawful good artifacts. |
| 19 | Confer immunity to //polymorph// and //shapechanging// spells and spell-like effects |
| 20 | Make the user immune to petrification |

==== Table 1-15: Major Powers ====
This table is a collection of powerful spells, many of which do not fit well into any other category. These powers must be invoked directly from the artifact and are identical to the spells named.

| 99-00 | Cast //wizard lock// (5/day) |

==== Table 1-17: Movement ====
These powers enhance a character’s ability to maneuver and travel quickly. Since most artifacts cannot carry the user, their powers activate when the artifact is in hand. The artifact can:

^ Roll ^ Power |
| 1 | Cast //air walk// (2/day) |
| 2 | Cast //blink// (3/day) |
| 3 | Cast //**dimensional folding**// (1/day) |

==== Table 1-18: Offensive Powers ====
These are the powers that are coveted by players. Unlike those associated with Table 1-02: Combat, those listed here are not limited to weapons or hand-to-hand combat. These powers must be triggered from the artifact and most function as the spell of the same name.

^ Roll ^ Power |
| 1 | Cast //**age creature**// (1/day) |
| 2 | Cast //Bigby'’s crushing hand// (1/day) |

==== Table 1-20: Necromantic ====
These deadly powers are among the most hideous to be found in any artifact. All affect the life force of creatures. Unless otherwise noted, the artifact must touch the target for the power to be effective.

^ Roll ^ Power |
| 1 | Cast //**Abi-Dalzim’s horrid wilting**// (1/day) |

| 18 | Cast //vampiric touch// (3/day) |
| 19 | Cast //**wail of the banshee**// (1/week) |
| 20 | Cast //wither// (1/week) |

==== Table 1-21: Personal Enhancements ====
Aside from artifacts of massive power, the powers many player characters dream about are personal enhancements—undeserved rewards for simply finding an artifact. Unlike many other powers, those given here can be used virtually without restriction. Unless otherwise stated, these powers last as long as the character owns the artifact. A few are noted as permanent, remaining with the character even after the artifact is gone. Permanent powers take effect as soon as the artifact is touched, but may only be used for a single adventure (or until the owner is dead).

^ Roll ^ Power |
| 1 | Cast //alter self// at will for as long as the artifact is owned |
| 2 | Cast //clairaudience// at will for as long as the artifact is owned |
| 3 | Cast //clairvoyance// at will for as long as the artifact is owned |

| 5 | Provide the user with the effects of //deep-pockets//, regardless of what is worn for as long as the artifact is owned |
| 6 | Imbue the user with invisibility to undead for as long as the artifact is owned |
| 7 | Shield the user continually with //protection from evil/protection from good// (as appropriate to the artifact) for as long as the artifact is owned |
| 8 | Regenerate two of the user’s hit points per turn for as long as the artifact is owned |
| 9 | Cast //feign death// at will for as long as the artifact is owned |
| 10 | Cast //friends// at will for as long as the artifact is owned |
| 11 | Cast //lasting breath// at will for as long as the artifact is owned |

| 13 | Permanently increase the user’s prime requisite score (or scores) by 1 |
| 14 | Give the user the permanent ability to use //comprehend languages// at will |
| 15 | Endow the user with the permanent ability to use //negative plane protection// at will |
| 16 | Grant the user the permanent ability to //speak with monsters// at will |
| 17 | Impart permanent ability to //speak with animals// at will |
| 18 | Provide the user with the permanent ability to //speak with plants// at will |
| 19 | Furnish the permanent ability of //water breathing// at will |
| 20 | Bestow upon the user the ability to use //ventriloquism// at will permanently |

==== Table 1-22: Planar ====
The powers of this table transcend the limitations of single realms of existence, allowing the character access to other dimensions. These powers only function when the artifact is present and most require that they be activated by a specific command.

^ Roll ^ Power |
| 1 | Cast //astral spell// (1/week) |
| 2 | Cast //**astral window**// (1/week) |
| 3 | Cast //binding// (1/week) |
| 4 | Cast //contact higher plane// about any topic other than the artifact or its powers (1/week) |

| 7 | Cast //**estate transference**// (1/month) |
| 8 | Open a gate to a particular island of protomatter in the Ethereal Plane 100’ x 100’ across. This can be used by the character as a residence, storage place, or even prison (2/day). |
| 9 | Create a 10' x 10’ ethereal window, allowing viewing of whatever lies beyond. The window is one-way, so those viewed do not know it is there. Stepping through the window strands the person in the Ethereal Plane (1/day). |
| 10 | Cast //exaction// (1/week) |
| 11 | Cast //**extradimensional manipulation**// (1/week) |
| 12 | Cast //gate// (1/week) |
| 13 | Cast //Mordenkainen'’s magnificent mansion// (2/week) |
| 14 | Imbue the user with the ability to phase like a phase spider (2/day) |
| 15 | Grant the user immunity to the hostile environment of one plane, DM’s choice. This lasts as long as the user owns the artifact. |

| 17 | Cast //plane shift// (1/week) |

| 19 | Summon one nondeity from the outer planes. The name or type of creature must be known. Obedience is not guaranteed (1/month). |
| 20 | Cast //wish// (1/month) |

==== Table 1-23: Protection ====
This table contains powers that enhance the safety of the artifact’s owner and, in some cases, any companions present. Unlike **Table 1-14: Immunity**, not all of these powers are constant nor are they 100% effective. Some function all the time, some require the artifact to be in hand, and others must be invoked by the user.

^ Roll ^ Power |
| 1 | Grant an Armor Class bonus of +2 to the user when held |
| 2 | Function as a //ring of protection +2// when held |
| 3 | Cast //anti-magic shell// (1/day) |

S Cast //armor// upon any creature the artifact touches (5/day)
| 6 | Protect the user constantly with the effects of a //feather fall// spell |
| 7 | Cast //fire shield// (1/day) |
| 8 | Generate a sphere of //forbiddance//, 15’ in radius, centered on the artifact. The forbiddance is not permanent (as is the spell), but has a duration of 2d6 hours. It can be password locked, however (1/week). |
| 9 | Hold //mind blank// in effect as long as the artifact is in hand |
| 10 | Keep //Negative Plane Protection// continually in effect as long as the artifact is in hand, with no saving throw necessary |
| 11 | Maintain //nondetection// constant effect as long as the artifact is in hand |

| 18 | Cast //**unceasing vigilance of the holy sentinel**// (1/week) |

| 20 | Cast //**zone of truth**// (1/week) |

==== Table 1-24: Divination Results ====
Oriental Adventures

^ Roll ^ Result |
| 1-2 | Ill omen. The characters should not undertake any task this day. If this advice is ignored, all characters suffer a -1 on attack rolls and saving throws for the rest of the day. Their chance for encounters are doubled and a -10% reaction modifier is applied to all encounters. |
| 3-4 | Great danger exists. The chance for encounters doubles for the day and a -10 reaction modifier applies to all encounters. Adversaries have a +1 applied to their attack rolls for that day. |
| 5-7 | Neutral omen, no special modifiers apply. |
| 8-9 | Favorable omen. The characters will be able to travel half again their normal traveling rate that day. Opponents will have a —1 on their attack rolls for that day. |
| 10 | Auspicious omen. All the effects of a favorable omen apply. In addition, the characters gain a +1 on all saving throws made that day. |

Enchanted enhancements are magical quirks or additional enchantments that can be added to any item. These can make an item more or less valuable depending upon the enchantment. Each of the random tables supplied in the last volume of this Encyclopedia has a single entry titled “Enchanted Enhancement.” If that is the result of the die roll, refer to the table below to determine the exact type of enhancement.

^ Roll ^ Enhancement Type |
| 01-10 | Anything Item |
| 11-20 | Aquatic* |
| 21-30 | Cloaked Wizardry* |
| 31-40 | Lightweight Equipment* |
| 41-50 | Miniature Gear* |
| 51-60 | Polymorphed Gear* |
| 61-70 | Psionic Dampener* |
| 71-80 | Quirk* |
| 81-90 | Racial Enhancements* |
| 91-00 | Weightless Item* |

Anything Item
**XP Value:** 4,000 **GP Value:** 40,000
Unearthed Arcana
A magical item of this sort appears to be any one of the small, rather weak miscellaneous magic items that are more frequently found— typically one with a limited number of usages, although this is not always true. If the possessor commands it to do so, the item suddenly alters itself to become any other miscellaneous magic item except an artifact or relic. This enables the owner to command the item to become some form of //horn of Valhalla//, for instance.\\
<wrap indent>**Limitations:** No form can ever be repeated. If the item commanded into being is normally destroyed in usage, the //anything item// is also destroyed. If the item duplicated has a short-term, single-use effect (such as a horn or drums), then the //anything item// returns to its original form after one use of that power. If the item has a long-term effect (such as a //helm of underwater action//), the dweomer of the //anything item// lasts for one day (24 hours). In any case, the item disappears after three uses.</wrap>

Aquatic*
XP Value    GP Value
With free action: -25%  -25%
Without free action: -50%   -50%
Dracon Magazine 181
Ideal gear for the fledgling underwater adventurer, these are weapons and suits of armor that have their bonuses only underwater, After all, since the PCs are out of their element underwater, they may need advantages they would not need on dry land. //Aquatic weapons// and armor cost half as much as their normal counterparts. Note that free action is not included in their powers, so an //aquatic long sword +1// is still difficult to swing undersea.\\
<wrap indent>**Free Action:** The DM may provide these weapons and armor with //free action// ability (only while underwater, of course), for an XP value equal to that of a normal, magical weapon or suit of armor. Note that with //free action//, an //aquatic long sword +1// is not difficult to swing undersea.</wrap>

Cloaked Wizardry*
**XP Value:** +800 **GP Value:** +4,000
DRAGON Magazine 179
The item is magical but does not radiate a dweomer upon the casting of a //detect magic// spell (though other divination spells do reveal its true nature). Some items, such as //wings of flying// or a flask ringed with magical writings, are obviously magical despite their “cloaks.”

Drow Treasure*
**XP Value:** +650 **GP Value:** +3,250
FIEND Folio(c) Tome
Cloaks, armor, weapons, and other miscellaneous magical drow treasure have special properties, although they do not radiate magic. The items are made in the strange homeland of the drow, the vast underground cities of carved stone and minerals, places of weird, fantastic beauty inundated with unknown radiations that impart the special properties to drow goods. When these are exposed to direct sunlight, irreversible decay begins and the items become totally useless in 2d6 days. If protected from sunlight, they retain their special properties for 1d20+30 days before becoming normal nonmagical items. If exposed to the radiations of the drow homeland for a period of one week out of every four, the items can remain potent indefinitely. Drow poisons, on the other hand, decay instantly in sunlight and are rendered completely ineffective 60 days after exposure to air, although unopened packets of drow poison remain potent for one year.

Lightweight Equipment*
**XP Value:** +10 **GP Value:** +100
DRAGON Magazine 181
For thieves, mountain climbers, fast scouts, and others in a hurry, these items are extremely useful. Weight and encumbrance may be reduced by half (rounding down) when these weapons and armor are used instead of ordinary ones. No additional advantages are given in combat, though they do count as magical for attack purposes against certain monsters.

Miniature Gear*
**XP Value:** +50 **GP Value:** +500
DRAGON Magazine 181
//Miniaturized items// are shrunken, mundane items, the size of a bit of jewelry or any one of the patches on a //robe of useful items//. When the appropriate command word is spoken, they grow into full-sized, nonmagical weapons, armor, or tools. This gives PCs the ability to smuggle weapons and armor into restricted areas, which can be particularly useful in urban adventures.\\
<wrap indent>The items are no heavier than one-tenth of a pound when small (the dweomer affects weight as well as size), increasing in weight when they expand. //Miniaturized armor// grown large must still be donned normally. This is also useful when the PCs climb vertical surfaces or when encumbrance is an issue. An ogre might chase a small knot of unarmed “peasants” and temporarily lose sight of them, only to discover upon catching up that the enemy is now a ring of heavily armed and armored heroes. The potential for PC and NPC ambushes is obvious.</wrap>

Polymorphed Gear*
**XP Value:** +100 **GP Value:** +1,000
DRAGON Magazine 181
//Polymorphed// items usually come in three basic types: a //brooch// that turns into a suit of armor, a ring that turns into a shield, and a //gem// or //wand// that turns into a weapon, giving the same advantages of lightness and surprise capability as miniature weapons and armor do. With an //armor brooch// or //shield ring//, the armor or shield is already being worn properly once the command word is spoken, whereas //polymorphed// armor must be donned normally. Most //polymorphed// devices produce only one weapon or armor type.

Psionic Dampener*
**XP Value:** **GP Value:**
Normal: +200 +1,000
Self-Dampening: — +600
New Item
This item can be used on any world where psionics are present. The frequency of the item is, of course, determined by the frequency of the psionic ability.\\
<wrap indent>Designed by wizards frustrated by their inability to defend themselves and their laboratories against those wielding the psionic arts, the //psionic dampener// has many applications and guises. Most common are helmets that limit sight, though some designs are collars and manacles that serve the same function.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>//Psionic dampeners//, if placed on a psionic individual, immediately inflict a penalty of -8 to any power score the psionicist has to make, Additionally, if the psionicist attempts to use psionic abilities more than once over the course of a 12-hour period, the //dampeners// inflict a nasty shock worth 1d6 points of damage to the psionicist.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>//Psionic dampeners// are permanently charged items, and require no more maintenance than an ordinary item. They can be removed as any ordinary items of the same variety; thus, a helmet can simply be removed, or manacles unlocked. If the one imprisoning the psionicist takes any precautions against this, the psionicist can be rendered fairly helpless.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>There are also rumors of //psionic dampeners// that inhibit the use of psionics against a person wearing a //dampener//. Unfortunately, the truth of the rumor cannot be confirmed or denied, as no one has found one. Rest assured, however, that if someone has thought of it, someone else has invented it.</wrap>

Quirk*

**XP Value:** --    **GP Value:** --
DRAGON Magazine 163
The AD&D game has one of the largest compilations of magical items in the fantasy gaming industry. The following tables have been created to add some spice and variety to existing magical items in the AD&D game world. A table of nonstandard magical item abilities is offered for each major type of magical item in the AD&D game. The rationale for such quirks is simple.\\
<wrap indent>Most items are created normally, they function exactly as a standard item of the same type in the //DMG//. However, sometimes there is a slight mishap in the creation of the device: the steps are not followed in the proper order, the astrological signs do not bode well, the item’s creator is disturbed to begin with, the instructions are incomplete, or something just plain goes wrong. Any of these results can cause a magical item to behave differently from others just like it.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Not all quirks are bad, however. Some are detrimental to the item or its user, some are neutral, and some are even beneficial. The possibility of quirks existing (and the actual number of quirks) is determined by using the table below; a specific table is thereafter used to determine the exact quirks that the magical item possesses.</wrap>

^ Roll ^ Quirks Present |
| 01-86 | No quirks |
| 87-94 | One quirk |
| 95-98 | Two quirks |
| 99-00 | Three quirks |

^ Roll ^ Result |
| 01-03 | Item has a habit of burying itself in any sack, backpack, or container in which it is carried. If other items are in the container, 1d3 rounds are necessary for someone to find and retrieve the item. |
| 04-07 | Item works normally, but it appears dirty and ready to fall apart. For example, a //cloak of protection +1// might be moth-eaten and stained, but still functional. |
| 08-11 | Item attunes itself to one owner at a time; if it is removed from its owner, or if another person tries to use the device, it goes dormant for 1d4 days as it grows accustomed to its new owner. |
| 12-16 | Item has the annoying habit of buzzing when it is used. The buzzing is audible to anyone within 60 feet, and it is impossible to surprise anyone while the device is buzzing. |
| 17-20 | Item glows with a soft light (as per //faerie fire//) when it is used. |
| 21-24 | Item is durable and makes any necessary saving throws at +2 to the die roll. |
| 25-29 | Item does not function if user wears any kind of head gear or adornment (including a hood). |
| 30-32 | Item cannot function underground. |
| 33 | Item cannot function above ground. |
| 34-36 | Item cannot function at night. |
| 37-38 | Item cannot function during the day. |
| 39-43 | Item is unaffected by blows of any kind, unless the forces are of giant strength (19) or greater. |
| 44-48 | Item has a finite number of uses; it is found with 2d20 charges remaining. Whether or not the item can be recharged is up to the DM. |
| 49-51 | Item works erratically; it functions nor- mally 70% of the time, fails 20% of the time, and acts as a //wand of wonder// 10% of the time. |
| 52-55 | Item is magically buoyant and tends to //levitate// upward at the rate of 5 feet per round unless held or tied down. |
| 56-60 | Item is immune to electricity or magi- cal lightning. If the item is metal, it is also nonconductive. |
| 61-64 | Item can only be used twice per day; if used more often, it shorts itself out and cannot be used for 48 hours. |
| 65-69 | Item causes its owner to become extremely possessive of it. If the item is kept for more than 14 days, a mild form of paranoia sets in. The owner assumes that anyone mentioning the item wants it. The owner never relinquishes the item to anyone as a result. //Remove curse// cast by a 9th-level priest, or getting rid of the item before 14 days pass, are the only ways to negate the paranoia effect. |
| 70-72 | Item is powerful; it works 125% more effectively than a standard item of the same type, and any saving throw against its effects is made at -1. |
| 73-78 | Item is substandard and only works half as well as a standard item of the same type. |
| 79-83 | Item has a curse upon it. All saving throws attempted by its owner are made at -1 until the item has a remove curse cast upon it. |
| 84-86 | Item does not function underwater, unless it is an item specifically designed for underwater use. In that case, it never works outside of a watery environment-50% chance salt water, 50% chance fresh water. |
| 87-90 | Item belongs to an extraplanar creature or other powerful being (this is shown on the item by the creature’s personal sign). After 1d4 weeks, the item is located by the being, and it shows up to claim “its” property. |
| 91-95 | Item must rest for six turns minimum between uses. |
| 96-98 | Item cannot be destroyed by any means short of an incredible excess of force (such as a deity), by dropping it into a lava pit, or the like. |
| 99-00 | Item is intelligent; roll on the **Sword Intelligence Table** (see **Sword**, //Special//) and disregard any result of no intelligence. The item also has an ego; its personality must be determined as well. Though the item does tell its owner of the powers it offers, it never discloses the number of charges it possesses. Note that an intelligent item never willingly uses its last few charges. These items can always be recharged, regardless of type and capabilities. |

Racial Enhancements*
**XP Value:** +150 **GP Value:** +750
DRAGON Magazine 181
Racial weapons, armor, and equipment (the latter including rings and other protective devices) have magical bonuses, but only when being used by members of the race that created them. While it is possible, of course, for humans to make magical items of this sort, their main purpose should be to add more interest in the demihuman and humanoid races. Because these items are not so versatile as regular magical items, even a relatively weak humanoid tribal shaman or witch doctor could make one with a great deal of effort. When the owner fights a foe of another race, he or she always has the satisfaction that a victorious enemy won’t get the same advantage from the magical item that he or she had with it. As for beefing up humanoid foes without upsetting game balance, you could equip an entire tribe of orcs with orcish chain mail +1 and orcish scimitars + 1; if the heroes win anyway, they won’t be able to use one bit of the magical stuff that gave them so much trouble.

Weightless Item*
**XP Value:** +20 **GP Value:** +200
DRAGON Magazine 181
For thieves, mountain climbers, fast scouts, and others in a hurry, these items are extremely useful. Weight and encumbrance may be eliminated altogether when these weapons and armor are used instead of ordinary ones. No additional advantages are given in combat, though they do count as magical for attack purposes against certain monsters.

Abacus of Calculation
**XP Value:** 1,200 **GP Value:** 12,000
DRAGON Magazine 73
This device is a simple wooden frame, about 8 by 10 inches. Several heavy wires are strung across the frame, parallel to one another. On each wire are 10 wooden balls. When mathematical formulas involving numbers (adding, subtracting, multipingly, dividing and simple operations) are spoken near the object, the balls shift about and the answer is spoken aloud by a disembodied voice.

Accelerator
**XP Value:** 4,500 **GP Value:** 45,000
War Captain’s Companion
The //accelerator// is a rapid-fire weapon built by the arcane for use on spelljamming craft of all types. Much in the same way that spelljamming helms gain their magical properties from the spellcasters who sit in them, the //accelerator// gains its magical properties from the activated spelljamming helm. (Without the helm, the //accelerator// is nonfunc-tional.) When first found or purchased, it does not possess any dweomer at all. Only when fitted to a ship with an occupied, functioning spelljamming helm, does it radiate an aura of magic.\\
<wrap indent>Looking much like a gigantic sextant, the //accelerator’s// main arm is a 4-foot-long, 6-inch-diameter hollow tube with a hand-sized cup at one end. The arm can be elevated and swiveled once the weapon is bolted in place, Items placed in the cup are magically seized, accelerated through the arm’s length, and shot out the far end. The weapon can be fired twice in a single round. The range of the weapon is six hexes (6,000 yards). It causes 1d2 points of hull damage to ships and 1d10 points of damage to individuals. On an attack roll of 19 or greater, it inflicts a critical hit.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>When the //accelerator// is aboard a spelljamming ship, it decreases the ship’s total SR by one point, even when the //accelerator// is not mounted or in use. The penalty occurs even if the //accelerator// is merely in the presence of an activated helm. There is no way to block the penalty or regain the lost SR. The weapon-handler must beware. Anything placed in the cup is shot out the other end, including sleeves, knives, daggers, fingers, toes, hands, rocks, helmseekers, etc. Anything living, including any of the vast number of slimes, jellies, and molds, dies when shot by the //accelerator//.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>It is not known if the arcane themselves use this weapon, but apparently only the arcane can repair or service it, should anything damage its delicate mechanisms.</wrap>

Acorn of Wo Mai
**XP Value:** **GP Value:** —
Book of Artifacts
The //acorn of Wo Mai// is a large lead vessel, dull gtay in color. As its name suggests, it is fashioned to look like an enormous acorn, almost 3 feet in height. Two golden bands, inscribed with arcane characters, encircle it from bottom to top, where they meet under a large seal of a dragon coiled around a sword. Although it appears to be tremendously heavy, the artifact can be carried by a strong individual with ease. It sometimes makes faint thumping noises, and is warm to the touch.\\
<wrap indent>According to ancient eastern legend, the //acorn of Wo Mai// is the prison of a powerful fiend who once ruled and terrorized a great empire at the edges of the eastern lands. The fiend was summoned by war-wizards but escaped their control. Hearing of the fiend’s cruelties, the great Wo Mai challenged it to battle. They fought long, the fiend confident, for its life force was hidden far away, and it could not be slain. When Wo Mai discovered this, he bound the fiend in irons that it could not break, Next, he and his companions shaped the acorn, imprisoned the fiend inside, and brought the prize back to the imperial court. When the court fell to barbarian invaders, the acorn was lost.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The acorn is best used if allowed to fall into the hands of the player characters, since its powers (and curse) can create many role-playing opportunities. The PCs could find the acorn as part of a treasure trove, or wrest it from another victim over whom the fiend has gained control. The fiend seeks to seduce a PC to his aid, all the time stressing the need for secrecy. Should it be successful, the fiend manipulates the character and even the entire party into freeing it. Should any PC oppose it, the fiend does its best to turn the others against the enemy.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>To rid themselves of this artifact, the PCs should find some way to bury the acorn away, preferably forever, or they could carry it to the lower planes and open it, trapping the fiend in its own plane.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>**Invoked Powers:** The fiend within the acorn provides good advice (Int 20), telepathically providing answers to questions posed by its owner. It grants the ability to //polymorph any object// (1/day).</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>**Random Powers:** Three from the Artifact Table 1-16: Minor Powers.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>**Curse:** The fiend trapped within the acorn is an evil demigod and craves its release more than anything else. It is aware of its surroundings, particularly the life forces of creatures nearby, and uses its powers (and advice) to persuade its owner to free it from its prison. Once freed, of course, it rewards its former master with death.</wrap>\\

<wrap indent>**Suggested Means of Destruction:**\\
* The seal must be broken with a +5 weapon upon the throne of the Emperor.
* The inscribed characters on the golden bands must be erased.
* It must be cast into a volcano of Carceri.

Air Spores
**XP Value:** 500 **GP Value:** 2,500
Tome of Magic
Rumors indicate that the famed wizard Mordom created these odd, pollen spores. Only a few wizards know how to make them today. //Air spores// that still exist are usually sequestered as specimens of study in the labs of powerful wizards.\\
<wrap indent>When //air spores// are ingested by a creature, the spores work their way into the creature’s lungs. There they grow, reproduce, and die. While living out their lives, they create oxygen that the host body can use to breathe when deprived of oxygen from the environment. The spores can live for 2d4 days.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>In a normal environment, the spores hinder the character’s normal respiration, causing all Constitution checks to be made with a -4 penalty. Fortunately, 12 hours of breathing in a normal environment for each day the spores were used will clear the lungs of the colony.</wrap>

Chandrasakar’s
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 5,000
1992 Fantasy Collector Card 394
It is rumored that Chandrasakar saved a crew of Reigar with these special //air spores//. The story goes that he was deep in wildspace, in a stolen elven flitter, when he encountered a Reigar ship whose air envelope had been exhausted. Chandrasakar had ingested some stolen, space-borne air spores and no longer required an oxygen envelope to sustain him. While attempting mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on a Reigar, it soon became clear that the //air spores// were transmittable, which saved the entire Reigar crew.

 
Al-Azid's Ghostly Palace
**XP Value:** 4,000 **GP Value:** 40,000
Secrets of the Lamp
This huge palace of fine white marble and slender minarets is magically linked to the Ethereal Plane. It can be called into existence from that plane by the owner of the magical key to the palace’s front gate. The owner of the key can summon the //ghostly palace// whenever needed, though it is only visible at night, when its walls shine in the darkness. By day the palace is invisible from the outside, though once inside, visitors can see its features easily.\\
<wrap indent>The chambers within are well appointed, and gentle fountains play. Invisible musicians strum soothing tunes, and unseen servants take care of whatever cleaning, cooking, and menial chores the owner demands with a clap of the hands.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>//Al-Azid’s ghostly palace// is also subject to a curse, cast by Al-Azid to prevent others from enjoying his mansion after his death. Whoever bears the key that opens its doors is perpetually haunted by an invisible stalker.</wrap>

Amulet

Amulets are magical devices that are commonly worn around the neck, suspended from a chain. The type of chain that comes with an amulet generally increases the item’s aesthetic value, not its magical properties. Amulets can also be pinned to a shirt, cloak, or headband, but not boots, hats, or gloves. Only one amulet can be attached to an article of clothing and only one can be dangled from the neck.\\
<wrap indent>In the AD&D game system, some amulets have restrictions, particularly if they were created to be used in a specific campaign world.</wrap>

of the Abyss
**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 6,000
DUNGEON Magazine 13
On the Prime Material Plane, an //amulet of the Abyss// is indeed rare, but it is an item commonly worn by honored guests when traveling through certain layers of the Abyss. The amulet consists of a 36-inch silver chain from which hangs a disk of tooled adamantite about 3 inches in diameter. Some type of identifying mark is placed on the amulet’s front, and its inscribed back (in Tanar’ri) bears the name of the wearer and the areas to which access is allowed. Amulets usually radiate magic and possess a strong aura of evil.\\
<wrap indent>The amulet enables the wearer to //summon tanar’ri aid// twice per day. At the wearer’s option, it may summon 1d6 manes or 1-2 dretch. All //summoning// is done indirectly through Arzial, a baron serving under Graz’zt, and is subject to possible denial. If approved, the //summoned// creatures serve without question and remain for 3d6 hours or until dismissed. The summoning requires 1-8 rounds, depending on the speed of the baron’s answer. Summoning may be performed only by evil persons with knowledge of the correct idiom and pronunciation of tanar’ri names. Any neutral PC attempting to summon creatures suffers 1d10 hp damage per attempt. Any PC of good alignment suffers 3d8 hp damage, and there is a 10% chance of attracting the attention of Arzial. The amulet may be used to communicate with Arzial directly, once per month, with two questions per contact. The answers received are not always correct, and Arzial dislikes frequent contact.</wrap>

Against Crystal Balls & ESP
**XP Value:** 4,000 **GP Value:** 15,000
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Expert Rules Set
The wearer of this item is automatically protected from being spied on by someone using a //crystal ball// or any type of //ESP//.

Against Disease
**XP Value:** 350 **GP Value:** 1,000
The Glory of Rome
This Roman magical item is an amulet inscribed to various gods and spirits of healing. It functions as a //periapt of health// (total protection vs. disease), but only against one specific form of disease or illness.

of Amiability
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** 3,500
POLYHEDRON Newszine 43
This amulet of unassuming appearance emits a dweomer of magic, but there is no way to tell the exact effect of the amulet short of trying it on. Once the amulet is on, the wearer is unable to take it off unless //remove curse// or //dispel magic// is cast. Any person wearing the amulet regardless of race, class, or alignment becomes incredibly nice, kind, and. thoughtful. While the wearer cannot do anything to hurt him or herself, the victim of this “blessing” does everything possible to help those around him or her and falls in with their plans and suggestions. He or she freely gives away possessions, bestows spells, tries to be friendly with everyone (even monsters), helps others with camp chores—this character is “at your service.” The wearer is appalled at the thought of theft and refuses to take treasure that belongs to someone else. The victim does not attack. If confronted by a monster or a hostile party member, gifts are offered and peace is sought. The character tries to explain to the attacker why everyone should live in love, peace, and harmony.\\
<wrap indent>Note that the amulet does not actually alter a person’s alignment, it only forces one to act ina friendly, helpful manner despite alignment. Actions under this enchantment do not endanger alignment in any way. The amulet also gives a +7 bonus to the existing Armor Class of the wearer and gives a bonus of +7 to all saving throws. The wearer is further endowed with the ability to conjure up infinite quantities of chocolate chip cookies (6 at a time) and fresh flowers (a handful at a time) simply by concentrating.</wrap>

of Arachnid Control
**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 8,000
War Captain’s Companion
This amulet can control one giant or 1d10 normal arachnids of any type. This includes beings who have magically assumed arachnid form in whole or in part. Arachnids are allowed a saving throw if they have an Intelligence of three or better. Unlike the //ring of arachnid control//, all neogi (even the Great Old Masters) must make a saving throw vs. spell at a -2 penalty in order to avoid being magically compelled to obey the command of the amulet’s wearer. (If successful, the neogi can choose whether or not to obey.)

of the Beast
**XP Value** **GP Value**
Ivory: — 3,500
Silver: — 5,000
RAVENLOFT® Campaign Set
Two versions of the amulet exist—one is made of silver, the other of ivory. Both show the image of a wild, wolfish beast bonded in chains. Each amulet is round, and has a small hole at the top for threading a cord or chain.\\
<wrap indent>The silver amulet functions only when worn by a lycanthrope, As long as the creature carries the amulet somewhere on his or her person, lycanthropy is suppressed. Even a true lycanthrope cannot change shape while holding the silver amulet. No magical force prevents its removal, but the owner may protect it by other means.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The ivory amulet, when touched to a character, gives its victim the symptoms of lycanthropy. (It does not affect creatures who are already lycanthropes.) Most ivory amulets produce “werewolves,” but a given amulet could mimic any form of the disease. The amulet is magically attached to its owner until a //remove curse// spell is cast. Even then, the victim must save vs. spell successfully to be free of the amulet. Not every victim wants such freedom, however. When the amulet is gone, so are the symptoms of lycanthropy.</wrap>

of the Cairn Hills
**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 18,000
GREYHAWK® Adventures
Originally created to protect the common folk from the spirits that haunt these hills, this amulet has become a favorite among grave robbers. It allows a saving throw vs. spell to avoid any special attacks from undead (aging, energy drain, fear, disease, Strength drain), Physical attacks and spells cast by undead are unaffected. A successful saving throw against an undead attack uses one charge, except the following: a two-level energy drain uses two charges, and aging uses one charge per 10 years of aging. The amulet has 2d10 charges and is not rechargeable.

Cartographer’s
**XP Value:** 3,000 **GP Value:** 21,000
Revenge of Alphaks
This amulet, constructed from a huge flawless jacinth, is cut into a lens-shaped disk 6 inches in diameter and % inch thick. It has a platinum setting and chain. Twelve diamond chips are placed at 30° intervals on the left side of the setting and a single rune surrounds the top chip.\\
<wrap indent>With the proper command words, the user can direct the amulet to display a scale map of the immediate, surrounding area once every three days. Remaining on the face of the amulet for one turn, the map can show either a small or large area. The rune indicates true north. The amulet must be held in the user’s hand when the command word is spoken.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The small area map, when used indoors, shows the area within the 60-foot, radial area of the amulet. The map shows passages, stairways, doors, and other normal features such as fountains, furnishings and loose treasure. The user sees in the amulet what would be seen viewing the displayed area with normal vision in daylight. The map does not however, reveal traps, secret doors, creatures, nor the nature of what is shown.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Once the map is invoked, the user can describe up to four objects and the amulet locates them by number on the map. The user must know exactly what each object is. It is possible that secret doors or very familiar types of traps could be located in the same manner. If there are two or more of a particular object within range, only the one closest to the amulet is shown. The user can describe the same object more than once, up to a limit of four times.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Outdoors, the small area map displays the area within a 60-yard radius of the amulet showing hills, cave mouths, buildings, and other terrain features. Hidden objects do not appear if the user could not discern them in daylight using normal vision, although they may be located if the user possesses the proper description.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The large area map can only be used outdoors and shows the area within a 3-league radius of the amulet. The map is, out of necessity, less detailed than the small area map but otherwise has the same features. The user can command the amulet to locate only two special objects when using the map.</wrap>

of Caterpillar Control
**XP Value:** 5 **GP Value:** 25
DRAGON Magazine 30
The //amulet of caterpillar// control allows the wearer to control the actions of 4 to 24 garden caterpillars.

of Charm Resistance
**XP Value** **GP Value**
+3: 1,500 8,000
+4; 2,000 10,000
Top Ballista
These small amulets of brass or bronze allow the wearer to save against all charm effects (//charm person// spells, the //charm song// of a harpy, the //charm// of a vampire) with a +4 bonus.

of Charming
**XP Value:** 2,500 **GP Value:** 12,500
POLYHEDRON Newszine 50
Anyone viewing the amulet is favorably disposed to the wearer (saving throw vs. spell negates the effect). Furthermore, the wearer’s Charisma and comeliness are raised 3 points.

of Cheetah Speed
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 4,000
DUNGEON Magazine 15
This is an ordinary silver amulet engraved with the silhouette of a long-legged cat on one side. The movement rate of anyone wearing this amulet increases by 2. Once per day, the wearer can run at the speed of a cheetah (MV 45 for three rounds). This amulet works only for lightly encumbered characters wearing nonbulky or no armor.

of Communication
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 5,000
Kara-Tur
This amulet allows a person to communicate clearly with anyone who understands another dialect of the same parent tongue. The maker of the amulet must know the parent tongue at the time the amulet is constructed. These amulets are much favored by foreign merchants and are commonly found at the gatherings of the Issacortae chieftains each year. Bearers of these amulets are oftern recognized as special messengers.

of Dragon Warding
**XP Value:** 8,000 **GP Value:** 47,500
DRAGON MOUNTAIN® Campaign Set
The //amulet of dragon warding// has the following powers: it acts as //bracers, AC 0// and as a //ring of spell turning//. The amulet glows with a pure gold light. Any character touching it knows all of its powers.

of Dramatic Death
**XP Value:** 300 **GP Value:** 1,500
The Complete Thief’s Handbook
Only a few of these prized items exist, each created for a high-level thief who was in the service of two powerful spellcasters, a wizard and an illusionist. They combined their skills to create these unique items. There are six amulets known, which differ from each other in only one respect; all have the following common properties—the magic of amulet is activated when the wearer suffers one particular attack form (and only that attack form) that would be sufficient to kill or wholly disable the wearer (such as by petrification). Damage sustained from the attack is wholly negated, and special attacks (such as petrification) are likewise negated. The thief is at once made //invisible//. Lastly, a powerful, programmed illusion is brought into operation so that the wearer of the amulet appears to have been slain or disabled by the attack. The programmed illusion is both complete and dramatic—an amulet protecting against magical fire shows the victim of fireball attack as a burned corpse, complete with the smell of roasted flesh. Only direct, tactile checks or a powerful divination spell can reveal the illusion for what it is. The amulet functions once per day. Roll 1d6 on the table below to determine the single attack form that the amulet protects against.

^ Roll ^ Specific Protection |
| 1 | Magical fire (includes red dragon breath and all other forms). |
| 2 | Lightning and Electrical attacks |
| 3 | Cold-based attacks |
| 4 | Petrification |
| 5 | Edged Weapons |
| 6 | Blunt Weapons |

Draskilion’s Amulet of Life
**XP Value:** 5,000 **GP Value:** 50,000

Though only one of these devices is known to exist, it stands to reason that others may be created if its secrets are discovered.\\
<wrap indent>Originally an //amulet of life protection//, this powerful item functions as follows: After the construction of the amulet is completed, the first living creature with an essence who touches the item is then attuned to it. When that being’s body is destroyed, its essence is immediately absorbed into the amulet. The being whose essence is contained by it is fully cognizant of what is going on in his, her, or its environment. The occupant must then wait for the amulet to be placed about the neck of another creature. At that time, the occupant may attempt to dominate the new body.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>There is a base 25% chance of a successful domination, For every point of Intelligence above or below that of the intended host, 10% is added to or subtracted from the odds. For every point of Wisdom above or below that of the intended host, 8% is added to or subtracted from the chance. For example, if the occupant’s statistics are Intelligence 17 and Wisdom 16 and the victim’s are Int 13 and Wis 15, the chance for successful possession is 73% (base chance of 25% plus 40% for superior Intelligence plus 8% for superior Wisdom = 73%). The struggle for control is totally internal and has no visible sign, nor is the victim alerted. After an unsuccessful domination attempt, the victim feels suddenly fatigued. Attempts can be made to possess the body every six turns.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>As soon as domination is successful, the invader is in full control of the body and possesses all of the host’s abilities (spells, combat skills, and all other skills). The host’s essence is transferred into the amulet. Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma are that of the victim, but Intelligence, Wisdom, and personality are that of the possessor. If an invader continues to wear the amulet, the victim may try to regain possession with a base 25% chance plus or minus modifiers for Intelligence and Wisdom.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>This particular amulet is enchanted with a powerful //suggestion spell//. Anyone touching it must save vs. spell at -5 to keep from putting the device about his or her neck. A save is required for every round a person is in contact with it.</wrap>

of Emotions
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 5,000
The Revenge of Rusak
This amulet is identical to any other magical amulet. When worn or carried, the user does not notice any effect. However, the amulet magically alters a person’s appearance to match his or her emotions of the moment, but greatly exaggerates them. Thus, rage and anger make the person appear horrific and hideous, fear makes the wearer appear weak and sniveling with mousy features, and milquetoast eyes. Once the amulet is put on it can only be removed by a //remove curse// spell.

of Extension
**XP Value:** 1,200 **GP Value:** 6,000
Tome of Magic
When desired by the caster, this amulet can be used to increase the duration of |st- and 2nd-level spells by 50%, and the duration of 3rd- and 4th-level spells by 25%. Fractions of 4 and above are rounded up (for example, a spell with duration of 1 round extended to 14 rounds is rounded to 2 rounds). Fractions less than 4 are rounded down (a spell with | round duration extended to 14% rounds is rounded down to one round and thus gains no benefit from the amulet).\\
<wrap indent>The amulet has no effect on spells with instantaneous or permanent durations. A maximum of 1d10+4 spell levels can be affected by the amulet each day. Each amulet has its own individual limit, secretly determined when it is found. If this limit is exceeded on any given day, the amulet shatters and is destroyed permanently.</wrap>

of Far Reaching
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 5,000

When willed by a caster, this amulet increases the range of 1st-level spells by 30%, 2nd-level spells by 20%, and 3rd-and 4th-level spells by 10%. Fractions of  and greater are rounded up—all others rounded down.\\
<wrap indent>The amulet affects only range and does not alter a spell’s area of effect. The amulet cannot affect spells with ranges of 0 or touch.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>A maximum of Id10+4 spell levels can be affected by the amulet each day. Each amulet has an individual limit—secretly determined when found.</wrap>

Fiend
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** —
FIEND FOLIO Tome
Fiend lords and princes maintain their vital essences in small containers, so they are at onceprotected and yet vulnerable if some enterprising character should gain the amulet. Fiends with //amulets// are able to //magic jar// once per day. //Fiend amulets// cannot be detected as such by any magical means, and they do not otherwise appear unusual in any way. The device need not be with the most powerful princes, although the lesser fiends typically need to carry them on or near their person.\\
<wrap indent>Possession of an amulet gives the possessor power over the fiend to whom it “belongs” for the span of, for example, one adventure, and never more than a day (24 hours). The amulet must then be returned to the fiend—or it can be destroyed, condemning the prince to the Abyss for one year (it may return after that only if summoned). The use of these amulets is very, very dangerous. Possession of one doubles the chance of calling the attention of another fiend, and any fiend not controlled by the device immediately attacks the person possessing such an amulet. If the amulet leaves the hand of the one commanding the fiend to whom it belongs, that fiend attacks in its most effective fashion, immediately, trying to slay the former possessor. If successful, it carries all that remains to its own domain, and the character is lost and gone forever. On the positive side, however, if the wielder of the amulet carefully repays the fiend for aid rendered, then adds a considerable sum for having the temerity to dare to command the fiend in the first place, and carefully restores the amulet to the fiend, the prince might not bear a grudge forever afterward—nor seek to hunt its former master whenever possible.</wrap>

Temple of Death
These amulets work in pairs. Anyone wearing one may see through the amulet of a person wearing another. Each user sees whatever is in range of the other’s amulet.

Furyondy’s
**XP Value:** 1,400 **GP Value:** 7,000
GREYHAWK Adventures
The first of these amulets was enchanted to protect the good natives of Furyondy, though they have since been used by characters of many lands and alignments. Hung around the neck from a silver chain, the amulet bestows a //remove curse// upon any wearer who is cursed. The amulet glows, expending one charge, and any curse subject to the spell //remove curse// is broken. For example, it immediately allows a character to be rid of a cursed item, such as a //helm of alignment change//, although it does not cure lycanthropy. The amulet has 1d6+1 charges and cannot be recharged.

of the Golden Collar
**XP Value:** 1,500 **GP Value:** 12,000
IMAGINE Magazine 16
This amulet was designed to help a mummy free itself from its bandages on the long journey to the afterlife. A living user, however, can use the amulet to break any magical or nonmagical bonds. This includes the //rope of entanglement//, //web// spells, dexterously knotted ropes, and other forms of confinement. It takes one full round for the amulet to break the character free. It can be used twice per day.

Greenstone
**XP Value:** 5,000 **GP Value:** 30,000
DraGON Magazine 39
These rare, highly prized devices are fist-sized green stones made by some forgotten magical process. They glow when in operation and are quite brittle. Worn next to the skin, they confer upon the wearer the protection (spell immunities) of a mind blank spell, as well as immunity to: //chaos//, //forget//, //geas//, //hold person//, //hypnotism// (but not hypnotic pattern or fire charm); //mass charm//, //quest//, //scare//, and //sleep//. The wearer also gains +4 on saving throws against: //fumble//, //ray of enfeeblement//, and //trip//, and is allowed a saving throw against both //Otto’S irresistible dance// and //maze// spells. (If successful, the duration of effect of any spell is reduced by half, rounding up.)\\
<wrap indent>These amulets may be worn by any class of character. The protection they give is involuntary. (The wearer cannot actually communicate //telepathically//, even if he or she so desires.) Protection only extends to 11-44 (1d4x11) spell levels before the amulet is exhausted. (For this purpose, protection against a psionic power drains the levels of the equivalent spell.) Note that the amulet only counters the listed spells, and is in no way affected by other spells (for instance //lightning bolt//). Exhaustion is mentally evident to the wearer, and visually evident to others; the amulet blazes brightly for 30 seconds before slowly fading to darkness. The amulet recharges at the rate of one spell level per turn, but it does not counter spells for which it lacks sufficient power to negate—that is, it does not provide partial protection.</wrap>

Hands of the Healing Spirit
**XP Value:** 5,500 **GP Value:** 10,000
Tales of the Lance
This elegant amulet is made of white gold. The amulet is a circle formed by three crooked arms, with three hands clasped together at its center. The amulet was crafted during the Age of Dreams by Sirrion and given to Mishakal so that she would intercede with Shinare for him. In time, the amulet came into the possession of Trae Jerrold, who gave it to Mirri Witikell upon their betrothal. The wicked schemes of Hiddukel betrayed the young lovers, entrapping Mirri’s life force in the amulet itself. According to a mystic prophecy, “Mirri shall one day find rest with the spirits of her lover and his brother.”\\
<wrap indent>Eventually, the //hands of the healing spirit// fell into the possession of Huma of the Lance, given to him by his uncle. When Huma at last admitted his love for the elf maid Gwynneth (the silver dragon El’liolle or “Silver Heart”) he gave her this amulet as a pledge. Gwynneth wisely gave the amulet to her younger sister Dargent before she followed Huma through death’s doorway. Dargent honored Gwynneth by taking the name of Silvara when she moved among mortals as a wild elf.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Centuries passed before the amulet again changed hands. This time it was given to a wild ogre of unexpected wit and compassion, who tried to lead his people away from darkness and into harmony. After the Cataclysm, the amulet was held by a mad gnome named Fractore Gearslip, the dark wizard Dalamar, and the kender Glendoll Allseer. At last, it returned to the dragon Dargent. Fate has decreed that the amulet must one day be given to another mortal who captures Dargent’s heart.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The amulet detects only minor magic, for its might comes from the spirit of Mirri trapped within. It adds a +3 bonus to saves against all poisons and diseases and adds a +3 bonus to the wearer’s Wisdom, allowing spell bonuses to priests. It continuously radiates an aura equal to a //protection from evil 10-foot radius// spell.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Once per day, the wearer can cast one of every healing spell: //cure blindness or deafness//; //cure critical wounds//, //cure disease//, //cure light wounds//, //cure serious wounds//, //heal//, and //neutralize poison//. It can evoke //continual light// as well. However, each time an effect is invoked, the user must make a system shock roll or become exhausted for 1d6 turns.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The //hands of the healing spirit// promotes harmony and cooperation, and grants a +3 to all reaction rolls made by the wearer. Further, the wearer slowly begins to shift alignment toward neutral good, and is repeatedly drawn to provide succor for the oppressed and aid for the injured. This artifact doubles the healing rate of the wearer and protects against the infirmities of time and age, keeping the body healthy and vibrant. The wearer is undying.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The //hands of the healing spirit// is one of the three artifacts in the Circle of Love, created by Mishakal to end the war between two noble families. The spirit of Mirri’s love is in the amulet, Trae and his brother Heris are trapped in the other two artifacts: //the ring of nature's healing// and the //armband of Trueheart’s warding//. The //hands of the healing spirit// oppose the //coin of greed// in the //Triad of Betrayal//, artifacts created by Hiddukel.</wrap>

Hardwater
**XP Value:** 300 **GP Value:** 1,500
Otherlands
This beautiful, starburst amulet is made of clear crystal and is practically invisible on the wearer. Activated by the wielder’s will, it can harden water to a granite like consistency. The user can create walls or hurl bolts of hard water at enemies. The volume of //hardened water// is equal to 30,000 square feet. This can be a single large mass or several small ones. The user can shape it into any desired form. The bolts cause 4d8 points of damage (half with a successful saving throw vs. breath weapon) and can be used five times a day. It requires no command word, but the wielder does incur a +3 initiative penalty when using the //hardwater amulet//.

Health

Cursed: — 2,000
Standard: 2,000 10,000
Kara-Tur
A common Northern belief is that illness is a form of possession, the influence of evil spirits that have taken control of the afflicted person’s spirit. A fever, for example, stems from the spirit’s subjection to flames inflicted by evil spirits. For this reason, many //health amulets// also protect from possession, or even have powers of //exorcism//. //Health amulets// come in countless varieties. The //moiganis//, for example, is supposed to protect against diseases of the lungs. It is left to the DM to devise individual //health amulets// and empower them.\\
<wrap indent>For example: One powerful //moiganis// may keep the bearer from contracting any lung ailments and may in addition provide a bonus of +4 on saving throws against inhaled spore attacks (yellow mold, basidirond—others).</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Cursed //health amulets// increase the chance of contracting diseases, or reduce the bearer’s chance to save successfully against appropriate attack forms.</wrap>

of the Hero
**XP Value:** 300 **GP Value:** 1,500
POLYHEDRON Introductory Issue
This amulet generates three heroes, one at a time, who are 8th-level fighters, have 80 hit points, and an AC of 2. When the command words are spoken, the hero appears, ready to do the bidding of the amulet’s owner. Once a hero is called, a new hero cannot be generated until the old one dies. However, the hero cannot hit anything, nor successfully accomplish any task—he or she always fails. The hero cannot leave until slain by an enemy, nor can the hero take his or her own life. All damage to the hero is permanent and cannot be healed by any means short of a //wish//. The hero always remains within 300 yards of the owner of the amulet. In addition, the hero must always walk; riding a mount is impossible.

DUNGEON MASTER Guide, 1st Edition
This prized emblem is an especially blessed symbol that enables the wearer to turn undead like a priest. The amulet seems ordinary, but glows brightly when strongly presented (as if it were a //holy symbol//) in the presence of undead. The success of the attempt to turn is determined by the power of the amulet—the strength of each amulet varies, and when one is discovered, its type is ascertained by rolling on the following table:\\

^ Dice \\Roll ^ Effective Priestal\\ Level of Amulet |
| 01-30 | 5th level |
| 31-55 | 6th level |
| 56-75 | 7th level |
| 76-90 | 8th level |
| 91-00 | 9th level |

It must be worn at all times to remain effective. When not worn, it becomes inert, remaining inactive for the first 7 days it is again worn.\\
<wrap indent>**In Ravenloft:** Undead are more difficult to control than in other realms. //Amulets against the undead//, like the //amulet of holy turning//, work one level below their usual capacity while in the demiplane.</wrap>

These items increase the bearer’s chance of hunting successfully. In game terms, the character gains up to +5 on all hunting skill rolls. If the character does not possess the hunting skill, this amulet bestows it.\\

of Immunity to Charm

Top Ballista
These rare amulets are identical to //amulets of charm resistance// but offer total immunity to all forms of magical charm unless produced by a //limited wish// or //wish//.

of Inescapable Location
**XP Value:** **GP Value:** 1,000
DUNGEON MASTER Guide, 1st Edition
This device is typically worn on a chain or as a brooch. It appears to be an amulet that prevents location, scrying (//crystal ball// viewing and the like), or detection or influence by //ESP// or //telepathy//. Actually, the amulet doubles the likelihood and range of these location and detection modes. Normal item identification attempts, including //detect magic//, do not reveal their true nature.

of Insect Repellency
**XP Value:** 300 **GP Value:** 1,500
DRAGON Magazine 73
This is a piece of jade carved in the shape of an insect 1-inch long and suspended from a light chain. The amulet keeps fleas and other insects of similar size from approaching within 3 feet of the wearer. It does not force them out of an area or location, so it could not be used, for example, to clear a bed of fleas.

Kaleen’s Undead Stone
**XP Value:** 6,000 **GP Value:** 30,000
1992 Fantasy Collector Card 243
Kaleen’s magical amulet is a particularly potent version of a typical //amulet vs. undead//, allowing Kaleen to turn undead as if a 12th-level priest. The amulet also holds at bay forms of undead that are normally immune to the effects of turning unless those creatures roll a successful saving throw vs. spell. Failure means that the undead creature must remain at least 5 feet from the holder of the amulet.

of Lathander
**XP Value:** 6,000 **GP Value:** 30,000
POLYHEDRON Newszine 82
This hammered platinum amulet was fashioned by the high-level, specialty priests of Lathander, the god of Dawn on Abeir-Toril, the world of the FORGOTTEN REALMS® campaign setting. If the wearer of the amulet falls during combat (reduced to 0 hit points or less), the amulet heals 1d6 points of damage. This function of the amulet operates up to three times a day.\\
<wrap indent>If the amulet is worn by a priest of Lathander, and that priest falls during combat, the amulet casts a //heal// spell upon the priest. This function operates up to three times a day.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The amulet can only be worn by individuals of good alignment. Others trying to don this amulet suffer 3d6 points of damage per round until it is removed.</wrap>

of Leadership
**XP Value:** 5,000 **GP Value:** 25,000
Tome of Magic
This amulet bestows a character of any level the ability of a 9th-level fighter to attract men-at-arms. The amulet does not attract additional men-at-arms to a fighter who has already gained followers.\\
<wrap indent>A fighter normally gains troops at 9th level because the warrior’s name is so well known that he or she attracts the loyalty of other warriors. The amulet works in much the same way. When a stranger meets a character wearing the amulet, the stranger perceives the character to be a leader who is destined for greatness, regardless of the character’s class. Just as the reputation of a 9th-level fighter spreads, so the reputation of the person wearing the amulet spreads. Roll 14100 to determine followers:</wrap>

^ Roll ^ Followers (all 0 level) |
| 01-50 | 20 calvary with ring mail, shield, 3 javelins, long sword, hand axe; 100 infantry with scale mail, polearm (player selects type), and club. |
| 51-75 | 20 infantry with splint mail, morning star, hand axe; 60 infantry with leather armor, pike, and short sword. |
| 76-90 | 40 infantry with chain mail, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, and military fork. |
| 91-99 | 10 cavalry with banded mail, shield, lance, bastard sword, and mace; 20 cavalry with scale mail, shield, lance, long sword, and mace; 30 cavalry with studded leather armor, shield, lance, and long sword. |
| 00 | DM’s option—Barbarians, headhunters, armed peasents, extra-heavy cavalry, etc. |

<wrap indent>If the amulet is lost or destroyed, the followers immediately lose faith in their leader. They gradually depart or desert. Once this occurs, the character’s reputation is sullied such that he or she can never gain the benefit of the amulet again. The fighter can, of course, gain followers normally upon reaching the 9th level.</wrap>

of Life Protection
**XP Value:** 5,000 **GP Value:** 20,000
DUNGEON MASTER Guide, 1st Edition
This amulet serves as protection for the psyche. The wearer is protected from //magic jar// and similar mental attacks that usurp control of the wearer’s body. If the wearer is slain, the psyche enters the amulet and is protected for seven full days. After that, it departs to the plane of its alignment. If the amulet is destroyed during the seven days, the psyche is utterly and irrevocably annihilated.
<wrap indent>**In Ravenloft:** As long as the //amulet of life protection// is in Ravenloft, a captured psyche cannot leave the demiplane. If the amulet is removed from Ravenloft, the psyche can depart.</wrap>

of Magic Resistance
**XP Value** **GP Value**
5%: 5,000 25,000
10%: 6,000 30,000
15%: 7,000 35,000
20%: 8,000 40,000
25%: 9,000 45,000
30%: 10,000 50,000
Tome of Magic
This powerful amulet grants the wearer a degree of magic resistance ranging from 5% to 30%. The level of magic resistance is determined when the amulet is found by rolling 1d6 and multiplying the result by 5. Any time the amulet is worn and a spell is cast at the wearer, the wearer is allowed a percentile roll to avoid the full effects of the spell.\\
<wrap indent>Only 50% of these amulets confer magic resistance against all spells. The remaining 50% extend magic resistance only to spells of 1st through 6th levels. These amulets have no effect on more powerful spells. The DM should secretly determine this when the item is discovered.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>All such amulets, regardless of the degree of resistance conferred, are delicate, magical structures. If the wearer rolls for magic resistance and the roll is 95-00, this fragile item shatters into useless scrap.</wrap>

^ Roll ^ Magic Resistance |
| 01-14 | 5% for spell levels 1 through 6 |
| 15-26 | 10% for spell levels 1 through 6 |
| 27-35 | 15% for spell levels 1 through 6 |
| 36-42 | 20% for spell levels 1 through 6 |
| 43-47 | 25% for spell levels 1 through 6 |
| 48-50 | 30% for spell levels 1 through 6 |
| 51-00 | Resistance to spell levels 1 through 9 instead of just 1 through 6. Roll again, ignoring results of 51-00. |

of Metaspell Influence
**XP Value:** 3,000 **GP Value:** 15,000
Tome of Magic
This amulet does not appear to have any magical function (although it radiates magic if detection is used) until it is worn by someone using one of the dilation, far-reaching, or extension spells. When such a spell is cast, the amulet adds 50% to the functional effect of the spell. For example, if //extension I// is used to increase the duration of a 3rd-level spell by 50%, the wearer of this amulet can add another 50%, raising it to a 75% extension effect.

of Neutrality
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 5,000
Fate of Istus
The //amulet of neutrality// is generally used by evil individuals to shield their evil nature and make them seem neutral to all dweomers. (Thus, //know alignment//, and similar spells show the wearer to be neutral, with respect to evil and good—//protection from evil// and equivalent spells won’t keep them away.)

Noseeum
**XP Value:** 5,000 **GP Value:** 25,000
Unidentified
This device protects the wearer against all divination spells and magical location and detection. The wearer cannot be detected through //clairaudience//, //clairvoyance//, //ESP//, //telepathy//, //crystal balls//, or any other scrying devices. No aura is discernible on the wearer, and predictions cannot be made regarding the character unless a powerful being is consulted.

Cursed: — 1,000
Normal: 1,000 5,000
The Orcs of Thar
Orcish witches and shamans have very limited abilities when it comes to creating magical items. They prefer sending a few hordes of bloodthirsty warriors to steal them from whoever has some. However, they can create amulets for themselves or others. Special components are required to create these amulets. These items have limited powers as described below.

^ Roll ^ Amulet Power |
| 01-09 | +1 bonus to attack rolls |

Palm Sign
**XP Value:** 500 **GP Value:** 2,500
Oasis of the White Palm
The palm sign is a symbol that magically appears on the palm of the woman chosen by fate to be the bride of the sheik of the oasis. The mark also appears on the palm of the woman betrothed to the sheik’s firstborn son. The sheik and his son each wear the amulet. The origins of the amulet and the pai/m mark were lost in antiquity and no one now knows their true purpose.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Martek, after his visions of the future, gave the palm sign and the amulet to the ancient leader of the Symbayans. They were to be handed down through the ages until the time when the two would be combined to tell where and how to release the djinni.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Anyone who puts the amulet against the palm symbol is able to align the symbols and read clearly:</wrap>\\
<wrap centeralign>//City of Phoenix over the house of Set where sleeps salvation—There speak Atmopryeetno!//</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The message can be read only when the palm mark and the //palm sign amulet// are aligned together. “Atmopryeetno” is the word that releases the Djinni at the ancient (and now destroyed) City of Phoenix.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The amulet itself is a weapon. It glows in the presence of efreeti, and strikes them with a beam of cold, blue light. The pain caused by the beam drives efreeti away in three rounds. The amulet also acts as a //ring of fire resistance//. The amulet loses its powers once it is used to free the djinni.</wrap>

of the Papyrus Scepter
**XP Value:** 600 **GP Value:** 9,000
IMAGINE Magazine 16
This amulet is a sheaf of papyrus leaves and gives the deceased renewed vigor and youth for their journey to the afterlife. It is placed on the chest on the day of the funeral.\\
<wrap indent>For the living, the amulet raises one score—Dexterity, Strength, or Constitution—of any user one point (to a maximum of 18). If the Strength of a warrior is 18, a user can raise his or her exceptional Strength on a 1d20 roll.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Alternately, the user can choose to retrograde the aging process. If this option is selected, the character’s age is reduced by one year every year for 1d6+4 years. Once this 1d6+4 year time period is complete, the character begins to age again normally, beginning at the new, younger age. This amulet can be used once.</wrap>

of Perpetual Youth
**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 20,000
Tome of Magic
This amulet glows with a faint, blue light. The wearer has temporary immunity to the effects of both natural and magical aging; the amulet grows older instead of the wearer. As the amulet ages, it gradually becomes dimmer, It can absorb 5d6 years of aging, at which time its light dims completely, its magic negated, and the wearer resumes normal aging.

of Perpetual Youth
and Inexperience
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** 2,000
1992 Fantasy Collector Card 624
This amulet glows continuously with a faint, blue light and conveys immunity from aging for 5d6 years, just like an //amulet of perpetual youth//. Once donned, however, it cannot be removed without the aid of a //remove curse// spell or similar magical means until its magic has expired. Furthermore. the wearer cannot accumulate any experience points until the amulet is removed. A PC wearing this amulet should not be advised of this by the DM until the curse is broken—the character should continue to believe that experience points are being accumulated (unless attempting to advance while wearing the cursed item).

Phelthong’s

Menzoberranzan Campaign Set

Named for the drow wizard of fabled powers who devised them long ago, these rare, fist-sized obsidian pendants are carved into smiling drow faces. In Menzoberranzan, they are worn only by powerful Master Mages of Sorcere. These amulets have the following powers (identical to the cited spells):
* //Comprehend languages// whenever held or worn.
* //Dimension door// twice per day, by silent command of the bearer. Use of this power extinguishes any fires within 30 feet in the round of its activation by will.
* //Obscurement// once per day, activated by the bearer’s will.

This device enables the individual possessing it to transport instantly to or from any one of the closest levels of the Outer Planes. The journey is absolutely safe, if not absolutely sure, but until the individual learns the device, transport is random. Roll 1d6. On a 4-6, add 12 to the result of a 1d12 roll (for a result between | and 24). Ona 1-3 do not add 12 to a 1d12 roll.

of Power
**XP Value:** 12,000 **GP Value:** 60,000
DRAGON Magazine 5
Usable by all spellcasters, this object serves to periodically boost latent magical energy. One day each week, the number of spells (of each level) the caster may perform, and the range, duration, and power (dice, area, number affected, etc.) of those spells, is increased by 50%. An enchanter could, for example, do 643-1 spells on one day a week, rather than the usual 4-3--2-1. (Always round fractions down.) Due to the increase in spell capabilities, the target’s saving throw is augmented by +3.\\
<wrap indent>Upon acquiring the //amulet of power//, a new user must wear it for 30 consecutive days before it melds properly to his or her mental capacities, After that period, the amulet becomes fully functional. Any attempts to make use of the power boost before the 30-day period is completed are all in vain.</wrap>

of Proof Against Detection and Location
**XP Value:** 4,000 **GP Value:** 15,000
DUNGEON MASTER Guide, 1st Edition
This device protects the wearer against all divination and magical location and detection. The wearer cannot be detected through //clairaudience//, //clairvoyance//, //ESP//, //telepathy//, //crystal balls//, or any other scrying devices. No aura is discernible, and predictions cannot be made regarding the user unless a very powerful being is consulted.

Drums on Fire Mountain
This amulet, in the form of a distorted boar’s head on a fine gold chain, has been specially enchanted by KalnaKaa. It has the properties of a //ring of protection +3//, but it also protects any lycanthrope wearing it from the effects of wolfsbane. KalnaKaa can wear it in both pig and human form.

of Protection from Alignment Change
**XP Value:** 3,000 **GP Value:** 30,000
Old Empires
This magical talisman has a ruby as its centerpiece. The amulet protects the wearer against the effects of magic designed to fundamentally alter a person’s alignment. While this does not protect characters from spells that //charm// them into actions that they wouldn’t normally perform, it does prevent the effects of a //helm of opposite alignment// and similar items. It cannot stop the alignment reversal process of an artifact or relic, but (DM’s option) it may slow it down.

of Protection from Crystal Balls and ESP
**XP Value:** 4,000 **GP Value:** 15,000
Dunceons & Dracons Rules Cyclopedia
The wearer of this item is protected from being spied upon with //crystal balls// and any type of //ESP//.

of Protection from Good
**XP Value:** 600 **GP Value:** 3,000
DUNGEON Magazine 11
This item is worn by all temple guards and priests of evil deities. The amulets are created by a special process known only to higher-level priests. Each amulet, shaped like a distorted skull, is worn in plain view and serves as an //unholy symbol//. A +2 bonus is given to the wearer’s Armor Class as long as the wearer remains evil, and a +1 attack bonus is applied when fighting good-aligned creatures.

of Protection from Sleep
**XP Value:** 500 **GP Value:** 2,000
DRAGON Magazine 9]
When worn on a chain or on a cord around the
neck, this object prevents its wearer from falling
asleep, cither natural or induced, magical sleep.
The wearer is always alert under its influence,
and cannot be affected by //sleep// spells, potions, or
poisons that cause sleep, nor the sleep gaze of a
jackalwere, or any other item or procedure that
causes sleep or drowsiness.

The //amulet of protection from sleep// can be
worn as long as desired. However, after three
days of continuous use, the wearer begins to have
mild and infrequent hallucinations. These effects
increase in frequency and intensity each day after
that. After seven straight days of sleeplessness,
the user is afflicted by a form of insanity, deter-
mined by a roll of 1d6:

{|
! **Roll** 
! **Induced Dementia** 
|-
| 1 
| **Dementia Praecox:** The afflicted character is quite uninterested in any undertaking when suffering from this form of madness. Nothing seems worthwhile, and the individual is filled with lassitude and a tremendous feeling of ennui. No matter how important the situation, it is 25% likely that the distressed character chooses to ignore it as meaningless.
|-
| 2 
| **Delusional Insanity:** Similar to megalomania, in this state, the deluded person is convinced that he or she is a famous figure—a monarch, demigod, or similar personage. Those who fail to recognize the true nature of the afflicted arouse great hostility. In normal affairs, the individual seems sane, but acts in a manner appropriate to a station that he or she does not actually hold, gives orders to actual or imagined creatures, and draws upon monies or items that do not exist.
|-
| 3 
| **Schizophrenia:** This form of insanity strikes suddenly and violently (1 in 6 chance per turn, lasting 2d6 turns, then 1 in 6 chance per turn to return to normal). The afflicted can become hysterical, enraged, or completely maniacal. The insane character shrieks, raves, and behaves in a violent manner, possessing 18/50, 18/75, or 18/00 Strength according to the state he or she is in. 
{|
! **Roll** 
! **State Strength** 
|-
| 1-2 
| Hysteria 18<sup>50</sup>
|-
| 3-4 
| Enragement 18<sup>75</sup>
|-
| 5-6 
| Mania 18<sup>00</sup> 
|}
|-
| 4 
| **Paranoia:** At the onset of this derangement, the beset individual becomes convinced that “they” are plotting against him or her, spying, listening, and always nearby. As the affliction develops over several days, the tormented character becomes convinced that everyone is part of the plot. Conversations are about the paranoid character, laughter is directed at him or her, and every action of former friends is aimed at deluding the afflicted to fulfill the “plot.” The paranoid is principally concerned about social positions or goods first, but as the ailment progresses, he or she “realizes” that the plotters are actually after his or her life. A paranoid displays signs of increasing suspicion, taking elaborate precautions with locks, guards, devices, and food and drink. In the later stages of paranoia, the victim exhibits extremely irrational behavior, may hire assassins to do away with “plotters,” or even become homicidal in order to protect his or her life. Paranoids trust absolutely no one when the affliction is in the advanced stage, regarding their former close associates and friends as their worst enemies.
|-
| 5-6 
| **Hallucinatory insanity:** This malady causes the sufferer to see, hear, and otherwise sense things that do not exist. The more exciting or stressful a given situation, the more likely the individual is to hallucinate. Common delusions are: ordinary objects that do not exist, people nearby or passing when there are no people, voices giving information or instructions, abilities or forms that the character does not really possess (Strength, wings, gills, etc.), threatening creatures appearing from nowhere, etc. It is 50% likely that the afflicted individual behaves normally until stimulated or under stress. Hallucinations commence and continue for 1d20 turns after the excitement or stress passes.
|}

(Note that even nonfighters can possess exceptional Strength during this state, as can nonhuman races.) The lunatic is unreasonable when spoken to, but he or she possesses great cunning. The afflicted person seeks to either avoid conflict or to do something (not necessarily the appropriate something) about the situation at hand. When the madness has passed, the afflicted one does not remember his or her actions while mad, believing that he or she is sane.

<wrap indent>The hallucinations stop immediately if the amulet is taken off before seven straight days of use, but if the wearer is stricken by insanity, this condition persists until removed by a //heal//, //restoration//, or //wish// spell, or by similar magic. If the amulet is worn for 10 consecutive days, the wearer dies when the 10th day has passed. No magical cures can offset this effect, and the character can only be brought back to life by a //raise dead//, r//esurrection//, or //wish// spell. The amulet does not provide a substitute for sleep, it merely postpones the need for it. A character who goes without sleep by using the amulet eventually has to make up for this deficiency.</warp>\\
<wrap indent>To make up lost sleep, a character only needs to sleep one half-hour for each hour of lost slumber. This does not apply when the deficit is a full night’s sleep (8 hours or less); in that case, lost sleep must be made up on an hour-for-hour basis. The wearer of the amulet is not penalized for lack of sleep (except by the side effects described above). Lost hit points are regained at the normal rate, and a spellcaster’s ability to study and memorize spells is not impaired by lack of sleep as long as the amulet is worn.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The amulet can be removed at any time, either by the wearer or someone else. If the wearer has lost 16 hours (two nights) of sleep or less when the amulet is //removed//, he or she is able to remain awake for up to one hour, if engaged in fairly strenuous physical activity. (No one drops off to sleep in front of an onrushing dragon, for instance.) If the amulet has been used to postpone sleep for longer than two nights, the wearer immediately falls asleep when the amulet is removed, and cannot be awakened by normal means for 1-6 hours thereafter. A //haste// or similar spell can restore the character to consciousness (but not provide any //hasting// effects) for the duration of the spell. Until a character has made up all lost sleep, he or she fights at -1 to attack rolls for every 8 hours of sleep (or any portion of that) that have not been made up. The amulet may be worn by any character class, and functions indefinitely without need for recharging.</wrap>

Amulet of Psionic Interference
of Psionic Interference
**XP Value:** 5,000 **GP Value:** 7,500
Dark SUN Campaign Set
This item scrambles the wearer’s psionic abilities,
rendering the user incapable of making any
psionic power checks. The device creates a magi-
cal field around the wearer’s mind that does not
eliminate Psionic Strength Points, but interferes
with them so that they cannot be called upon for
power checks. The amulet does not interfere with
the wearer’s ability to recover psionic strength
points. Only the person who places the amulet
can remove it. If someone puts it on, he or she
can easily remove it, but if it was placed there by
another, it cannot be removed without a //remove
curse// or //wish// spell.

of Psionic Reflection
**XP Value:** 2,500 **GP Value:** 10,000
DRAGON Magazine 99
The ancient githyanki/mind flayer wars spawned a number of interesting, psionically related magical items and weapons. Among them is the githyanki //amulet of psionic reflection//, a small, ornate device that is pinned to a headband and placed so that it is centered on the user’s forehead. The wearer is protected from all Psionic Blast attacks; the protection does not extend to anyone else. In addition, if a Psionic Blast is cast upon the person wearing this amulet, the amulet itself generates a Psionic Blast in the direction of the attacker, at 4 the strength of the original attack (round fractions down), If the wearer is psionic, he or she cannot fire a Psionic Blast without being destroyed.\\
<wrap indent>This device is generally used by githyanki scouts operating alone on missions into illithid lairs. Wearing these amulets is considered a great honor, and githyanki go to great lengths to recover lost amulets. Mind flayers are equally enraged to see such an amulet if they recognize it for what it is. Only humans, githyanki, and githzerai may use this item; psionic demihumans and nonpsionic characters are neither aided nor injured by it.</wrap>

of Psychic Protection
**XP Value:** 3,000 **GP Value:** 15,000
D&D Expert Rules Set
This amulet is good against both //crystal balls// and //ESP//. The wearer of this item is automatically protected from spying by anyone using a //crystal ball// or any type of //ESP//.

of Recall

Ghost Tower of Inverness
The //amulet of recall// can //teleport// or //plane shift// its user (and anyone touching the user) and all carried gear, to its symbiont point. The amulet’s symbiont point is the last location in which it lay, untouched by any living creature, for 30 days or more.

Shakti
**XP Value:** 6,000 **GP Value:** 60,000
DUNGEON Magazine 45
When called to battle, Cosette uses a small figurine at her belt called a //shakti//. When she speaks the command word, the //shakti// surrounds her in scintillating blue-green armor (AC 0) and arms her with two //short swords +1// that give off electrical discharges when they hit an opponent (2d6+1 hp damage) on an attack roll of 20.

Shell of Protection from Sharks
**XP Value:** 600 **GP Value:** 3,000
Otherlands
This amulet is always in the form of a beautifully polished seashell half. When worn around the neck, it creates a //circle of protection// with a 10-foot radius around the owner. Sharks cannot penetrate the circle, but the protection is forfeited if the user attacks.

Shield
**XP Value:** 750 **GP Value:** 7,500
POLYHEDRON Newszine 67
These small amulets of carved stone contain up to 24 charges. After uttering the command word (usually inscribed on the amulet), the wearer is protected with a //shield// spell, cast at the 12th level with a duration of six turns. Each use expends one charge, and the item cannot be recharged.

of Sleeplessness
**XP Value:** -- **GP Value:** 1,000
DRAGON Magazine 91
This magic item is the same as the //amulet of protection from sleep//. When worn, it performs all of the same functions, with all of the same restrictions and dangers. However, it cannot be removed from the wearer’s neck by anything less than a //limited wish// or //alter reality// spell.

of Spinecastle
**XP Value:** 900 **GP Value:** 4,500
GREYHAWK Adventures
The wizards of the Kingdom of Aerdy created this amulet to aid in the war against the northern barbarians. After the fall of Spinecastle, the amulet disappeared. Scholars assumed it didn’t survive the wrath of the barbarians, but stories of the amulet’s use still surface in the Bone March.\\
<wrap indent>Once per hour this golden amulet can be commanded to radiate a magical aura in a 30-foot radius for one turn. The aura has negative effects on all northern barbarians, raising their superstitious fears and generating hatred for magic. Those of the 1st to 4th level must save vs. spell or immediately retreat out of the area of effect for 1d8 turns. Those of the 5th to 7th level must save vs. spell or be stunned for one round. Those of higher level suffer a -1 on their attack rolls.</wrap>

of the Spirit
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 5,000
Fate of Istus
This item is a small gold disk on a thin chain. The use of //detect magic// and similar spells indicate a strong dweomer, but won’t give any idea of exactly what the amulet’s powers are. Anyone wearing the amulet is immune to magic and attacks that directly affect the soul or spirit (Like //trap the soul//, //magic jar//, a ghost attack, or possession). The amulet also provides a 25% magic resistance against //ESP// and //telepathy// that cannot be waived.\\
<wrap indent>If the wearer dies while wearing the amulet, his essence is held in stasis until freed. While in stasis, the essence cannot progress to any other plane of existence that may be waiting for it; the person cannot be //raised//, //resurrected// or //reincarnated//; and //speak with dead// and similar spells won’t work at all. To free the essence, the amulet must be removed from contact with the body, then the spells bless, //protection from evil//, and //chant// must be cast over the body.</wrap>

Thet of Ptah
**XP Value:** **GP Value:** —
Gods, Demigods, & Heroes
Ptah enjoys new ideas and devices. When a being creates a device that is highly useful (DM’s option), there is a 10% chance that the deity will reward that being with a //thet//. This device is an amulet geared to do one of two things—either project an antimagic shell around the user that does not affect the user’s ability to cast spells, or allow the wearer to go ethereal once a week.

of Timekeeping
**XP Value:** 100 **GP Value:** 500
The Book of Marvelous Magic
This simple hexagonal medallion is inscribed with three lines connecting the points and crossing in the center. Upon command, the six sections of the amulet slowly turn color, one at a time. Each color shift is gradual, taking one turn. When the last section completes its color shift, exactly one hour after the command, the entire medallion returns to its original color and resumes the process. It stops keeping time on command of the user. The amulet functions only on the Prime Material Plane and stops in mid-change if taken to another plane.

of Transformation
**XP Value:** 350 **GP Value:** 3,500
DRAGON Magazine 187
These amulets, carved from oak bark, are hung around the neck by cords of woven mistletoe. Each amulet enables a druid to transform into a specific animal—mammal, bird, reptile, amphibian, fish, or insect. This //transformation// is like the transformation ability druids acquire at the 7th level, except that it does not heal hit point damage and a druid using such an amulet radiates faintly of alteration magic when transformed. To activate an amulet, a druid must be wearing it and must speak a command word. Only one amulet may be worn at a time, and the druid must //polymorph// to human form before using the 7th-level transformation ability. Druids may use each amulet in their possession once per day.\\
<wrap indent>//Amulets of transformation// are generally found in groups of two to five. Mammal and bird forms are common; the other forms are rare, as are the forms of animals larger than a black bear or smaller than a toad, Note that two druids who use the same amulet on different occasions appear identical once //transformed//. The amulet allows transformation into a particular creature recognizable by druids, rangers, and members of the same creature species. When the //transformation// occurs, the animal form is visibly as healthy as the druid’s form was before the //transformation//. If a druid dies in animal form, he or she reverts to original form and the amulet crumbles into dust.</wrap>

Two Fingers
**XP Value:** 1,400 **GP Value:** 14,000
IMAGINE Magazine 16
This amulet was intended to represent the two fingers of Horus, the god of the sky. He used them to help his father Osiris, the god of the Underworld, up the ladder and into the heavens. It is often found on the interior of mummy casks; it is usually made of obsidian or hematite.\\
<wrap indent>The amulet allows its living user to create a ladder that magically extends as far as 100 feet. The ladder can be used at any angle (even horizontally), extending from the character’s feet as far as needed. The ladder can hold up to 1,000 pounds. If more than 1,000 Ibs. is applied to the ladder, it immediately converts back into an amulet. The amulet can be used once per day.</wrap>

of Undersea Friendship
**XP Value:** 800 **GP Value:** 4,000
Nightwatch in the Living City
This powerful medallion was created by the Locathah for diplomatic negotiations between underwater races, It works as a //friendship// spell, with //permanency// cast on it. If worn by a water breather it makes all creatures perceive the wearer as a friend. The amulet works only on races born to be water breathers, and drives non-water breathers insane within hours. The insanity manifests itself as an obsession to attack all those nearby. It causes the wearer to think all other beings are fish-headed humanoids. A //remove curse// spell is required for land-based creatures to remove the item from another’s body.

of Vadarin
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** 2,500
1992 Fantasy Collector Card 21
This amulet has been specifically created by Vadarin, psionically enhanced by him to provide the following powers—five times per day, the amulet issues a Psionic Blast as if the user’s power score were rolled and without consumption of the user’s Psionic Strength Points. The amulet also generates an Intellect Fortress at all times to a radius of 5 yards from the user, providing mental protection from psionic attack for anyone within range. This defense is made as if the user’s power score were rolled.

Vulture
**XP Value:** 700 **GP Value:** 1,200
IMAGINE Magazine 16
The //vulture amulet// was intended to cause the power of Isis as the Divine Mother to be a protection for the deceased. It is placed upon the body on the day of the funeral while the activation word is recited over it.\\
<wrap indent>When this amulet is placed on a dead body for one full day, the deceased can never be turned into an undead creature, The amulet can be used once per week.</wrap>

of Weakening
**XP Value:** 5,000 **GP Value:** 25,000
The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan
This amulet makes all foes within a 30-foot radius feel weak and ineffective. The closer a character gets to the amulet, the weaker he or she becomes. For every 5 feet of approach within the 30-foot radius, the victim (temporarily) loses one point of Strength. This amulet does not affect the wearer, although the user’s companions (if within range of the effect) are affected.

==== Anchor ====
An anchor holds a vessel in place. A ship’s anchor is the most familiar sort, consisting of a straight central bar (the shank), an upper crosspiece (the stock), and two curved lower arms (the crown) having widened ends (the flukes). Attached to a chain or rope (the cable), it is tightly secured to the ship. The depth of the water can be determined, if desired, by marks on the chain or rope once the anchor rests on the bottom. Most ordinary anchors are made of iron, though other materials, usually metal, may be used. A magical anchor may be of any size or material, but always shaped like a ship’s anchor. Roll on the table below to determine the type.

^ Roll ^ Anchor Type |
| 01-70 | Anchor |
| 71-80 | Anjar |
| 81-90 | Bawara |
| 91-00 | Sinn |

Aerial
**XP Value:** 3,000 **GP Value:** 22,500
The Book of Marvelous Magic
This 3-inch-long, miniature golden anchor needs only a thread or string as a cable. When dropped from any flying device or creature, it keeps the creature or object steady at a point in the air, despite air movements or storms of any kind. It can also be thrown upward and commanded to secure itself where it stops, and cannot be moved until the command to release is given. Normal thread or string used as its cable supports up to 3,000 pounds of weight for as long as the user can hold on (approximately one hour per point of Strength).

Aerial II
**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 18,000
Champions of MYSTARA™
This 3-inch-long, miniature golden anchor also uses a thread or string for a cable. When dropped from a flying device or creature, it maintains its burden, fixed at that point in the air, regardless of air movements or storms. The only danger is that the thread might break. For every five tons of ship’s tonnage, there is a 5% chance the thread or string breaks in any wind stronger than a light breeze. Double the chance of breakage for normal winds; triple it for high winds.\\
<wrap indent>Some aerial anchors come equipped with a magical cable. This anchors any skyship in anything less than high winds. In high winds or a storm, however, the cable has a 5% chance of breaking per every 50 tons of ship’s Tonnage.</wrap>

Fishing
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** 5,000
The Book of Marvelous Magic
A fishing anchor functions as a //seafaring anchor//. However, once dropped in a sea or ocean, there is a 25% chance per use of attracting a sea serpent or sperm whale. If so, the creature swallows the anchor and attempts to leave. A lesser sea serpent can tow a vessel having 25 hull points or less; a greater sea serpent can tow a vessel having up to 75 hull points; and a sperm whale, a vessel up to 150 hull points. Towing speed is half normal swimming speed for the monster. If the creature hooked cannot tow the vessel, it surfaces and attacks. Once a creature swallows it, the anchor is no longer able to hoist itself. In this event its cable can be cut and the anchor lost, or a party can be sent underwater to deal with the monster and retrieve the anchor.

Hold Fast
**XP Value:** 800 **GP Value:** 4,000
POLYHEDRON Newszine 79
This magical item fashioned of silver and iron weighs only 3 pounds. When the command words “hold fast” are spoken and the anchor is tossed over the side of a ship, it magically imbeds itself in the sea floor and holds any vessel weighing up to 20 tons. Even the worst storms cannot affect the anchor’s ability to //hold fast//.\\
<wrap indent>The anchor holds a ship with a thin, invisible rope 300 feet long. If the rope is cut, both the rope and the anchor lose all magical properties. The anchor rope is treated as AC 0 and is impervious to all damage save that from edged weapons; 30 points of damage must be delivered in one round to sever the rope. The anchor cannot hold ships that try to anchor in water deeper than 300 feet or weighing more than 20 tons.</wrap>

Man
**XP Value:** 3,000 **GP Value:** 22,500
The Book of Marvelous Magic
This item appears and functions as a //seafaring anchor// in all respects. However, it may also be commanded to //animate//. This means the anchor’s stock grows arms with clawed hands (#AT 2, Dmg 1d6 each) and the crown becomes a set of moving legs that generate flukes for fins and can swim (60 feet per round). The anchor can be animated only when it is touching salt water, It is neither intelligent nor alive, and immune to most spells; its iron body (AC 0; 50 hp) is not easily damaged. The //anchor man// can stand watch, but communicates only by tugging on the cable—once for sighting humanoids, twice for dangerous or very large fish, and three times for other monstrous forms. It defends itself only if attacked. It returns to the ship if reduced to 10 hit points or less, if commanded to hoist itself, or returns if it has been ordered previously to return instead of signaling. The //anchor man// disintegrates if slain, and when removed from the water turns back into an ordinary, inanimate anchor. It may be //animated// once per day.

Seafaring
**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 15,000
The Book of Marvelous Magic
This anchor is 2 feet long and weighs 100 pounds. When commanded, it magically lengthens its cable either to any named length or until the anchor touches bottom; the cable’s maximum length is one mile. It also shortens its cable on command and requires no capstan (cable winch).

of Staying
**XP Value** **GP Value**
Cursed: — 2,000
Greater: 500 5,000
Lesser: 300 3,000
War Captain’s Companion
This item appears as a standard anchor, except for the faint magical aura radiating from the anchor and its chain. When pitched over the side of a ship moving at tactical speed, the anchor comes to rest on the gravity plane, stopping the ship (reduces SR to 0). The ship becomes stationary with respect to the closest Class A or greater celestial body. When the anchor is pulled up, the ship can move once again.\\
<wrap indent>The anchor can be dropped while moving at spelljamming speed, but with dire consequences. The ship instantly stops, while everything in the ship tries to continue forward. All crew members suffer 3d10 points of damage (save vs. spell for half damage). Unsecured items must roll a save vs. falling or be broken. Typical anchor variations include:</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>//Lesser anchor of staying:// This item gives off a faint auburn aura when cast over the side. It can stop a ship powered by a minor helm, but its dweomer is not sufficient to halt a ship with a major helm. A ship with a major helm or equivalent is only slowed by 3 SR (to a minimum of SR 1).</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>//Greater anchor of staying:// This item gives off a faint bluish aura when cast over the side. It can be used on any spelljamming ship. Its dweomer is sufficient to stop a ship powered by the equivalent of a major helm.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>//Cursed anchor:// While all tests and divinations show this item to be a //greater anchor of staying//, when activated it moves the ship toward the nearest body greater than 10 tons at an SR of one. The motion is at first so subtle it is virtually undetectable; except for the fact that a planet or ship can be seen (eventually) moving toward the ship. The ship gradually accelerates to spelljamming speed. If the anchor has been in place for 24 continuous hours, it cannot be pulled in. Only by the use of a //remove curse// on the item itself, can the cursed anchor be brought back into the ship, and the motion stopped. After 24 hours under the effects of the cursed anchor, a spelljamming helm ceases to function.</wrap>

of Weight

The Book of Marvelous Magic
This item is identical to an //aerial anchor//. However, there is a 50% chance that suddenly, magically, it weighs 2,000 pounds, dragging the user down. The victim can stop the plunge by cutting the cable immediately or by snapping it, determined by a standard “open doors” roll. If the cable is severed, the //anchor of weight// vanishes upon hitting the ground.

==== Ankh ====
Ankhs are tau crosses with a loop at the top. They are generally used as a symbol of endurance, continuation, and creation—all symbols of life. Originally an Egyptian symbol, ankhs have found popularity among the northern cultures. Often the tau itself can be found without the rounded or looped top, but these are considered cruciforms.

This powerful symbol of divinity was lost millennia ago in the Orcgate Wars. It was the holy symbol of the manifestation of Re. It is a worn and dirty rod of birchwood, without any ornamentation, 1-foot-long, in the shape of an ankh.\\
<wrap indent>It has the following powers: //continual light// (at will), //destroy undead// 30' radius (3/day), //regenerate// (3/day), //restoration// (3/day), //resurrection// (2/day).</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The //destroy undead// power slays all undead of less than 7 HD (or levels), and inflicts 12d8 points of damage (no saving throw) on all undead of 7 Hit Dice or higher.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>If used by a mortal, the ankh drains one level of experience each time a power is used (and only a //wish// directly granted from a deity can restore the lost level).</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>This relic is sought after by the priests of Horus, Ra, and Osiris, as they wish to place it with the mummified body of the manifestation of Ra in the Tower of Eternity in Skuld. Anyone who presents it to an incarnation or manifestation of either god will be richly rewarded.</wrap>

This magical device, carried by all of the gods of the Nile at one time or another, enables them to raise any dead creature (as the spell) as long as all of the body parts are present at the time of the raising. The device kills by fire any nondivine being that touches it. It is about 1-foot long, shaped like a cross with a loop on the top. It is usually bright blue in color. There are only seven of these in any given plane at any one time. Non-magical ankhs are used as holy symbols by many priests of Egyptian deities.

==== Anklet ====
A strip of leather or metal with a hasp on each end, this jewelry is usually ornate, adorned with gems. In use, it is fastened around the ankle. It //does not// function if fastened to any other part of the body and cannot be used by a legless creature. Anklets may be found singly or in pairs, but a pair found together need not match. Any magical anklet has two command words—one to lock, and one to unlock. When locked, an anklet cannot be opened except by destruction, by command, by a //remove curse// applied by a 15th- or higher-level caster, or by a //dispel magic// spell, the anklet treated as 30th level. A magical anklet cannot be damaged by force, even by magical weapons, but may be destroyed by dragon breath or by damage causing spells. Each anklet can withstand 20 points of damage. An anklet cannot be placed on an unwilling victim unless the creature is paralyzed, unconscious, or dead.

Equus
**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 8,000
DUNGEON Magazine 22
An //equus// is a magical piece of jewelry that, upon command, //polymorphs// into some form of a beast of burden. The word “equus” (plural “equi”) comes from an ancient language and has no literal translation in the common tongue. The closest translation is “beast of burden” or “horse,” but the word can be applied to anything that is used like a horse. Thus, an actual horse, mule, worg, camel, dog-sled team, nightmare, or any other creature that can be ridden, used to pull a load, or carry goods can be termed an //equus//. //Equi// come in many different varieties, with the most common listed below. While 80% of equi are either good or neutrally aligned, 20% //polymorph// into evil creatures such as nightmares, worgs, and giant spiders. It is said that the death knight Shan Nikkoleth once possessed an //equus// that //polymorphed// into gorgon form.\\
<wrap indent>The anklets are invariably made of silver, one side engraved with the image of the creature it becomes and the reverse etched with the command word.</wrap>

===== Creature List =====
The DM may choose the form of the creature into
which the //equus polymorphs// from the following
table. The jewelry form //polymorphs// into one type
of creature only. A DM who prefers to roll ran-
domly should add the roll of 1d8 to that of 1d12
and consult the table below. The DM should use
only a creature he or she feels comfortable with
and is sure will not give the PC an unfair advan-
tage in the campaign. Different creatures can be
added to or deleted from the list as the DM sees
fit. Any of the following creatures that do not
appear on **Table 49** in the //PHB// should be consid-
ered equal to a heavy horse in movement rate and
encumbrance.

If an //equus// is slain (reduced to 0 hit points or
fewer) in creature form, the creature immedi-
ately reverts to anklet form and cannot change
into a creature again. Damage to the creature
form of the //equus// can be healed magically by
//cure wounds// spells. If the creature is allowed
food and rest, it heals naturally at the rate of
one hit point per day. However, the //equus// can
neither heal itself nor be healed while in anklet
form.

The Book of Marvelous Magic
This anklet appears and functions as an //anklet of levitation// in all respects. However, it also causes the wearer’s leg to grow at the rate of | inch per turn (or part of a turn) for as long as it is worn. The victim’s Dexterity score drops by 2 points per foot (two hours) of growth: if two anklets are worn, both legs grow evenly, and Dexterity drops by only one point per foot of growth. The anklet may be removed by the usual methods. The magical growth and loss of Dexterity can be negated only by a //remove curse// cast caster of at least 26th level or by a //wish//. Although either remedy instantly restores the victim to normal size and Dexterity, the anklets, wherever they are, disintegrate.

When locked on an ankle, this item causes the victim to move at ‘4 normal rate. If two are used, only ½ normal rate is possible.

of Levitation
**XP Value:** 2,500 **GP Value:** 17,000
The Book of Marvelous Magic
This item can be locked and commanded to rise. It stops and goes upon command of the person who locked it. If one anklet is used, the wearer is hoisted by one leg, in a most inconvenient posture; if two are used, normal //levitation// is obtained. It is controlled within a range of 60 feet, but the effect is otherwise identical to the wizards’ spell //levitate//, bestowing vertical movement at the rate of 20 feet per round. The victim cannot be “dropped” unless the anklet is suddenly unlocked or destroyed.

of Sinking
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** 600
The Book of Marvelous Magic
This anklet appears and functions as an //anklet of walking// in all respects. However, when used to walk on acid, or on water more than 30 feet deep, the anklet stops functioning at some inconvenient point, suddenly becoming as heavy as a 100—pound weight (per anklet). When the malfunction occurs, the anklet also negates all other //water walking// spells and effects. The wearer sinks like a stone until the anklet is removed, although //feather fall// or other spell effects may slow the victim for a time.

of Sure Footing

POLYHEDRON Newszine 90
It is popularly believed by most sages that the wizard who invented these items served on a pirate ship based in the Corsair Domains. Legend has it that the wizard did not adapt well to life at sea; the ship’s pitching and rolling as it rode the waves made it impossible for the wizard to cast spells. After months of research, he enchanted a pair of anklets that would make his life at sea easier. The anklets were woven from kelp, and the wizard dubbed them //anklets of sure footing//.\\
<wrap indent>Both anklets must be worn, and they do not function if covered by footwear or cloth. The wearer is never affected by seasickness and can move at normal speeds across ship decks, even under treacherous conditions such as mountainous waves and gale force winds. Spellcasting is not hampered by the ship’s movement, because the anklets ensure the caster’s steadiness.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>In addition, the wearer can climb rigging as easily as walk, and fight and cast spells from the rigging as if standing on solid ground.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Although the anklets can be worn by any race and class, they are highly sought after by seafar- ing rogues and spellcasters.</wrap>

of Walking
**XP Value:** 1,200 **GP Value:** 6,000

When locked, this anklet enables the wearer to walk upon any fluid, water, oil, acid, etc., without actually touching it. Feet or boots hover a fraction of an inch above the fluid. One anklet can support 200 pounds in weight; two support 500 pounds.

===== Antennae of Triangulation =====
**XP Value:** -- **GP Value:** 55,000
Realmspace
These antennae are usually over 8 feet in width and can be 20 feet or more in length. They appear to be antennae removed from some gargantuan insect. There is a helmet of liaison that accompanies the antennae when it is first purchased— assuming one is for sale—that links the antennae and the wearer of the helmet. The helmet relays the information found by the antennae in exact detail to the wearer. When the helmet is put on, the wearer immediately gets a complete picture of the space around him. The operator sees everything in a 360-degree, 10,000 yard sphere. Every little detail can be viewed mentally. The positioning of these items changes whenever the ship’s heading changes, or if the objects in sight change. These antennae make it impossible for anyone to surprise the ship, as long as someone is wearing the helmet. The antennae can be used to tell the wearer where an approaching spelljamming ship or an asteroid is in relation to the vessel’s current location. The items, having no charges, can be used an unlimited number of times.

===== Anvil =====
An anvil is a heavy iron block that has a flat top and a round, horn-shaped end. Blacksmiths heat metals until they soften, and use the anvil’s surface to hammer the metal into the desired shape. Magical anvils, however, can be of any size, shape, or weight, and they are commonly used to perform functions other than those performed by their nonmagical counterparts.

High Anvil of the Dwarves
**XP Value:** 5,000 **GP Value:** 50,000
DRAGON Magazine 58
The skill of dwarf metalcrafters is legendary, and through the ages they have continued to find ways of improving their smithing abilities. At some time within the last several centuries, dwarves learned how to create a magical device that would make them even more skilled as armorers, weapon makers, and smiths. The great cost of creating a //high anvil//, however, has kept the number of these items down to a precious few. Only a very large enclave can afford to make one—//high anvils// are never found in the shops of dwarven armorers, weapon makers, or smiths located in cities and towns—the danger of theft is too great.\\
<wrap indent>//High anvils// are large, elaborately carved, and forged from an alloy of adamantite and steel. They radiate a faint aura of magic. The anvils weigh about 175 pounds and cannot be easily moved or carried, and are often fixed or welded to the floor of the main armory of dwarven colonies.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The workmanship involved in the forging and decoration of a //high anvil// represents the best that the dwarves of the clan can offer, frequently adorned with depictions of great events in the clan’s history. While dwarves hold their //high anvils// to be beyond price, a realistic appraisal of one’s worth would probably range from 30,000 to 60,000 gold pieces.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>When used for metalworking, a //high anvil// adds +50% to the skill level of dwarven armorers, and doubles their efficiency, effectively cutting armor construction time in half. Dwarven smiths using a //high anvil// have doubled efficiency when forging any item, and weapon makers may construct axes, swords, and the like at three times the normal rate, working them on a //high anvil//. Nondwarf characters or creatures who use a //high anvil// (a very rare event, since dwarves are extremely protective of their treasures) have +25% added to their skill as armorers but enjoy no other benefits.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The increase in skill level and decrease in construction time are not permanent and only apply when a high anvil is used. Mithral and adamantite alloys can be worked with greater ease on a //high anvil//, and anything forged on one is of the highest quality.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>A //high anvil// is created by a long and involved process of crafting and enchantment. The physical work upon the Anvil takes between 24 and 36 months, and can only begin after the members of the clan have taken 6d4 months to decide on the anvil’s shape, design, and decorations. Once the anvil has been forged, it must undergo a ritual blessing by the most powerful dwarven priest in the clan, and 4d4 other priestal assistants. (The main priest must be at least 6th level, and a member of the same clan as the dwarves who forged the anvil.) The blessing takes 1d4+4 days, and the clan’s patron deity is invoked during the final enchantments.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>//High anvils// are not commonly found in treasure hoards. One might be discovered in the ruins of a dwarven stronghold, but even if the clan had been destroyed or driven off, another clan would try to recover the anvil to keep it from falling into the hands of another race. Dwarves who do manage to gain possession of a //high anvil// (from nondwarves, of course, since dwarves do not steal from each other) gain 10,000 experience points; the award is half as great for nondwarves who come to own one.</wrap>

This is a great, black, iron anvil, embossed with runes of power in gold and brass. Any competent smith will find nonmagical tasks uncannily easy when using this anvil. Bent swords straighten with a single tap, having lost none of their strength; horse shoes are just the right size; and everything worked on this anvil has a little extra shine and a cleaner finish. In actual game terms, the smith works at six times the usual speed.\\
<wrap indent>The anvil is too massive to transport except with the most elaborate methods, and using it is hard work.

This blacksmith’s tool was enchanted in a shrine of Moradin, king of the dwarven gods. It allows a dwarven weaponsmith to create extremely strong and sharp blades. Each weapon takes twice as long to create, but, when finished, is either a normal weapon (on an unsuccessful proficiency check) or a weapon of fine quality (on a successful proficiency check). All weapons of fine quality created by this anvil are worth 100 times the cost of a normal weapon of the same type. It is rumored that this anvil forged legendary magical weapons for the dwarves.

===== Apparatus =====
“Apparatus” is an all-encompassing term used to describe a machine so complex, it is impossible to associate a name with its function. Other terms that could work as well are “magical machine,” “contraption,” or “mechanism.” Most apparati are too large to move or relocate due to the possibility of breakage.

The Apparatus
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** —
RAVENLOFT Campaign Set
This huge machine stands over 30 feet tall and it is 20 feet wide at the base. A glass globe, 15 feet high, rests upon a massive tripod made of wood and steel. The tripod lifts the globe over 15 feet from the floor. The globe encases a great, spinning ball of sulphur. A network of rings, made of cold—forged steel, tops the enormous glass sphere.\\
<wrap indent>Two smaller globes, each the height of a man, are suspended below the large one. The pair, linked by a narrow glass neck, looks like an hourglass on its side. A 3-foot-wide trap door opens from the bottom of each smaller globe. A steel, tubular arch links each smaller globe to the mother sphere above.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>A third, and still smaller series of globes rings the entire base of the tripod, linked together like a chain by thin glass tubes. A bewildering array of metal and glass—rods, wires, and plates—joins the circle of spheres to the two human-sized glass chambers.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Lightning energizes the apparatus. The steel rings on top focus electricity into the mother globe. To fully charge, the //apparatus// requires 12 lightning strikes within the span of three hours; over a longer period, the charge fades. The energy is converted into a magical force by the spinning ball of sulphur within the globe.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>This contraption can perform a number of monstrous and misguided tasks. The first is a “transpossession.” It can cause the exchange of minds, between two intelligent subjects—even an intelligent creature and a man. The subjects must stand in the formidable glass chambers. On the 12th lightning strike, the psyches of the two individuals are exchanged. All mental abilities go with the psyche, all physical abilities stay with the body. Both subjects fall unconscious for 1d3 turns, Any attempts to determine the alignment or true nature of a transpossessed subject fails. Spells such as //know alignment//, //detect evil// or //true seeing// act as if the subject had a truly neutral alignment.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The second function of this machine requires the //rod of Rastinon//. When the rod is placed in the glass tube connecting the two large chambers, a subject’s personality can be split in two. An intelligent subject must stand in one of the big globes. On the 12th lightning strike, the psyche splits. In a flash, a duplicate of the subject appears in the adjacent chamber. Physically, they are almost twins. Mentally, they are unique. As of this writing, the split has involved only good and evil, separating the dark side from the light. Other divisions may be possible.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The “dark side” is a being of such evil that Ravenloft’s dark powers envelop him or her, granting a lordship and a domain. They may also give great powers, and transform the character physically. The individual immediately seeks to destroy the other half, because only then is he or she secure.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>According to legend, the //apparatus// can also rejoin the psyches it has divided. Both halves must occupy the globes, with the //rod of Rastinon// in place. On the 12th strike, their psyches join, and the original subject is restored. Theoretically, two normal subjects—each unique and whole—might be forced to share one body through this process. The stronger body would harbor the two psyches, while the weaker body would become a withered, empty shell.</wrap>

Alchemist’s Apparatus
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** —
Book of Artifacts
The apparatus, or the alchemists apparatus as it is sometimes known, is best described from the notebooks of Meister Dettrick.

//The very sight of it [the Apparatus] inspired a terror within me, for its very shape spoke of the unholy researches that planned it. It filled Herr Gustav s great hall, o'er-reaching even the balconies that looked upon the floor below. The main part consisted of a great glass sphere of sulphurous fumes, madly churning as the lightning teased the steel receptors set atop it. The whole is supported in a tripod of oppressive wood and iron, beneath which were suspended two smaller globes, each the height of a man. Piping arced from these to the sulphurous orb. Ringing these were yet smaller orbs, interwoven by tubes through which flowed streams of noxious yellow gas. To my trepidation, Herr Gustav already stood among the wires and pipes of the platform, priming the foul device for the coming storm. Then I saw that each contained a beast—one a quivering fawn, the other a ravening dire wolf. “Behold the test!” he cried to me, frantic with his madness as he gestured to the orbs. From his robes he produced a crystal rod, no more than 2 feet long, that throbbed with crystal fire. “The rod!” he shouted above the enraged storm. “With the rod I shall...”\\
<wrap indent>No more of his madness could I bear, and so risking the fury of the elements I fled the sage’s halls, out into the night... .</wrap>//

<wrap indent>It is unclear whether the apparatus is a single device or a set of plans and concepts so infernal in their execution that the result is the diabolic machine known by that name. The doubt exists because several times this artifact is said to have been both invented and destroyed, and yet, somehow it seems to recreate itself elsewhere to once again wreak havoc upon those who experiment with it.<\wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The first known construction of the apparatus was by one known as the Alchemist of Mordentshire, sometimes confused with Count Strahd Von Zarovich, another player in this tale. The story is that the alchemist created the apparatus in order to divide a soul and purge it of evil or, as others maintain, to fuse his own incomplete soul with that of another. Whatever his goal, his ambitions became entangled in those of Strahd and led to disaster, destroying the apparatus and its maker.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The monstrous apparatus had more of a life than its maker, it seems, for it has reappeared in other lands, sometimes as it was and sometimes changed and improved. Thus it is that some sages maintain that the true artifact is not the apparatus itself but the supposed notebooks of the original alchemist, and that it is from these plans that the physical apparatus is built. No one, however, can ever testify to seeing a copy of these notes.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>One important feature of the apparatus is the //rod of Rastinon//. This magical item, although not an artifact in its own right, is vital to several of the apparatus’s powers. It must be set in place between the two chamber orbs and then powered by lightning—or so that is how the story goes.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The apparatus is a wonderful artifact with which to threaten PCs, because its powers of //transpossession// and //soul-splitting// strike at the very essence of the player character. The thought of having one’s mind and psyche transferred into that of an orc or, perhaps worse, a goat should be enough to rouse fear in the heart of any PC.</wrap>\\
</wrap indent>Since the apparatus is not small, portable, or even quick to use, any adventure involving it must have a strong villain, one who can trap the PCs and then operate the device. A strong villain needs strong ambitions, too. The goals of this villain are certainly more than just tormenting the PCs. They are only attacked because they are useful in some experiments or because they threaten, knowingly or not, greater plans.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Should the characters manage to avoid the threats posed by the apparatus, they may still have problems. Friends and allies may suddenly become enemies through //transpossession//. Innocents may need to be restored or //transpossessed// spies ferreted out. This might require that the characters to seize and operate the apparatus, all at great peril to themselves!</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Among all of the artifacts, this apparatus is the easiest to remove from any campaign, for it has a history of overloading, exploding, and otherwise destroying itself. Whenever the device’s time has passed, it is a simple matter to demolish it in a dramatic stroke of lightning. Another apparatus, should it ever be needed, can always conveniently appear elsewhere, for like true science, once released from Pandora’s box, it can never be banished completely.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Unlike many other artifacts, the powers of the apparatus cannot be utilized at will. Although magical in nature, the device operates more like a machine. To run, it must be energized by lightning. No other electrical source can suffice, for the apparatus requires not only the voltage, but the elemental power that the lightning provides. The metal receptor plate in the top must be struck 12 times in the space of three hours for the device to build up the necessary charge. Only one charge can be held at a time and beyond the time limit, the stored energies fade. The charge is enough to feed a single power of the apparatus. Which power is used is determined by the operator, who must constantly supervise the machine’s operation. //Transpossession// can be used without additional preparation, but the remaining powers of the apparatus require the use of the //rod of Rastinon//, set in its place between the two globes.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>**Invoked Powers:** The simplest power is //transpossession//, the complete exchange of minds between two creatures. The subjects are placed in the two globes and, amid swirls of gas and glowing blue sparks, the transfer is made. All mental, spellcasting, and psionic abilities are transferred between the two bodies. The new form has the Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, and Charisma of the host, but the Intelligence and Wisdom of the transferred mind. The subjects are struck unconscious for 1d3 turns. //Transpossessed// subjects detect as neutral to all spells and psionics that would reveal alignment, ethos, or personality.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The second power, //soul splitting//, divides a single subject into two personalities. The split separates some property of the psyche into its opposing elements—good vs. evil, law vs. chaos, wisdom vs. folly, and other opposing forces. The two persons are physically similar, differing only in ways that characterize the nature of the split and the strength of each trait. The good personality may be fair and strong, if the original subject was filled with good, or sickly and pale if the subject was less than noble. Each personality has the full knowledge and abilities (within the limits of the separation) of the original body.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The two forms are also utterly opposed to each other, so that cooperation is impossible. Depending on the nature of the separation, one seeks to destroy the other or reverse the //soul splitting// process. An evil twin would seek its counterpart’s death while the good one tries for reunion. A wise twin might revel in freedom from the foolish half. A foolish twin is likely to become wild and bestial, filled with more-than-animal cunning. In all cases, the two separated properties become concentrated and exaggerated in each individual until the distilled trait dominates their personalities. It radiates with astonishing intensity to detection spells revealing that trait.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The third power is that of //soul fusing//. Here, two personalities are joined in one body. Normally this is done to reverse the process of //soul splitting//, but it is possible to merge two unrelated personalities into a single creature. The merged form now has two separate minds within it. Each retains its own personality, including all class, mental, spellcasting, and psionic powers, One personality, however, cannot use the powers of the other.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The result of this fusion is seldom harmonious, for unless the two minds are in perfect agreement on all things, they vie for control of the body. Any time there is a disagreement over a course of action, an Intelligence check is made for each mind. Should one succeed and the other fail, that personality seizes physical control. The subject’s mannerisms, voice, accent, likes, and dislikes are instantly those of the dominant personality. Should both fail, the subject is racked by fearsome headaches so severe that any action is impossible. If both succeed, the subject’s body is the battleground for control. Movements become confused and jerky, behavior erratic from moment to moment, as each tries to assert itself.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Attempts to detect the mental nature of such a person reveal details of the current dominant personality. If there is no dominant force, the result is a confused blur that might be mistaken for neutrality.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>**Curse:** With the apparatus there are perils both for those subjected to its horrible transformations and for those who would use it upon themselves or others.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>For subjects, beyond the perils described above, there is a chance that, unable to reconcile oneself to the alteration, madness results. The subject (or subjects in the case of a split) must immediately roll a successful saving throw vs. death magic or succumb to incurable madness. After that, the subject must roll a successful saving throw every day for a full week. Only after this time is the subject able to come to terms with the situation. Note that for those subjected to //soul fusing//, each personality must roll a separate saving throw and it is perfectly possible for one personality to be sane and the other to be utterly mad.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The experimenter risks other fates each time the apparatus is used. There is a 20% chance (noncumulative) that the energies of the apparatus create a field that transfers the device and surrounding locale (such as the building housing it), along with all characters, into Ravenloft. (Players familiar with the demiplane know this is a serious curse.)</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>**In Ravenloft:** Where the device was originally found, the operator must roll a dark powers check each time the device is used—even if the operator is the subject. Evil “twins” created by the apparatus are immediately adopted by the land.</wrap>\\

**Suggested Means of Destruction:**
* The machine itself is quite fragile and can be easily destroyed. However, it recreates itself at some other place and time.
* The characters must travel back in time to the workshops of the original alchemist and there destroy him, his works, and all his notes.
* Mystical barriers blocking the blend of science and magic must be built to protect each world in the Prime Material Plane. This does not destroy it. It merely prevents its appearance in that world.

of Dreadful Construction
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** —
New Item
Reports have surfaced from those who visit other worlds of the appearance of a bizarre device that disrupts the tranquility of civilized life. Sages who collect and study such reports say that a large wheeled mechanism, reputed to be made of adamantite-alloyed iron, has briefly appeared on certain worlds at random to leave a trail of chaos in its wake. The purpose and origins of the device are a mystery, but a few facts are known about it.\\
<wrap indent>The //apparatus of dreadful construction//, as it has come to be known, resembles a huge, iron, fully enclosed, two-wheeled chariot lacking the front bar to which horses would be harnessed. It stands about 15 feet high, 20 feet wide, and 25 feet long. Its weight is guessed to be 15 to 30 tons. Three great metal chimneys rear from its stern, spewing sparks and flames up to 30 feet into the air. (The fires cause any flammable material within 30 feet of the device to save vs. normal fire or burn.) Two monstrous studded wheels enable the apparatus to cross any terrain at a constant speed (MV 24, or 8.182 miles per hour), night or day. Most fearsome, however, are the eight human-sized metal teeth at its front, each driven by a great piston, which chew through every kind of stone, metal, or other substance. If the apparatus runs into a cliff or mountainside, it digs its way through at a reduced but still rapid speed (MV 18), leaving a permanent tunnel behind it. Any being run over by this device, whether crushed by a wheel or “bitten” by a metal tooth, takes 10d12 points of crushing damage and 6d6 points of heat damage (no saving throw), and must pass a system shock roll or die at once.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>As the apparatus travels across the landscape, it destroys everything before it in a path 20 feet wide, moving in a perfectly straight (if not entirely level) line. Nothing, not even a wish spell, can turn it aside or direct its movements. Witnesses report that the apparatus is able to survive falls from considerable heights without dam- age, observing that it continued on its journey as if nothing happened. The single mindedness of the apparatus’s movements and feats leads most observers to believe that it has escaped its original owner or creator and is now running without any intelligent control.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>As it moves, part of the mechanism takes the rocky material it destroys, draws the debris into the vehicle, and leaves it behind in the form of a black paved road measuring 12 feet wide, with churned earth and ground rock littering either side. The created road is exceptionally durable, making all saving throws as metal +4. Immediately after the passage of the apparatus, however, the roadway is extremely hot, doing 6d6 points of damage to anyone who touches it; it cools by one die of damage for every hour that passes after it begins to cool. Furthermore, the road contains poisonous substances that kill all plant life within 50 yards for a full year. This road, though of high quality, of course leads nowhere in particular except by random chance. Any city unlucky enough to be in the path of the device must be abandoned until it has departed, leaving road and ruin behind it.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The apparatus travels from world to world as a result of a random //plane shift// power, 1-20 rounds after it is fully submerged in water—ocean, lake, or river. After its //plane shift//, it reappears out of the deep waters of another world, in another crystal sphere, to drive across the landscape until it reaches water again. A few wizards and priests discovered this aspect of its nature and exploited it by having lakes dug and filled in its path to protect cities, causing the device to leave their world for another.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Though the device has caused destruction in its passage across inhabited lands, the ruin is very limited in scope and the damage is eventually reversed (though the roadway it creates remains). In some cases, its passage has even been beneficial, as it opens tunnels through the most impassable mountains and builds roads across the worst terrain. It is more an annoyance than a real threat. The device radiates enormous, powerful magic, and its invulnerability to all forms of magical and physical attack certainly indicate that it is an artifact. Because the upper part of the apparatus has the appearance of a beast’s head, complete with fiery nostrils and smokestack “horns,” it is sometimes called the Iron Bull, as well as Ground-Eater, Road-Maker, the Starving Juggernaut, and a few less pleasant epithets (particularly thrown by those who have lost farms and forests to its flames).</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Certain elements of its appearance have led to speculations that it was built with the assistance of Krynnish tinker gnomes (Minoi), though there is neither record nor proof of this. (Indeed, some tinker gnomes actively pursue the device in order to learn more about it.) Another theory is that it is a reactivated relic from the ancient empire of Blackmoor—of Mystara, not of Oerth. The truth cannot be known at this time. As its first appearance in the Known Spheres dates back to only 130 years, the assumption of scholarly sages is that the device is either of recent construction or lay dormant until accidentally activated by a curious (and no doubt now deceased) discoverer.</wrap>

DUNGEON MastTER Guide, 1st Edition
When found, this item is a large, sealed iron barrel, but it has a secret catch that opens a hatch in one end. Inside are 10 levers:

^ Level ^ Effect |
| 1 | Extend/retract legs and tail |
| 2 | Uncover/cover forward porthole |
| 3 | Uncover/cover side portholes |
| 4 | Extend/retract pincers and feelers |
| 5 | Snap pincers |

| 7 | Backward/left or right |
| 8 | Open “eyes” with continual light inside/close “eyes” |
| 9 | Raise (levitate) or sink |
| 10 | Open/close hatch |

<wrap indent>The apparatus moves forward at a speed of three, backward at six. Two pincers extend forward 4 feet and snap for 2d6 points of damage each if they hit a creature-25% chance, no reduction for armor, but Dexterity reduction applies (5% per bonus point). The device can operate in water up to 900 feet deep. It can hold two human-sized characters and enough air to operate for 1d4+1 hours at maximum capacity. The apparatus is AC 0 and requires 100 points of damage to cause a leak, 200 to stave in a side. When the device is operating it looks something like a giant lobster.</wrap>\\

This item exactly resembles the //apparatus of Kwalish// except that, when activated, it becomes a 10-piece one-man-band renowned for its cacophony. It enrages all who hear it, including party members, unless a saving throw vs. spell is made. Those who fail the saving throw will attempt to do harm to the operator until he or she stops playing the apparatus. Of course, the owner is //charmed// by the device and continues to operate it.

===== Apple =====
Although they are extremely rare, two magical apples have been discovered.

of Bragi
**XP Value:** 500 **GP Value:** 2,500
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Master Set
In Scandinavian legend, Bragi (son of Odin) had a magically inexhaustible supply of these apples. Each can cure weariness, decay of power, ill temper, or failing health.

of Chaos
**XP Value:** 300 **GP Value:** 3,000
POLYHEDRON Newszine 26
The apple of chaos is a 5-inch-diameter apple of gold. If thrown, its material form disappears where it lands, but its image remains (a phantasm), affecting all creatures within 40 feet of it. All victims are affected as if by the Sth-level wizard spell chaos, suffering confusion (as the druid spell). Normal fighters (not paladins or rangers), illusionists, creatures with Intelligence 4 or less, and monsters that do not use magic may each make a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect; no other creatures gain a saving throw. The confusion lasts for 20 rounds, until the phantasmal apple disappears. The image (and the effect) may be removed by a dispel magic spell, but checked against 20th-level magic use.

===== Apron =====
Aprons are used for a multitude of purposes. Mostly, they protect the wearer from the effects of heat, sparks, or haphazard knife wielding. Magical aprons, on the other hand, can be used to relieve fatigue, grant cooking proficiencies, or promote cleanliness.

of Comfort
**XP Value:** 800 **GP Value:** 4,000
POLYHEDRON Newszine 57
This magical apron must be worn to be effective. It makes its wearer immune to heat and fatigue caused from long hours in the kitchen, or from prolonged adventuring in hot climes. The apron also catches spills and stains before they touch the wearer or the wearer’s clothing. Upon uttering the command word, the apron cleans itself and appears new. The apron increases the cooking proficiency of the wearer by +3. If the wearer cannot cook, the apron taps natural talents and grants the basic proficiency in cooking.

This huggable, lovable stuffed magical bear is made of white ermine. It sports an onyx nose, sapphire eyes, and is stuffed with owlbear down. During the slumber hours, this small bear radiates a //sphere of protection// in a radius of 3 yards. The sphere keeps invading forces from entering the mind of any sleeping person. //ESP// and mindaffecting spells, including psionics, do not work on any subjects sleeping within the bear’s domain. The stuffed animal also prevents those in its area of effect from suffering bad dreams. Because of the restful nature of sleep while slumbering near the bear, hit points are restored at twice the normal rate.

Arcane formulae are recipes for converting a victim into another, often mystical, form. Generally, the formula converts living or recently deceased wizards and priests into undead versions of liches.

for a Dracolich
XP\ Value: — **GP Value:** —
FORGOTTEN REALMS MC Appendix
The creation of a dracolich is a complex process involving the transformation of an evil dragon by arcane magical forces, the most notorious practi- tioners of which are members of the Cult of the Dragon. The process is usually a cooperative effort between the evil dragon and the wizards, but especially powerful wizards have been known to coerce an evil dragon to undergo transformation against its will.\\
<wrap indent>Any evil dragon is a possible candidate for transformation, although old dragons or older with spellcasting abilities are preferred. Once a candidate is secured, the wizards first prepare the dragon’s host, an inanimate object that holds the dragon’s life force. The host must be a solid item of not less than 2,000 gp value, resistant to decay (wood, for instance, is unsuitable). A gemstone is commonly used as a host, particularly a ruby, pearl, carbuncle, and jet, and is often set in the hilt of a sword or other weapon. The host is prepared by casting //enchant an item// upon it and speaking the name of the evil dragon; the item may resist the spell by successfully saving vs. spell as an 11th-level wizard. If the spell is resisted, another item must be used for the host. If the spell is not resisted, the item can then function as a host. If desired, //glassteel// can be cast upon the host to protect it.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Next, a special potion is prepared for the evil dragon to consume. The exact composition of the potion varies according to the age and type of dragon, but it must contain precisely seven ingredients, among them a //potion of evil dragon control//, a //potion of invulnerability//, and the blood of a vampire. When the evil dragon consumes the potion, the results are determined as follows (roll percentile dice):</wrap>

^ Roll ^ Result |
| O1-10 | No effect. |
| 11-40 | Potion does not work. The dragon suf- fers 2d12 points of damage and is helpless with convulsions for 1d2 rounds. |
| 41-50 | Potion does not work. The dragon dies. A full wish or similar spell is needed to restore the dragon to life; a wish to transform the dragon into a dracolich results in another roll on this table. |
| 51-00 | Potion works |

<wrap indent>If the potion works, the dragon’s spirit transfers to the host, despite the distance between the dragon’s body and the host. A dim light within the host indicates the presence of the spirit. While contained in the host, the spirit cannot take any actions; it cannot be contacted nor attacked by magic. The spirit can remain in the host indefinitely.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Once the spirit is contained in the host, the host must be brought within 90 feet of a reptilian corpse; under no circumstances can the spirit possess a living body. The spirit’s original body is the ideal, but the corpse of any reptilian creature that died or was killed within the previous 30 days is suitable.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The wizard who originally prepared the host must touch the host, cast a //magic jar// spell while speaking the name of the dragon, then touch the corpse. The corpse must fail a saving throw vs. spell for the spirit to successfully possess it; if it saves, it never accepts the spirit. The following modifiers apply to the roll:</wrap>

| -10 | If the corpse is the spirit’s own former body (which can be dead for any length of time)
| -4 | If the corpse is of the same alignment as the dragon
| -4 | If the corpse is that of a true dragon (any type)
| -3 | If the corpse is that of a firedrake, ice lizard, wyvern, or fire lizard |
| -1 | If the corpse is that of a dracolisk, dragonne, dinosaur, snake, or other reptile |

<wrap indent>If the corpse accepts the spirit, it becomes animated by the spirit. If the animated corpse is the spirit’s former body, it immediately becomes a dracolich; however, it does not regain the use of its voice and breath weapon for another seven days (note that it is unable to cast spells with verbal components during this time). At the end of seven days, the dracolich regains the use of its voice and breath weapon.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>If the animated corpse is not the spirit’s former body, it immediately becomes a protodracolich. A protodracolich has the mind and memories of its original form, but the hit points, immunities to spells, and priestly turning of a dracolich. A protodracolich can neither speak nor cast spells. Furthermore, it cannot cause chilling damage, use a breath weapon, or cause fear as a dracolich. Its Strength, movement, and Armor Class are those of the possessed body.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>To become a full dracolich, a protodracolich must devour at least 10% of its original body. Unless the body has been dispatched to another plane of existence, a protodracolich can always sense the presence of its original body, whatever the distance. A protodracolich tirelessly seeks its original body to the exclusion of all other activities. If its original body has been burned, dis- membered, or otherwise destroyed, the protodracolich need only devour the ashes or pieces equal to or exceeding 10% of its original body mass (total destruction of the original body is possible only through use of a //disintegrate// or similar spell; the body could be reconstructed with a //wish// or similar spell, so long as the spell is cast in the same plane as the disintegration). If a protodracolich is unable to devour its original body, it is trapped in its current form until slain.</wrap>\\
</wrap indent>A protodracolich transforms into a full dracolich within seven days after it devours its original body. When the transformation is complete, the dracolich resembles its original body; it can now speak, cast spells, and employ the breath weapon of its original body, besides having all of the abilities of a dracolich.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The procedure for possessing a new corpse is the same as explained above, except that the assistance of a wizard is no longer necessary (casting //magic jar// is required only for the first possessions). If the spirit successfully repossesses its original body, it again becomes a full dracolich. If the spirit possesses a different body, it becomes a protodracolich and must devour its former body to become a full dracolich.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>A symbiotic relationship exists between a dracolich and the wizards who create it. The wizards honor and aid their dracolich, and provide it with regular offerings of treasure items. In return, the dracolich defends its wizards against enemies and other threats, as well as assisting them in their various schemes. Like dragons, dracoliches are loners, but they take comfort in the knowledge that they have allies.</wrap>

for a Lich
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** —
Lords of Darkness
To become a lich, a wizard or wizard/priest must attain at least the 18th-level of experience as a wizard. A candidate for lichdom must have access to the spells //magic jar//, //enchant an item//, and //trap the soul//. N//ulathoe’s ninemen//, a Sth-level wizard spell that serves to preserve corpses against decay, keeping them as strong and supple as in life, is also required.\\
<wrap indent>The procedure for attaining lichdom is ruined if the candidate dies at any point during the process. Even if successful //resurrection// follows, the workings must be started anew. The procedure involves the preparation of a magical phylactery and a potion. Most candidates prepare the potion first and arrange for an apprentice or ally to raise them if ingestion of the potion proves fatal. Preparation of the phylactery is so expensive that most candidates do not wish to waste all the effort of its preparation by dying after it is completed but before they are prepared for lichdom.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The nine ingredients of the potion are as follows:</wrap>\\
* Arsenic (2 drops of the purest distillate).
* Belladonna (1 drop of the purest distillate).
* Blood (1 quart of blood from a dead pegasus foal, killed by wyvern venom).
* Blood (1 quart from a dead demihuman slain by a phase spider).
* Blood (1 quart from a vampire or a being infected with vampirism).
* Heart (the intact heart of a humanoid killed by poisoning, a mixture of arsenic and belladonna must be used).
* Reproductive glands (from seven giant moths, dead for less than 10 days, ground together).
* Venom (1 pint or more, drawn from a phase spider less than 30 days prior)
* Venom (1 pint or more, drawn from a wyvern less than 60 days prior)

<wrap indent>The ingredients are mixed in the order given, by the light of a full moon, and must be drunk within seven days after they combine into a sparkling black liquid that gleams with a bluish radiance. All of the potion must be drunk by the candidate, and within six rounds produces an effect as follows (roll percentile dice):</wrap>

^ Roll ^ Effect |
| 01-10 | All body hair falls out, but potion is ineffective (the candidate knows this). Another potion must be prepared if lichdom is desired. |
| 11-40 | Candidate falls into a coma for 1d6+1 days, is physically helpless and immobile, mentally unreachable. Upon waking, potion works; the candidate knows this. |
| 41-70 | Potion works, but candidate is //feebleminded//. Any failed attempt to cure the candidate’s condition is 20% likely to slay the candidate. |
| 71-90 | Potion works, but candidate is //paralyzed// for 2d6+2 days (no saving throw, despite curative magic). There is a 30% chance for permanent loss of 1d6 Dexterity points. |
| 91-96 | Potion works, but candidate is permanently: |
| 01-33 Deaf |
| 34-66 Dumb |
| 67-00 Blind\\ The lost sense can only be regained by a //wish// or //limited wish//. |
| 97-00 | Death of the candidate. Potion does not work. |

<wrap indent>The successfully prepared candidate for lichdom can exist for an indefinite number of years before becoming a lich. Lichdom is not achieved at death unless preparation of his or her phylactery is complete. A successfully prepared candidate may appear somewhat paler of skin than before imbibing the potion, but cannot be mentally or magically detected by others as ready for lichdom. The candidate, however, is always aware of readiness for lichdom, even if //charmed//, insane, or memory loss occurs. (A //charmed// candidate can never be made to reveal the location of the phylactery—although he or she could be com- pelled to identify what the phylactery is, if it is shown.)</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The phylactery may take any form—it may be a pendant, gauntlet, scepter, helm, crown, ring, or even a lump of stone. It must be of inorganic material, must be solid and of high-quality workmanship if made by humans and cannot be an item having other spells or magical properties in it. It may be decorated or carved in any fashion.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>//Enchant an item// is cast on the phylactery (this is one of the rare cases in which this spell can be cast on unworked material), a process requiring continual handling of the phylactery for a long time. The phylactery must successfully make its saving throw as noted in the spell description. It must be completely enchanted within nine days (not the 24 hours normally allowed by the spell). Note that the “additional spell” times given in the //enchant an item// spell description are required.</wrap\\
<wrap indent>When the phylactery is made ready for enchantment, the candidate must cast trap the soul on it. Percentile dice are rolled; the spell has a 50% chance or working, plus 6% per level of the candidate (or caster, if it is another being) over 11th level. The phylactery glows with a flickering, blue-green //faerie fire// radiance for one round if it is successfully receptive for the candidate’s essence.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The candidate then must cast //Nulathoe's ninemen// on the phylactery, and within one turn of doing so, cast //magic jar// on it and enter it with his or her life force. No victim is required for this use of the magic jar spell. Upon entering the phylactery, the candidate instantly loses one experience level along with its commensurate spells and hit points. The essence and lost hit points remain in the phylactery, which becomes AC 0 and maintains those hit points from now on. The candidate is now a lichnee, and must return to his or her own body to rest for 1d6+1 days. The ordeal of becoming a lichnee is so traumatic that the candidate forgets any memorized spells of the top three levels available, and cannot regain any spells of those levels until the rest period is completed. (Candidates usually resume a life of adventuring to regain the lost level.)</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The next time the lichnee candidate dies, despite the manner or planar location of death, or barriers of any sort between corpse and phylactery, the candidate’s life force goes into the phylactery. For it to emerge again, there must be a recently dead (less than 30 days) corpse within 90 feet of the phylactery. The corpse may be that of any creature, and must fail a saving throw vs. spell to be possessed. If it makes its saving throw, it never receives the lich. If the creature had 3 Hit Dice or fewer in life, it saves as a 0-level fighter. If it had 3+1 Hit Dice or greater in life, it saves as if it were alive, with the following alignment modifiers:</wrap>\\
| LG, CG, NG: +0  |
| LN, CN, N: -3  |
| LE: 4  |
| NE: -5  |
| CE: -6  |
The candidate’s own corpse, if within range, is at -10, and may have been dead for any length of time. The lichnee may attempt to enter its own corpse once per week until it succeeds. (A phylactery too well hidden might never offer the lichnee a corpse to enter. Many lichnee commit suicide to save themselves such troubles.) When the lichnee enters its own corpse, it rises in 1d4 turns as a full lich, with all memorized spells and all undead abilities described in the //Monstrous Manual™// accessory.

===== Ardraken’s Refreshment Simulacrum =====
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** 11,500
The Book of Wondrous Inventions
Ardraken, a wizard from Greyhawk adventuring in another dimension, first discovered the creature named “Cola.” Cola was a rectangular, human-sized thing. It spoke few words, but was very friendly. For just two silver pieces, Cola gave a total stranger a refreshing elixir. Once back in Greyhawk, Ardraken resolved to create his own “cola.”\\
<wrap indent>//Ardraken refreshment simulacrum// is a colorful box standing on one end. Its usual colors are red, white, and blue, Glowing runes read, “Cola,” “Drink,” “New Generation,” “Exact Change When Lit,” and other arcane sayings. A small opening large enough to accept a coin is located midway to the top, on the right. One foot from the bottom is a large aperture, almost as wide as the box. Ideally, the thing affably greets people, then offers its elixir for a mere two silver pieces.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>**Construction:** 11,500 gp; 17 days.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>A simulacrum is magically created to duplicate another living being. The process calls for an ice model of the creature to be duplicated. Thus, a refreshment simulacrum requires a block of ice with the dimensions given under Statistics. The water for the ice is mixed first with crushed red, white, and blue precious gems, Each gemstone must be valued at 100 gp. Three gems of each color are needed. The mixture is frozen around a container of that exotic potion Elixir of Cola, called simply “cola,” named for the creature that produces it. The cola is usually contained in metal cylinders. If found in Oerth markets, a 12-ounce cola is worth 600 gp. The ice model is carved with the proper runes. Finally, the spells //reincarnation// and //limited wish// or //create monster// are cast. These give the simulacrum life and the ability to imitate Cola’s talents.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>**Statistics:** Size: 2 x 4 x 6 feet. Weight: 300 pounds.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Two silver pieces are put in the metal slot, and the simulacrum drops a potion in a metal cylinder through the lower aperture. It can also accept other coins and will make correct change. Both processes are magical conversions—silver to elixir.<\wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Somehow these enchantments never malfunction for the wizard who casts them, so a cola always operates perfectly for the wizard that made it. For anyone else, any number of nasty things can happen. First, Cola may accept money, but not give any change due. Half the time, it dismisses the user with a simple taunt: “No drinks for you, scum.” Those less fortunate are either attacked or become the recipients of one of Cola’s Special Drinks. Each Special differs from the last and its effects are always malign. At best, a Special Drink is noxious and gives the imbiber an embarrassing acne problem. The worst Specials cause insanity, loss of hit points, or death. It is believed these hazards prove that simulacrums are inherently evil. Simulacrums are thought to fear their makers and therefore do them no mischief.<\wrap>\\

**Cola:** AC 2; 7 HD; hp 28; MV nil; AT 1d3, Range 16; Dmg 1d4+3; AL CE. The creature attacks by firing 1d3 of its drinks as missiles. If reduced to half its hit points or less, Cola gives up and offers its attackers the real elixir.

===== Arm =====
Magical arms are prosthetics that are placed in an empty socket, such as an elbow or shoulder joint. The arm, once in place, grafts to the user, becoming an easily manipulated appendage. Prosthetics are often permanently attached until a dispel magic or remove curse is cast upon the item or user, but some can be removed by simply speaking the command word.

of Doom
**XP Value:** 8,000 **GP Value:** 40,000
New Item
This scaled, taloned, reptilian limb is believed to have been severed from a lizard man long ago, and infused with powerful magic by a Calishite archmage who was later killed by an apprentice employing the arm. It grafts itself to the chest, back, pelvis, or shoulders of any creature who touches it and wills a union (and location of attachment). It becomes part of the body of the afflicted creature and is under the same muscular control as the creature’s own normal limbs.\\
<wrap indent>In the early days of Calimshan (when that country was a loose collection of warring satraps and self-styled pashas), a mountain stood near the city of Calimport. The Sunspire was a tall, needle-pointed cone honeycombed with internal passages. The subterranean depths beneath the peak were flooded, and home to many lizard men. These ‘scalyskins’ raided coastal Calimshan at will, retreating to their lightless, watery lair whenever strong forces rose to oppose them.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>One day, a local pasha looked out over his ruined city after one too many lizard man raids, and resolved to destroy the scalyskins of Sunspire. The pasha, Thurongh Klazarr, hired all the wizards he could find, and they worked powerful spells together, blasting the Sunspire until it collapsed, crushing the lizard man colony inside. Only a few scalyskin raiding bands escaped; one was taken in by the evil, reclusive archmage Ilthoon Sarshimm. Ilthoon wanted guards for his home (now a long—vanished tower northwest of Calimport), but found his authority challenged by the leader of the lizard men—so he slew that scalyskin and took one of its arms as his own. He laid powerful spells on the limb, to preserve, animate, and control it. He made it into a removable body part, which grafts itself onto the user and becomes a directly controlled limb (it need not replace a missing limb, but can function as an “extra”). Throughout the years that followed, Iithoon added magical powers to the arm, ruling the towns around his tower by fear. There were tales of the disembodied limb crawling about at night by itself, strangling folk, and it became known as the arm of doom. Ilthoon was ultimately slain by a treacherous apprentice employing the arm—but that unfortunate wizardling fell afoul of brigands soon after, and the arm saw use in brigand ambushes and feuds throughout Calimshan for many years. It is believed to have since fallen into the possession of an agent of That, and to have traveled with him around the Heartlands, seeing use in night strangling and alley attacks. Its precise, current whereabouts (and its owner’s identity) are unknown.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>**Powers:** The arm of doom can punch and slash foes for 2d12 hp damage per round, and it can pass through metal barriers (such as armor, shields, shackles, and the bars of prison cells) as if they do not exist to attack targets (the metal is not affected in any way by the passage of the arm). It is immune to all magical attacks and effects, even those that the host body may succumb to (a Aeld being would be frozen, but not the arm of doom).</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The touch of the arm of doom, on any item bearing a dweomer suspends the operation of all item magic for one turn, one time only. (That particular item can never again be affected by the arm; its magic isn’t ruined, nor does its duration “run out,” it simply doesn’t work for one turn.)</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The arm serves until the being it is attached to is slain or it has taken 50 lives while attached to a single being. Whenever either of these states is reached, the arm tears free, and crawls away at MV 9 (can jump to 20 feet horizontally), seeking another living being. If the arm tears free, it does 4d6 damage, and forces a system shock roll.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The arm is rumored to have other powers, and perhaps even a destiny (to slay particular types, nationalities, or classes of beings, regardless of the wishes of the being attached to it), but these are the subject of great controversy among sages, and have not yet been clearly established.</wrap>

Silver Arm of Ergoth
**XP Value:** 10,000 **GP Value:** 50,000
Dragons of Light
The //silver arm of Ergoth// was forged by dragon, elf, man, and dwarf during the creation of the original dragonlances. This artifact is able to guide the //hammer of Kharas// to the exact location of the dragonmetal to create a perfect lance. Only with pure dragonmetal, the //silver arm//, and the //hammer of Kharas//, can lasting dragonlances be crafted. The //silver arm// also acts as a //ring of regeneration// for its owner.

Silver Arm of Ergoth II
**XP Value:** 9,000 **GP Value:** 45,000
Tales of the Lance
The //silver arm of Ergoth// was created by dwarves, elves, men, and good dragons during the Third Dragon War. Used to forge the original //dragonlances//, it was used again during the recent war against the Dragon Empire.\\
<wrap indent>The arm must be attached to a humanoid with a Strength of at least 17. The person must be of good alignment and be missing his or her right arm. When a proper wearer places the arm to his or her right shoulder, the arm grafts itself to the character and becomes a normal arm for all common tasks.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>When used with the //hammer of Kharas//, however, the //silver arm of Ergoth// has the power to properly forge //dragonlances// from dragonmetal. Only with the //hammer of Kharas//, the //silver arm of Ergoth//, pure dragonmetal, and the skill of a blacksmith or weaponsmith can true //dragonlances// be forged. The arm acts as a //ring of regeneration//.</wrap>

of Valor
**XP Value:** 8,000 **GP Value:** 40,000
The Ruins of Myth Drannor
This priceless item is one of two known surviving //power arms// in the Realms (the other is in the keeping of the Heralds, in the Herald’s Holdfast)—and only certain senior Harpers and powerful wizards such as Elminster know about the other one.\\
<wrap indent>Made by a cabal of mighty archmages when Myth Drannor was strong, the //arm of valor// takes the form of five pieces of full, adamantite plate armor. Together, the five pieces form a complete covering for one arm (they alter size and shape to fit either arm of any M-sized creature), There is no known way to dispel the magic instilled in them, and they make all saving throws at | on 1d20. (If three or more pieces are worn together, the save drops to 0 or automatic.)</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Whenever any power of any piece of the arm is used, there is a 1% chance (not cumulative) that one of the pieces vanishes, //teleporting// far away (despite the mythal), and draining the life—force from the wearer. The power that was used takes full effect, but the wearer suffers 1d12 hp damage, and permanently loses an additional 1d2 hit points, The arm was designed for use by champions defending Myth Drannor; its powers override all mythal powers and aren’t subject to wild magic.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The pieces are a //gauntlet//, //vambrace// (tubular covering for the forearm), //couter// (a winged, hinged elbow-—covering), //rerebrace// (tubular cover for the upper arm), and a //pauldron// (shoulder cover, flaring up into a raised half—collar, and over to cover much of the chest and shoulder blade at the back). The //rerebrace// and //vambrace// each contain small (4 by 6 by 2 inches) storage compartments that latch shut, and are shielded against magical scrying.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Whenever any piece of the arm is first brought to within 200 feet of another, both pieces glow with a blue-white faerie fire for four rounds (this won’t happen again until the two pieces are farther apart, and then moved together again; it doesn’t happen continuously when the pieces are very close together or actually touching). When worn (“worn together” in this context means strapped onto the same arm of the same being), the pieces of armor confer the following powers:</wrap>

**Gauntlet**
* immunity to //charm//, //hold//, and //sleep// (and all related spells and psionics).
* punch does 1d4+1 points of damage, and can strike creatures only hit by +1 or better magical weapons,
* power smash (3d6 points of damage plus “crushing blow” saving throw forced on items struck) once per turn.
* //feather fall// at will.
* jump once per turn (range as the spell, but safe landing guaranteed).
* all weapons wielded solely by the arm wearing the vambrace strike at +1 damage.
* immunity to //ESP// spells, spell—like powers, and psionics.
* wearer can see invisible beings and objects (30-foot range).

**Couter**
* //dimension door// once per turn
* //airy water// (creates airy water automatically around the wearer, whenever submerged)
* wearer can see dweomers within 30 feet and distinguish between spell areas of effect, enchanted beings, and permanent magical auras.

**Rerebrace**
* temporarily raises the status of all weapons wielded by the wearer to the status of +2 magical weapons—+2 on damage and attack rolls, and can be used to hit beings struck only by magical weapons; these bonuses are not cumulative with magical weapon bonuses, (a +1 sword would be raised to +2, but a +2 sword doesn’t become +4), but are cumulative with vambrace bonuses, if both are worn together.
* immunity to all //illusion// and //phantasm// spells.

**Pauldron**
* wearer’s Armor Class improved by four points.
* immunity to all //enchantment// and //charm// spells.
* //force blast// once per turn (does 3d4 points of damage, neither has nor uses charges, additional impact powers as for a //ring of the ram//.

The //arm of valor// also has some cumulative additional powers, conferred only by combinations of various pieces worn together, as follows:

**Any Two Pieces Worn Together**
* immunity from all //polymorph// attacks.
* all system shock rolls automatically successful.
* immunity from magical //fear//.
* a bonus of +1 on all saving throws.

**Gauntlet, Vambrace, and Couter Worn Together**
* //dispel magic// (90-foot range, 90-arc ray, once per turn).
* magic missile (5 missiles, 1d4+1 points of damage each, one missile from each digit of gauntlet, one unleashed per turn, of all five missiles in the same round).
* immunity from //petrification//.

**Entire Arm Worn Together**
* additional +2 bonus on all saving throws.
* //fly// (four rounds maximum burst, one use per turn).
* //minor creation// once per day.
* //wizard eye// once per day.
* If all five pieces of the arm are worn together, they fuse into a flexible but solidly linked unit that can be readily separated at the wearer’s will, but not otherwise.

===== Armband =====
Armbands appear and function almost exactly like anklets, but are usually made of sturdier materials. In use, an armband is fastened about the upper arm— it does not function if attached to any other body part. It may not be used by an armless creature, although it may function on a tentacle. All other details for **Anklet** (command words, resistance, hit points, and so on) apply also to armbands.

Comfort of Sleep
**XP Value:** 300 **GP Value:** 1,500
DRAGON Magazine 73
These are black arm wrappings. An insomniac (or anyone else) wearing these bands sleeps soundly and comfortably.

of Death
**XP Value:** 250 **GP Value:** 1,200
The Book of Marvelous Magic
This armband appears to be an //armband of healing//, but when locked on the arm, the snakes of its insignia animate and bite the wearer. Both hit each round, with no attack roll required. Each inflicts one point of damage per bite and requires a saving throw vs. poison per bite—failure results in death. After the snakes are animated, the armband cannot unlock until destroyed.

of Healing
**XP Value:** 1,500 **GP Value:** 9,000
The Book of Marvelous Magic
This item bears the insignia of a caduceus—two snakes entwined about a staff. When locked on the arm of a priest, it causes any three //curing// spells cast by that priest to cure the maximum possible damage: seven points for a //cure light wounds//, 14 for a //cure serious wounds//, etc. Only three spells per day are affected.

of Music
**XP Value:** 700 **GP Value:** 7,000
The Book of Marvelous Magic
This item appears to be and functions in all respects as either an //armband of healing// or an //armband of strength//. However, each time it is activated, the armband emits the sounds of a brass band (with drums). The band plays a rousing march for one turn. These “concerts” don’t overlap if the armband is used while the music is playing; if the armband is activated three times in three successive rounds, the music lasts for three turns. The armband cannot be unlocked while it is producing music. The noise can be heard clearly within a 60-foot range, regardless of intervening walls, doors, etc., and may attract the attention of monsters within that area. Note that a //silence 15' radius// spell only dampens the effect slightly, reducing the range to 30 feet.

of Salutation
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** 1,500
The Book of Marvelous Magic
This armband bears the symbol of a fleur-de-lis. When locked on the arm, it causes the wearer to salute an opponent, bending the arm and raising hand to the eyebrow, before engaging in hand-to-hand combat. It has no effect on missile fire combat. The victim must hold the salute for one round, The opponent may attack during that round, gaining a +2 bonus on attack rolls. There is, however, a 50% chance that the opponent is so surprised it fails to attack that round. The wearer is never forced to salute an opponent more than once in any melee. Once the first salute is made, the armband cannot unlock unless a //wish// is used.

of Snake Changing
**XP Value:** 500 **GP Value:** 2,500
POLYHEDRON Newszine 17
These armbands, found in pairs, allow the user to cast an equivalent of the //polymorph self// spell, but the user can only change to some form of snake. Both bands must be worn and the power can be invoked once a day.

of Strength
**XP Value:** 750 **GP Value:** 8,000
The Book of Marvelous Magic
This band bears the symbol of a lion. When locked on the arm, it may be commanded to raise the wearer’s Strength score to 18 for one turn. It functions three times per day.

Trueheart’s Warding
**XP Value:** 6,900 **GP Value:** 42,000
Tales of the Lance
This armband of bronze is etched with a hawk that bears arrows in its talons and four roses upon its breast. Its tale is a twisted web of intrigue and tragedy.\\
<wrap indent>The armband’s origins are clouded in mystery to mortal inquirers. Eventually, it passed into the hands of Khantal Krellick “Oathbreaker,” who maintained a bloody feud with his brother. At last, weary of war, Khantal bequeathed the armband to his brother Novace to end their feud. Among the ranks of mercenaries, however, Novace’s magic armband became coveted by many. A soldier who desired the armband used a peculiar //dagger of venom// to slay Novace from behind. While the coward looted the body, the warrior Vanderjack who had witnessed the betrayal, confronted the villain with his crime. In the ensuing skirmish, Vanderjack slew the man. Vanderjack swore an oath to one day return the armband to its family.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>In the years that followed, Vanderjack’s path crossed that of the legendary Gregor Uth Matar. Seeing a similarity in the crests on the armband and Sir Gregor’s armor, Vanderjack passed the armband to Sir Gregor, who promised to return it to his relatives, who had that very crest. Whether Gregor ever intended to honor the bargain remains uncertain, Gregor bequeathed the armband to his daughter Kitiara. She wore it proudly and began her own career as a warrior. As time passed, she bid farewell to her family and gave the armband to her warrior brother Caramon, who still holds it.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>This artifact detects only as simple magic, for the depths of its powers are drawn from the spirit bound within the metal: the armband provides its wearer with several enchantments. The wearer receives //protection from normal missiles// and a +3 bonus to saves vs. magic and special attacks. Three times a day, the armband lets the wearer automatically avoid a special attack or reduce it to its minimal effect (DM’s option).</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The armband also works much like a //ring of protection +3//, improving the wearer’s Armor Class by 3. Further, only +2 weapons or better can strike the wearer for full damage. Other weapons only inflict | point of damage plus Strength and magical bonuses.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The armband can //heal// the wearer of all wounds once per day. With all of these abilities, //Trueheart'’s warding// is proof against the blight of age, ill will, and curses, and the wearer is undying.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>This artifact is the third in the //Circle of Love//, created by Sirrion for the goddess Mishakal during the Age of Dreams. To prove the strength of love over deceit, Mishakal drew the girl Mirri to the young enemy warrior Trae. They fell in love. Allied with Trae’s brother Heris, the lovers set to establishing peace between their warring nations. The evil god Hiddukel, however, betrayed the lovers, imprisoning each of their spirits in one artifact from the //Circle of Love//. Trae is bound in the Trueheart’s warding. The armband opposes the //dagger of vengeance// in Hiddukel’s //Triad of Betrayal//.<wrap>

of Variable Strength
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** 750
The Book of Marvelous Magic
This armband is indistinguishable from an //armband of strength// but, when commanded to function it drops the wearer’s Strength score to 3. The Strength score rises by one per turn, until 18 is reached, and drops again to 3 on the following turn. The victim’s original Strength returns only if a //remove curse// spell is applied by a spellcaster of 15th level.

===== Armor =====
In this section, there are descriptions of some very special kinds of armor. Before adding these to your campaign, however, be sure you are familiar with the armor gradation system:\\
<wrap indent>For each +1 bonus to armor, regardless of the type of armor, the wearer’s Armor Class moves down (AC 2 to 1, to 0, -1, -2, and so on). A normal shield improves the Armor Class by 1. A magical shield improves Armor Class like magical armor—to -1, -2, etc. Note, however, that Armor Class can never be improved beyond -10.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Thus, //chain mail +1// is like ordinary chain mail (AC 5), but one category better (AC 4). A shield +J is equal to Armor Class 8—two places better than no armor (+1 for bearing a shield, +1 for the magical bonus of the shield).</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>When adding magical armor to the game, be aware of sizing problems: 65% of all armor (except elven chain mail) is human size, 20% is elf size, 10% is dwarf size, and only 5% is sized for gnomes or halflings. (Elven chain mail sizing is determined on the table below.)</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>After determining the magical properties of the armor the character found, purchased, or traded for, roll on the two following tables to determine the type of armor and the construction materials. Please note that certain armor types do not require a roll on the materials table (for example, the different types of leather and padded armors). Roll on the table below to determine the type of item found.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>According to the first edition of the //DMG//, page 164:</wrap>

* Armor of +3 bonus is of special steel made from meteorite iron.
* +4 is mithral, alloyed with steel.
* +5 is adamantite, alloyed with steel.

Abbathor’s
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** -
Monster Mythology
Abbathor’s avatar’s leather armor +4 can cast blindness at one creature per round within 30 feet (save vs. spell at -6 to negate, -3 if looking away).

of Absorption
**XP Value:** 5,000 **GP Value:** 25,000
DUNGEONS & Dracons Rules Cyclopedia
If the user is hit by a blow that would cause an energy drain, this armor absorbs the draining effect and only the normal damage affects the user. Each energy drain causes the loss of one AC bonus modifier from the armor. When reduced to zero bonuses, the item crumbles to dust. (For instance, //armor +3// that has absorbed two energy drain attacks is now //armor +1//. If it absorbs yet another energy drain, it is reduced to zero and disintegrates.) This special power is not under the control of the user; a character cannot choose to suffer the energy drain and leave the item intact. The normal limit of one use per day does not apply to this power.

of Acidic Secretion*
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** +2,000
DRAGON Magazine 99
This //cursed armor// appears to be normal, magical armor, but it gives no benefit to the wearer in combat (though this is not known by the wearer). From the moment that the wearer first suffers damage while using this suit, the armor and any padding used with it secretes a corrosive acid for 1d20 rounds, causing 1d4 points of damage to the wearer each round (no saving throw). It takes a full turn (10 rounds) to remove this suit of armor, and it continues doing acidic damage during that entire time (if the secretion duration is still in effect).</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Due to the nature of the acid, the burns and blisters left by such wounds cannot be removed except by a //wish//, //alter reality//, or //tempus fugit// spell, although normal rest and healing does recover lost hit points. Once the 1d20 round, acid-secretion period is past, the armor is once again safe to wear.</wrap>

Anything
**XP Value:** 4,500 **GP Value:** 45,000
Unearthed Arcana
//Anything armor// can be of any construction, from leather to plate. Initially, it has a +1 dweomer, but, on command, it can become any sort of other normal magical armor—one of the types listed on the tables, and not necessarily of the same construction as the //anything armor// in its unchanged form (for example, //anything armor// that appears as leather can change into plate, or vice versa). However, each such change is singular; //anything armor// never forms into a specific type of armor more than once. A change into a nonspecial sort of armor lasts for one day (24 hours) before //anything armor// reverts to its usual +1 status. A change into armor with a special function (such as //plate mail of etherealness//) lasts but one hour. After the owner has commanded the //anything armor// to change three different times, the armor loses all of its magical properties.

DRAGON Magazine 181
Ideal gear for fledgling underwater adventurers, these weapons and suits of armor have bonuses that apply only underwater. After all, since the PCs are out of their element underwater, they may need advantages that they would not need on dry land. //Aquatic weapons// and armor cost half as much as their normal counterparts.\\
<wrap indent>**Free Action:** The DM may provide these weapons and armor with //free action// ability (only while underwater, of course) for an XP value equal to that of a normal, magical weapon or suit of armor. Note that with //free action//, an //aquatic long sword +1// is not difficult to swing undersea.</wrap>

Arcane
**XP Value:** 3,000 **GP Value:** 20,000
Lost Ships
A few of these blue giants have been encountered wearing magical armor. The arcane do not sell or give away their armor, and its stability is often (75%) linked to the wearer’s life. If an arcane is slain, the armor slowly melts away, dissolving despite any magic used to try to stop the process.\\
<wrap indent>//Armor of the arcane// magically alters in size to fit the wearer, and confers AC 3 protection. Two hit points of every physical attack striking the wearer are suffered by the armor, and are not subtracted from the wearer’s hit points. It protects the wearer from all forms of natural or magical mental influence and control, and similarly makes him or her immune to the effects of poisonous vapors. It prevents //cantrips// and all spells of the 3rd or lower levels from affecting the wearer, absorbing the spell energy for its own maintenance.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>A suit of //armor of the arcane// can absorb 1d20+12 points of damage before dissipating. Consider the contact of any spell to give the armor additional hit points-2 per spell level—with a //cantrip// giving a single point, unless the spell is one that normally deals damage. In such cases, the damage the spell would have done is gained by the armor as additional hit points of its own. All damage dealt by spells of the 4th or higher levels is suffered directly by the armor, until it is destroyed. All other spell effects (such as spells that do not cause damage) of such higher level spells affect the wearer directly, bypassing the armor’s protection completely, unless they involve poisonous vapors or mental attacks.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Finally, //armor of the arcane// confers 90-foot-range //infravision// upon any wearer who does not possess this power naturally. The armor itself saves as metal with a +3 bonus against all attack forms requiring a saving throw. An arcane who sees a nonarcane wearing such armor will challenge the individual. Anyone impersonating an arcane needs telepathic powers, not merely illusions, to be successful, and must know much of the arcane society, values, and aims. The challenging arcane offers the armor wearer whatever magical item he or she desires most in return for the armor—and the tale of how the being came to be wearing it. If the wearer refuses the deal, demands an artifact or too much magic in return, or offers the arcane an unbelievable tale, the arcane calls on other arcane, or its hired minions and directs them to attack the wearer. It then returns, invisible, following the wearer to see where the user goes and who he or she has dealings with, until the attack comes. The arcane continue to hire attackers until the armor is destroyed or surrendered. They don’t care if this involves the death of the wearer.</wrap>

Aslyferund’s
**XP Value:** 10,000 **GP Value:** 90,000
POLYHEDRON Newszine 90
Ages ago, when Myth Drannor was still a thriving, elven metropolis, there lived an armorer named Aslyferund who fashioned fine elven chain mail.\\
<wrap indent>One day, another armorer by the name of Grelifgray moved nearby. He, too, knew the secret of forging elven chain and soon started taking some of Aslyferund’s customers.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Aslyferund became furious and started adding more design and detail to his armor. This in turn made Grelifgray also exceed his prior creations. Grelifgray even went so far as to have a wizard enchant his armor.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Aslyferund knew at this point he could not better Grelifgray’s work and felt disgraced. He left Myth Drannor and traveled from town to town, doing odd jobs in exchange for food and lodging. While traveling overland one day during a terrible rainstorm, he sought shelter in a cave. After drying off, Aslyferund discovered that he was not alone.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Peering at him from the back of the cave was a massive, ancient gold wyrm. Aslyferund fell to his knees, begging for his life. The dragon laughed and told Aslyferund that she was good and kind and did not eat elves. They talked for hours, and soon the dragon learned of Aslyferund’s woes.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The dragon decided to help Aslyferund—but only if he could do her a favor. She explained to him that she had always wanted a crown, one that held the most beautiful gems from her horde. If he could fashion such a thing for her, she would show him how to make his armor rival Grelifgray’s.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Aslyferund immediately set to work and in three months created a monstrous crown bedecked with the most exquisite gems and jewels from the dragon’s horde. As she touched the crown her eyes misted over, and huge tears rolled down her cheeks, landing on her stomach scales, glistening and sparkling as they went.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Reaching down with a massive claw to her stomach, she tugged loose six of her golden scales—those that had been struck by her tears.</wrap>

She gave the scales, the size of small shields, to Aslyferund and explained that by working each into breastplates, he could create armor that would make the wearer immune to natural and magical fire, chlorine gas—and more. The wearer of the armor would be like the ancient wyrm herself, immune to nonmagical missile fire and impervious to blows by normal weapons. Only magical weapons would harm the wearer.\\
<wrap indent>Aslyferund thanked the dragon profusely and returned to Myth Drannor with his newfound knowledge. He spent the next year fashioning six suits of elven mail with gold dragon scale breastplates. The suits of armor were like no others, andeach bore Aslyferund’s mark—three holly berries etched in gold, in the center of the chest. The suits were as light as leather, but much stronger and considered //chain mail +5//.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Grelifgray immediately offered a fortune for the secret of the armor’s making, but Aslyferund refused to share it with anyone. Soon the king heard of the armor’s existence and wished to purchase a suit for himself when he and his escort reached Myth Drannor, however, they found Aslyferund murdered and his home a wreck. All six suits of Aslyferund’s armor were missing, and to this day the whereabouts of the armor is a mystery.</wrap>

of Blackflame
**XP Value:** 30,000 **GP Value:** 200,000
The Five Shires
This is one the rarest and most special magical items. It can be worn by any single being of halfling size or smaller, but cannot be worn over normal or magical armor, bulky backpacks, or the like, It looks to be a rigid but weightless suit of full plate armor that, when empty, is a shimmering black.\\
<wrap indent>When worn, it creates a vague, shifting aura of darkness, an other-than-solid garment. It confers no Armor Class protection, cannot be harmed, and does not stop physical attacks. It does not encumber or blind its wearer, may be worn by any class, and its darkness conceals the features of the wearer even against magical scrutiny.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>//Armor of blackflame// can be worn as long as desired and breathing is unrestricted. It cannot be removed unless the wearer does not resist, and can only be destroyed by a //disintegrate// or //wish// spell, or the touch of a //rod of cancellation// (no saving throw). If destroyed, the armor dissipates utterly; it cannot be repaired or magically restored.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>//Armor of blackflame// protects its wearer at all times from all natural and magical heat, flame, cold, and explosive attacks. A blast might hurl a wearer of //armor of blackflame// end over end, but no damage would be suffered. The armor’s weightlessness and total lack of encumbrance allows the wearer to swim, climb, and perform delicate tasks normally.<\wrap>

of Blending
**XP Value:** 500 **GP Value:** 4,000
Oriental Adventures
This armor looks like normal armor and //detect magic// does not reveal its special property. However, when the command word is spoken, the armor changes shape and form, appearing to all as a set of normal clothing. The armor retains all of its properties and functions normally, even when disguised. Its true nature can be seen by the use of a //true seeing// spell.

Blue Armor of the Crystalmist Mountains
**XP Value:** 3,000 **GP Value:** 17,500
GREYHAWK Adventures
Cut from the hide of an adult blue dragon, this suit of armor +3 was fashioned for use by the mountain dwarves of the Crystalmist range. The armor can be loosely hung on a human-sized character, though the character loses all dexterity bonuses to his or her Armor Class, and fights with a -2 attack penalty. Aside from the Armor Class bonus, the wearer saves against electrical attacks for half damage or none.

Bradlie’s Leather
**XP Value:** 250 **GP Value:** 2,500
1993 Collector Card 352
Bradlie’s suit of armor functions as a standard magical suit of //leather armor +1//. It is, however, so incredibly ugly that anyone wearing it always suffers a negative reaction adjustment. Bradlie loathes to wear the armor and has been looking for another suit that fits his needs better but thus far has not found one.

Callarduran Smoothhands’s Chain Mail

The avatar’s //chain +4// confers 80% magic resistance against spells cast by drow.

of Charm
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 7,500
DUNGEONS & DraGons Rules Cyclopedia
When the user is hit by an opponent, the opponent must make a saving throw vs. spell or become //charmed// by the user of this special armor (like the wizard spells //charm person// or //charm monster//). If a hand held weapon is used in the attack, the opponent gains a +4 bonus to the saving throw. Only one victim can be //charmed// each day, but any number of saving throws may be made before the //charm// is successful.

of Comfort*
**XP Value:** +500 **GP Value:** +2,500
DraGon Magazine 181
//Armor of comfort// is as comfortable to wear as ordinary clothing, and it may be slept in with no problems. For someone adventuring in the wilderness and camping out where an attack can come at any time, this comes close to being the ultimate low-level lifesaver. A suit of mundane armor that you already have on is far superior to //armor + 5// that you don’t have time to put on before the nocturnal raiders of your choice are in the middle of the camp.

of Command
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 10,000
DUNGEON MASTER Guide
This finely crafted armor radiates a powerful aura of magic. When worn, the armor bestows a dignified and commanding aura upon its owner. The wearer is treated as if he or she had a Charisma of 18 for all encounter reactions. Friendly troops within 360 feet of the user have their morale increased by +2. Since the effect arises in great part from the distinctiveness of the armor, the wearer cannot hide or be concealed in any way and still have the effect function.\\
<wrap indent>Bards wearing this armor are able to speak one command a day with the effects of the Ist-level priest spell //command//.</wrap>

of Concealed Wizardry*
**XP Value:** +300 **GP Value:** +1,500
Land of Fate
These armor types have their magical nature concealed by powerful spells, such that they do not respond to defect magic or similar spells (see **Weapon**, //of Concealed Wizardry//).

of Continual Cleanliness
**XP Value:** 1,200 **GP Value:** 12,000
Realmspace
This armor is believed to be unique. It is currently worn by a paladin named Kyriel Alathar Pellinore, son of Chiros Pellinore, Third Lord of Everlund, and proud servant of Tyr. Being obsessed with cleanliness, he had Prismal cast a cleaning invocation onto his //plate mail +2//, adding //permanency// to it as well. This makes his armor continuously clean. It is never dirty, nor does it rust or show blemishes.

of Coolness
**XP Value:** 250 **GP Value:** 1,250
DRAGON Magazine 181
//Armor of coolness// may be worn without any discomfort due to heat, and enables its wearer to operate in the hottest of natural environments (70 to 150° F) as well as in a temperate climate. Note that the temperatures must be due to the weather and not to any attack by fire, magic, or monstrous abilities; the armor does not give fire resistance. At the DM’s option, the armor can give protection against the natural environments of the Elemental Plane of Fire.

of Cure Wounds
**XP Value:** 5,000 **GP Value:** 40,000
DUNGEONS & Dracons Rules Cyclopedia
This armor can cure half the damage the user has incurred, whatever that amount may be, once per day. It can only cure the user, not another creature, and it cannot affect poison, disease, or any other damage except that caused by wounds.

This lamellar armor has no magical bonus to Armor Class, but it may be worn in the desert heat without ill effect to the wearer.

Dragonarmor
**XP Value:** 3,000 **GP Value:** 30,000
Tales of the Lance
This armor consists of a padded tunic and leggings topped by breast and shoulder plates made of dragon scale and plate mail. The thighs and shins are protected by additional plates, these attached separately. The full-sized helm is a two-piece arrangement, granting protection to the back of the neck as well as the face.\\
<wrap indent>//Dragonarmor// is custom-fitted to its wearer, who suffers an encumbrance penalty when wearing it. Others may find a suit either too loose or too tight, suffering a -1 penalty on all attacks and all proficiency checks that depend on Dexterity. Dragonarmor was the invention of Sargonnas for his Dark Lady during the War of the Lance.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>//Dragonarmor// is considered scale armor +2. Those who wear the tunic and leggings subtract 1d6 points from any cold— or fire—based attacks against them.</wrap>

Eastern Wooden
**XP Value:** 750 **GP Value:** 7,500
DRAGON Magazine 187
This armor closely resembles banded mail, except that it is made from strips of highly flexible wood, treated and enchanted to be no more cumbersome than leather armor. It offers protection equivalent to //chain mail +1// (AC 4). In addition to its protective value, the armor is silent and can be concealed beneath normal clothing. For these reasons, it is highly prized. This armor may be worn by characters others than druids. Priests and fighters may wear it to full effect; thieves may wear it, but may not perform thieving skills in it other than picking locks and listening at doors. The armor does not include a helm, but it is sometimes found along with a wooden //shield +1// of medium size.

of Eelix
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 5,000
DRAGON Magazine 139
This magical ring produces a suit of armor made of blue light around its wearer on demand. The armor is equivalent to chain mail but is weightless. This item may be used by any class for an unlimited duration.

of Electricity
**XP Value:** 1,500 **GP Value:** 15,000
DunGeons & Dracons Rules Cyclopedia
This armor can, on command of the user, become charged with magical, electrical force. If the user is hit while “charged,” the attacker takes 6d6 points of electrical damage. The attacker may make a saving throw vs. spell to take half damage; if a weapon is used in the attack, a +4 bonus to the saving throw applies. The armor can be charged or neutralized as often as desired by using command words, but it can only cause damage (“discharge”) once per day.

Elven Chain Mail

+3: 3,000 20,000
+4: 5,000 30,000
+5: 7,500 50,000
DUNGEON MASTER Guide
This is magical armor so fine and light that it can be worn under normal clothing without revealing its presence, Its lightness and flexibility allow even wizards and thieves to use it with few restrictions (see the //PHB//, Player Character Classes Chapter). Elven fighter/mages use it without restriction. However, it is rarely sized to fit anyone other than an elf or a half-elf. Roll percentile dice and consult the following table to ascertain what size character elven chain mail does fit:

^ Roll ^ Size of Elven Chain Mail |
| 01-10 | Gnome/Halfling (Hairfoot) |
| 11-15 | Dwarf/Halfling (Stout or Tallfellow) |
| 16-80 | Elf/Half Elf |
| 81-95 | Human size, normal (up to 6’, 200 pounds) |
| 96-00 | Human size, large (up to 6½’, 250 pounds) |

of Energy Drain
**XP Value:** 1,500 **GP Value:** 15,000
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Rules Cyclopedia
The armor can become “charged” on command (as described under the electricity special power), but instead of inflicting damage, it causes the loss of one of the opponent’s levels or Hit Dice (as if a wight). The same saving throw as the electricity power applies (possibly with bonuses); if successful, the energy drain does not occur. The item can drain one level or Hit Die per day, but any number of saving throws may be made before this occurs.

of Ethereality
**XP Value:** 5,000 **GP Value:** 30,000
Dunceons & Dracons Rules Cyclopedia
The user may become //ethereal// on command and remain so for as long as desired. The user may return to the Prime Material Plane when a second command word is spoken. Each command word may be used once per day.

of Etherealness
**XP Value:** 5,000 **GP Value:** 30,000
GREYHAWK
The most magical of all forms of armor, this suit of plate allows the wearer to take either of two options—wear it as //armor +3//, or decide to become ethereal. In the latter case, the wearer can move through solid objects and is subject to attack only by creatures that are able to come out of phase. Only spells such as //phase door// negate the etherealness of the armor. Attacks while ethereal are not possible. The armor can be made ethereal a total of 49 times, and then it becomes merely //armor +3//. It can never be recharged or restored.

of Etherealness II
**XP Value:** 5,000 **GP Value:** 30,000
DUNGEON MAsTER Guide
This is seemingly normal //armor +5//, but if a command word is spoken, the suit enables its wearer and all nonliving items either worn or carried to become ethereal, as if //oil of etherealness// had been used. While in the ethereal state the wearer cannot attack material creatures. A //phase door// spell negates the ethereal state and prevents the armor from functioning for one day.\\
<wrap indent>There are 20 charges placed upon //armor of etherealness//. Once used, the armor cannot be recharged. Furthermore, every five uses reduces the bonus of the armor by one—if five charges are used to become ethereal, the armor is +4, if 10 are used it is +3, +2 if 15 are used, and only +1 if all 20 are exhausted.</wrap>

Evil Dragon
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 7,500
DRAGON Magazine 62
In an era long past, an intrepid dragon-hunter and his wizard friend discovered that the hide of an evil dragon, if properly prepared, could be cut and formed into a suit of armor that provides protection against attack forms resembling the breath weapon of the dragon from which it was made.\\
<wrap indent>To begin the process, an evil dragon (white, black, red, blue, or green) of at least adult age must be killed, without the use of magic and preferably by means of repeated attacks with blunt weapons. Even a single magical attack directed against a dragon, whether or not the spellcasting succeeds and whether or not the spell causes damage to the dragon, ruins the protective potential of the creature’s hide and makes later attempts at enchantment ineffective. If the dragon is hit with edged weapons, there is a chance that the hide is cut and marred to such an extent that it becomes unusable as armor. For each successful hit on the dragon with an edged weapon (regardless of the amount of damage done), add 5% to the chance of the hide being damaged beyond use. (Thus, if a dragon takes 20 hits from edged weapons, there is no chance that the hide can be used as armor.) If and when the dragon is killed, the chance that the hide is spoiled must be exceeded on a percentage die roll in order for the armor-making process to continue.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The hide must be removed with care, and at this juncture a very sharp edged weapon is essential to trim the hide as cleanly and efficiently as possible. The instrument must be able to be controlled with precision, which means it can’t be any larger than a standard dagger blade. If the character doing the skinning uses a normal (non-magical) blade, there is a 30% chance that, despite his or her best efforts, the hide does not separate cleanly from the body and the resulting scraps of dragon skin are unusable as armor. If an enchanted blade is employed, the chance of failure at this step of the process decreases by 10% for each “plus” of the instrument; thus, with any blade of +3 or greater, successful skinning is assured.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Once the hide is removed and transported to civilization (assuming the dragon wasn’t killed in the village square), the services of skilled armorers, leather-workers, and tailors must be employed to fashion the hide into armor. This process takes 1d10+20 days for each suit of armor, and prices for the needed services are three times the standard rate. Only one set of armor may be fashioned from the hide of a single dragon.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The resulting suit of armor is equivalent to normall scale mail in Armor Class (6), maximum movement rate (6), and bulk (fairly bulky). It weighs about 30 pounds, compared to 40 pounds for normal scale mail. Unenchanted armor can be worn “as is,” but if the nonmagical armor is hit even once by an edged weapon, it cannot be enchanted again.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Enchanting the armor must be done by a magic-user of at least 16th level, who insists on a generous payment in gold pieces, or the promise (and proof) of some other benefit that might be offered. At least half the payment must be supplied in advance, with the rest due when the armor is delivered.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The magic-user must first successfully cast //enchant an item// on the armor, and then apply a second spell (which varies depending on the armor type) to act as a catalyst, triggering the armor’s capability to resist a particular attack form. This second spell must be applied (the casting must have been begun) within 12 hours after the completion of //enchant an item//. If the enchanting process fails, either because the casting of //enchant an item// is unsuccessful or because the second spell is not applied within the required time, the wizard is under no obligation to make another attempt free of charge.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The second step in the process depends on the type (color) of dragon hide used. To complete //white dragon armor//, an //ice storm// spell must be cast on the hide; for //black dragon armor//, the finished hide must be immersed in acid for 1d12+12 hours; to complete //green dragon armor//, a //stinking cloud// spell must be cast on (around) the hide; for //blue dragon armor//, a //shocking grasp spell// is needed, and for //red dragon armor//, //burning hands//. None of these spells or substances damage the armor when they are applied, their function is to activate the innate resistance in the hide that has already been “brought to the surface” by the //enchant an item// spell.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>When the enchantment is complete, the armor is the equivalent to //scale mail +1//: Armor Class 5, movement 9, weight 15 pounds. In addition, each colored armor type affords the wearer resistance or immunity to a particular attack form. The special properties of each type are:</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>//White dragon armor//—Resistance against white dragon breath, winter wolf breath, cone of cold spells, and other attack forms involving cold, ice, or frost.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>//Black dragon armor//—Resistance against black dragon breath, giant slug spittle, anhkheg diges- tive acid, and other attack forms using acid or acid like effects.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>//Green dragon armor//—Resistance against green dragon breath, iron golem breath, cloudkill spells, and other attack forms using poisonous gases.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>//Blue dragon armor//—Resistance against blue dragon breath, lightning bolt spells, storm giant’s lightning attack, and other sorts of natural or magical lightning or electricity.</wrap>\\
</wrap indent>//Red dragon armor//—Resistance against red dragon breath, fireball spells, and other attacks using heat or fire.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>“Resistance” includes these benefits: The wearer of the armor gains +1 on all saving throws against the specified attack form; the wearer is unaffected by any attack of the specified type that does six points of damage or less in a round. In all cases, the wearer is entitled to a-1 modifier on each and every damage die rolled (with a minimum of one point of damage per die). If the application of this modifier reduces damage taken in a round to six points or less, the wearer takes no damage (as stipulated above).</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Although these suits of armor come from evil dragons, priests and fighters of all alignments may wear them.</wrap>

of Fear
**XP Value:** 4,000 **GP Value:** 40,000
Oriental Adventures
This armor looks like normal armor and //detect magic// only reveals that it is magical. However, the armor contains 2d10 //fear// charges when found. Upon uttering the command word, the wearer radiates a //fear// aura to a 30-foot radius. All creatures within that radius must make a saving throw vs. spell or flee in panic for one turn. The wearer is immune to this effect. Each use expends one charge. When all charges are spent, the armor functions as normal armor. It cannot be recharged.

of Fear II
**XP Value:** 3,000 **GP Value:** 30,000
DUNGEON MASTER Guide
This armor functions as normal //plate mail +1//, However, it is imbued with 2d2 fear charges. Upon uttering the command, a charge is spent and the wearer radiates a 30—foot aura of //fear//. All creatures (except the one wearing the armor) must save vs. spell or flee in panic for 1d4+1 rounds. When all charges are spent, the armor functions as normal armor +1. It cannot be recharged.

of Flight
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 7,500
DuNGEoNS & Dracons Rules Cyclopedia
When commanded, the armor creates a //fly// spell effect on the user, which lasts for 12 turns. The user may then travel in the air at up to 360 feet per turn by mere concentration (as the 3rd-level spell).

of Gaseous Form
**XP Value:** 3,000 **GP Value:** 15,000
DuNGEONS & Dracons Rules Cyclopedia
This valuable armor enables the user to turn into a cloud of gas (as the potion of //gaseous form//), including all equipment carried (unlike the potion). The user can remain //gaseous// for up to 6 turns and returns to normal form by mere concentration.

DUNGEONS & DraGons Rules Cyclopedia
When commanded, the armor creates a //haste// spell effect on the user, doubling the normal movement rate and the number of attacks (as the 3rd-level wizard spell). The //haste// lasts for only 1 turn and is usable only once per day.

of Healing
**XP Value:** 10,000 **GP Value:** 80,000
Oriental Adventures
This armor appears to be normal, magical armor. However, once per day, it automatically //heals// the wearer of 2d6 points of damage (whether desired or not). It does this without warning or set time. Each healing takes one charge and the armor has 3d10 charges when found. When all the charges are spent, the armor becomes magical //armor +1//.

Keolish Plate Mail of the Seas
**XP Value:** 1,500 **GP Value:** 7,500
GREYHAWK Adventures
This mail armor was given by the King of Keoland to an admiral who had fought successfully against the Sea Princes. It is //plate mail +1//, and floats in water, negating the chance for its wearer to sink in even slightly choppy water. The wearer can tread water indefinitely, but cannot dive deeper than 2 feet. Swimming speed is not affected by this armor.

Kumakawa
**XP Value:** 300 **GP Value:** 2,000
DRAGON QuEsT* Game
This is a suit of leather armor fashioned from the hide of an owl bear. It has been enchanted with wax from mystical candles. Unlike normal leather armor, which gives its wearer an Armor Class of 7, the Kumakawa provides an Armor Class of 6. Of course, a shield, a high Dexterity score, or magic can improve this even more.

Laeral’s Storm
**XP Value:** 1,800 **GP Value:** 13,500
DRAGON Magazine 39
Named for the wizardess who devised it, //storm armor is plate armor +2//, of a peculiar nonmetallic alloy. It does not conduct electricity, and has the power to transfer heat to and from the surrounding air, so that the wearer remains comfortable during a freezing gale or under the hot desert sun. The wearer is thus unaffected by //fireball//, //ice storm//, or //cone of cold// spells, and immune to electrical damage of any kind. The wearer can stand securely, or move forward at normal speed, in the face of even the most powerful wind (including a magical //gust of wind//). If //storm armor// is struck simultaneously in different areas by spells causing hot and cold (such as //cone of cold// or //chill metal// and //wall of fire// or //heat metal//) it becomes brittle and may be shattered by physical attacks doing at least 9 points of damage. (The character takes all damage inflicted over 9 points.) The armor is only brittle while both hot and cold spells affect it and for one round afterward. When it shatters, it does so thoroughly: a chain reaction occurs in the unstable components of the alloy and the armor disintegrates into useless pieces.

-1:— 1,500
-2:— 3,000
-3:— 4,500
-4:— 6,000
DUNGEON MASTER Guide, 1st Edition
This armor appears to be a normal suit of magical armor (determine type and modifier normally). However, the armor is cursed and actually serves to attract missiles. The wearer is two or three times more likely to be selected as a random missle target than normal. In cases where each person is the target of a set number of missiles (most often in large combats), the wearer has a greater number of missiles fired at him or her. The magical protection of the armor fails when calculated for missile attacks. Its true nature is not revealed until the character is fired upon in earnest—simple experiments (throwing rocks, etc.) do not suffice.

Mourner’s
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** 8,000
Secrets of the Lamp
This suit of lamellar armor is often edged with yellow, gold, red, or other bright colors, but the plates are always black. Individual suits vary from +2 to +4 in enchantment, but all provide complete protection from normal missiles. This armor is the product of the great ghul sha’ir, and its protection is a very mixed blessing. When the wearer suffers 50% or more damage in battle, he or she no longer feels pain. (At this point, the DM should stop telling the armor wearer how much damage the character takes.) All wounds feel trivial.\\
<wrap indent>At 75% or more damage, the wearer is filled with a feeling of invincibility and continues fighting no matter what the odds. The PC is now an NPC for the duration of the battle. If he or she survives, the curse ts still relentless—magical healing is useless on the victim, and only time can heal his wounds. If the PC is slain, he or she does not notice and continues fighting, though any companions may hear his or her bones shattering or see terrible wounds inflicted on the wearer. The victim “lives” for as many days as the character has levels, as his or her trapped life force is consumed by the armor. Neither priest nor wizard spells can be regained, though sha’irs can still request spells. At the end of this time, the PC is irrevocably dead.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Only a //wish// spell or the will of the great ghul sha’ir can undo the curse of //mourners armor// once it has been activated in battle, although some powerful sha’irs are also said to be able to unlock it from the victim’s body. A few great heroes are said to have willingly donned //mourners armor// before a critical battle, adding to their army’s strength with the certain knowledge of their own doom.</wrap>

Oyori of the Unknown Warrior
**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 12,000
POLYHEDRON Newszine 82
This oriental (Kozakuran) //armor +2// has been enchanted to display the family mon (crest) of the wearer. When first found, the armor is stark white. However, when it is put on, it immediately turns black, and the wearer’s family mon appears on the chest plate in the appropriate colors.\\
<wrap indent>If a warrior is killed while wearing the armor, it returns immediately to its white state, the color of death and mourning. The wearer can change the appearance of the armor, allowing the user to pass as another individual or create a disguise. The armor can duplicate any color and mon that the wearer imagines. In order to invoke this power, the wearer must make an Intelligence check at a -3 penalty. The number of hours the armor holds the false image is equal to the wearer’s Intelligence minus the die roll, if successful.</wrap>

Plate of Solamnus
**XP Value:** 5,000 **GP Value:** 20,000
Tales of the Lance
These suits consist of field plate armor that has been beautifully tooled with the markings of all three Solamnic orders. The sigil of the Order of the Rose shows prominently on the breastplate. The suits, made when the Knighthood was first established, have been used by certain Knights of the Rose ever since. Vinas Solamnus wore the first such suit, as did Huma, although he never became a Knight of the Rose. Currently such suits are scarce.\\
<wrap indent>This armor carries a +5 enchantment (AC -3). Wearers must strictly follow the tenets of the lawful good alignment or the armor loses its magical bonus. Neutral or evil characters suffer an additional 1d10 points of damage from any damage received while wearing this armor. DMs must remember that this armor is very rare. It is no longer made. One suit could be the goal of a long, dangerous quest.</wrap>

of Possession
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** 10,000
Oriental Adventures
This armor appears to be a normal suit of magical armor and provides the protection of whatever plus is determined. However, in making the armor the craftsman has invested more than the normal effort. The armor has absorbed or stolen the personality and life force of its maker.\\
<wrap indent>The first time the armor is donned, and once per day thereafter, the DM must secretly roll a saving throw vs. spell for the character wearing the armor. If the saving throw is successful, nothing happens.</wrap>\\
However, if the saving throw fails, the life force contained within the armor successfully //possesses// the character. The //possession// is not a sudden occurrence, but rather a gradual insinuation of the new personality onto the character’s psyche. This takes 3d4 days. At first the change is hardly noticeable—a few odd quirks not evidenced before and a certain possessiveness toward the armor. As the days go by, //possession// becomes stronger and more pronounced. The character leaves old friends as the armorer’s personality takes over. He or she abandons old haunts, roaming the streets searching for places the possessing personality once knew, has memories that do not belong, and refuses to abandon or remove the armor, At the end of the given time period, the character is entirely //possessed// by the armor. As such, the character does not recognize old friends, remember events of his or her own life, or perhaps even the abilities of the character class. He or she may change names, adopt a new alignment, display abilities of a new character class, and the like. If not freed of the possession, the character becomes an NPC under the control of the DM.\\
<wrap indent>The //possession// can be broken by an exorcism spell, which destroys the personality of the armor. Dispel magic releases the character from //possession// long enough to remove the armor, but does not cancel any personality traits the character may have already absorbed. If the possessing influence is destroyed, the armor loses all its magical properties.</wrap>

of Presence
**XP Value:** 3,000 **GP Value:** 30,000
Oriental Adventures
This armor magically bestows on its wearer a dignified and commanding aura. While wearing the armor, a character is treated as if he or she has an 18 Charisma for all encounter reactions. Friendly troops within 120 feet of a wearer have their morale raised by two points. The armor is quite distinctive and only has its effect when visible to others. As such, the character cannot hope to use the powers of the armor and hide unnoticed in a crowd.

DRAGON Magazine 163
The AD&D game has one of the largest compilations of magical items in the fantasy gaming industry. The following tables have been created to add some spice and variety to existing magical items in AD&D game worlds. A table of nonstandard magical item abilities is offered for each major type of magical item in the AD&D game.\\
<wrap indent>Most items are created normally, and they function exactly as a standard item of the same type in the //DMG//. However, sometimes there is a slight mishap in the creation of the device: the steps are not followed in the proper order, the astrological signs do not bode well, the item’s creator is disturbed to begin with, the instructions are incomplete, or something just plain goes wrong. Any of these results may cause a magical item to behave differently from others just like it.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Not all quirks are bad, however. Some are detrimental to the item or its user, some are neutral, and some are even beneficial. The possibility of quirks existing (and the actual number of quirks) is determined by using the table below to determine the exact quirks that the magical armor possesses.</wrap>

^ Roll ^ Quirks Present |
| 01-86 | No quirks |
| 87-94 | One quirk |
| 95-98 | Two quirks |
| 99-00 | Three quirks |

^ Roll ^ Result |
| 01-06 | Armor is incredibly shiny and reflects light of any kind; furthermore, any creature using a gaze attack within 10 feet of the armor has a 75% chance ofseeing its own reflection. |
| 07-11 | Armor is heavy; add 25% to its total weight and encumbrance. |
| 12-16 | Armor is tight-fitting; if not oiled at least once every three days, the suit cramps the wearer’s fighting skills. Asa result, the wearer suffers a -1 penalty on all reaction, attack, and damage rolls until the armor is oiled. |
| 17-21 | Armor works normally but appears incredibly beaten and battered. No amount of repair can change its appearance. (Status-conscious cavaliers and paladins do have reservations about wearing armor that does not look good.) |
| 22-26 | Armor is silent; the wearer does not clank loudly if the armor is metal. Note that this does not mean that the wearer can move silently; the armor simply makes no noise. |
| 27-32 | Armor glows with the light of a //faerie fire// spell. Only continual darkness can negate this radiation (and then for six turns plus one turn per level of the caster). If the armor is covered by clothing, the glow still shines through. |
| 33-37 | Armor weighs ¼ as much as normal armor of the same type. |
| 38-43 | Armor lacks magical protective ability against 1d4 specific types of creatures.
| 44-48 |Armor is resistant to fire; it can never be burned or melted by normal or magical fire. |
| 49-53 | Armor has an “Achilles’ heel;” every time the wearer is hit, there is a 5% chance that the “heel” is hit and double damage is done to the wearer. |
| 54-59 | Armor does not magically expand or contract to fit any size wearer. Roll 1d6+3 to determine height of the humanoid figure that can use the armor. Anyone within 1 foot of the size can use the armor. |
| 60-64 |Armor is attuned to a place of special magical radiance, in much the same manner as //drow armor// (See **Drow Treasure**). If the armor is not exposed to this place once every 30 days, its magic is lost. |
| 65-70 | Armor has complicated straps and is hard to put on and remove. Conse- quently, the time required to put on and take off the armor is increased by 10 rounds. |
| 71-74 | Armor can not be scratched, stained, or dented. |
| 75-78 | Armor has an inherent disruption of magic. While its wearer enjoys a +1 bonus on saving throws vs. spell, spells cannot be cast if he or she is a multiclassed wizard or a spell—using ranger or paladin. |
| 79-84 | Armor attracts monsters; any random encounter checks are at double the normal chance for anyone wearing this armor. |
| 85-89 | Armor is a superconductor of heat and electricity; add +1 hp per die to all damage from fire or electricity. |
| 90-94 | Armor does not provide magical protection if clothing or a covering is worn over it. |
| 95-98 | Armor is an exquisite piece of workmanship and commands a price of 150% over normal prices due to its quality. |
| 99-00 | Armor is possessed by a spirit of random alignment; if the wearer’s alignment differs from the spirit’s, the armor periodically attempts to possess the wearer. Determine the chance of success as noted under the 5th-level wizard spell, //magic jar//. The spirit’s intelligence can be determined by rolling 3d6. The chance of a possession attempt occurring is 15% per week, cumulative. |

of Rage
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** 1,500
DUNGEON MASTER Guide, 1st Edition
This armor is identical in appearance to //armor of command// and functions as a suit of //armor +1//. However, when worn, the armor causes the character to suffer a -3 penalty to all encounter checks. All friendly troops within 360 feet have their morale lowered by -2. The effect is not noticeable to the wearer or those affected (characters do not immediately notice that the armor is the cause of their problems).

Rainbow
**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 12,500
POLYHEDRON Newszine 43
Only a couple of suits of this incredible chain mail are known to exist, and those few are handed down from clan leader to successor. They are given by the Norse bridge guardian, Heimdall, to his followers for exceptional deeds performed in the deity’s name. //Rainbow armor// takes the form of multicolored, shimmering chain mail, enchanted to a bonus of +3. The armor glows with a radiance that illuminates a 20-foot surrounding area, negating magical //darkness// and the ability to hide in shadows. Even invisible objects are revealed within this radius by the thin aura of rainbow light that outlines them. The mail is extremely light, encumbering the wearer only as much as elven chainmail.

Raji’s Armor of the Desert Evening
**XP Value:** 500 **GP Value:** 5,000
1992 Fantasy Collector Card 298
Raji’s magical armor is unusual for the land of Zakhara—tt is a suit of banded, rather than lamellar, armor. Like other forms of //armor of the desert evening//, this magical armor does not provide additional bonuses to Armor Class, but it can be worn in the desert heat without ill effect. Raji believes that this armor was originally made for an outland warrior from some country that is more accustomed to banded mail armor.

Red Armor of the Hellfurnaces
**XP Value:** 6,000 **GP Value:** 35,000
GREYHAWK Adventures
This blood-red armor was cut from the back plates of an adult red dragon, Many warriors from the Yeomanry died in the battle to kill the creature, and the best dwarven armorers were hired to rework the plates into a wearable suit. The final product is a set of plate mail +4 that allows its wearer to save against fire—based attacks for half or no damage. Red dragons who see this armor make unusual efforts to kill the wearer.

Red Dragon Scale Mail
**XP Value:** 2,500 **GP Value:** 12,500
DRAGON Magazine 39
Made from the scales of a huge old red dragon, this mail is AC 1. Like all magical armor, it is virtually weightless. It covers the body from neck to foot, being worn just like a normal suit of scale mail. Normal weapons employed against the mail do only half damage if a hit is scored. Magical weapons of +1 or better do full damage. The mail provides protection of +3 against all fire-based attacks and the breath weapons of all dragons, with the following exceptions—it cannot protect its wearer against the sonic blast of a platinum dragon, and it does not protect against any breath weapon employed by a red dragon.

of Reflection
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 5,000
DunGeons & Dracons Rules Cyclopedia
If a //light// or //continual light// spell is cast at the user, the armor automatically reflects it back at the caster, who must make a saving throw vs. spell or be //blinded// (as in the respective spell descriptions). The item reflects up to three spells per day. In addition, when the user is in melee against a creature with a gaze attack, the chances of gaze reflection are the same as if a mirror were held, but without the -2 penalty to the user’s attack rolls (which represents the awkwardness of holding the mirror and attempting to attack at the same time).

Remove Curse
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 7,500
DunGEons & DRAGONS Rules Cyclopedia
This armor cannot be cursed when found. When commanded, the item creates a //remove curse// spell effect on the user only as if a 36th-level caster (automatically removing one curse). Note: This item functions for a total of three times, at a maximum rate of once per day. After its three charges are used, no other special abilities remain and it cannot be recharged; the item does remain magical, however, regardless of spent charges.

Scale Mail of Horus
**XP Value:** 3,500 **GP Value:** 25,000
Old Empires
This armor is //scale mail +4//. It is the equivalent of AC 2, and also gives the wearer resistance to all fire and lightning attacks (fire and lightning attacks automatically inflict ½-damage, ¼-damage if the saving throw is successful).

Skoriaan’s Drow Chain Mail
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** 5,000
1993 Collector Card 466
Skoriaan believes that his chain mail affords magical protection, while in reality it has been cursed to serve no better than normal human mail. What’s worse, Skoriaan’s ex-lover had a special magical spell placed upon it that allows her to track Skoriaan wherever he may run. Up until this point, Skoriaan has believed that his spurned lover’s minions have been lucky in finding him, but he finally is beginning to suspect that something is not quite right.

of Solamnia
**XP Value:** 3,000 **GP Value:** 15,000
Tales of the Lance
All Knights of Solamnia gain a suit of this armor when they attain the title of Lord and prove themselves worthy as true and noble knights. Each suit is engraved with the symbols of the knight’s order and (for Sword and Rose Knights) those of any previously held knighthood. Production of Solamnic armor resumed in the aftermath of the War of the Lance. The armor is a suit of //field plate +1//.

Surtr’s Iron
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** —
Legends & Lore
Any being touching this red-hot iron armor suffers 1d10 damage. The person in the armor is immune to its effects.

of Swimming*
**XP Value:** +700 **GP Value:** +3,500
DRAGON Magazine 179
This lamellar armor allows its user to move through water as if unencumbered. It does not convey water breathing abilities nor the swimming proficiency, but it does allow the individual to float and swim if he or she is otherwise capable.

of Temperature Control*
**XP Value:** +500 **GP Value:** +2,500
DRAGON Magazine 181
//Armor of temperature control// may be worn without any discomfort due to cold or heat, and enables its wearer to operate in the coldest or hottest of natural environments (-40 to 150° F). Note that the temperatures must be due to the weather and not to any attack by fire, cold, magic, or monstrous abilities; the armor does not give fire or frost resistance. At the DM’s option, the armor can give protection against the natural environments of the Paraelemental Plane of Ice or the Elemental Plane of Fire. Remember no extra protection is given in combat.

Tulen’s Plate Mail of Etherealness
**XP Value:** 5,000 **GP Value:** 25,000
1992 Fantasy Collector Card 26
Tulen’s //armor +5// can be recharged, but only by a 15th- or higher level wizard. It allows Tulen and anyone who touches the armor to go into the Ethereal Plane. Other people who ride along on the armor’s power stay in the plane up to five hours after touching it. but Tulen may remain ethereal indefinitely! This light gray armor never loses its magical AC bonus no matter how many ethereal charges it is reduced to. The armor also glows brightly when ethereal creatures approach within 20 feet.

of the Undead
**XP Value:** 1,500 **GP Value:** 15,000
POLYHEDRON Newszine 43
Created and once worn by the infamous Thorines of Thessla, this suit of armor consists of the bones of many creatures, bound together by ligaments and metal hinges to allow movement. It only can be safely worn by a lawful evil character. All others find it cannot be made to fit them, regardless of their size. It confers AC 3, and radiates a //protection from good 10' radius//. If worn by a priest, it raises the individual’s effective experience level by 2, but only to turn or befriend undead.

of Underwater Action
**XP Value:** 1,400 P Value: 7,000
POLYHEDRON Newszine 82
Found only as chain mail or plate mail, this armor is always airtight and keeps its wearer dry and comfortable.

The suit allows the wearer to swim 180 feet per round, provided he or she has a swimming proficiency.

Voice of Heroes
**XP Value:** 6,000 **GP Value:** 32,000
DRAGON Magazine 16
This is //armor +5//, but it weighs just 3 pounds.

of Vulnerability
**XP Value** **GP Value**
-1:— 1,500
-2:— 3,000
-3:— 4,500
-4:— 6,000
GREYHAWK
This armor seems to be genuine, magical armor with a protection factor of +1 to +4—but the factor is actually -1 to -4. The vulnerability of such armor is not revealed until an enemy strikes a blow in anger at its wearer.

of Vulnerability II
**XP Value** **GP Value**
-1:— 1,500
-2:— 3,000
-3:— 4,500
DUNGEON MASTER Guide, 1st Edition
This appears to every test to be magical //plate mail +1//, //+2//, or //+3//, but it is actually //cursed armor -2//, //-3//, or //-4//. The armor’s great vulnerability is not apparent until an enemy successfully strikes a blow in anger with desire and intent to kill the wearer. The armor falls to pieces whenever an opponent strikes the wearer with an unmodified attack roll of 20.

of Warmth
**XP Value:** 250 **GP Value:** 1,250
DRAGON Magazine 181
//Armor of warmth// may be worn without any discomfort due to cold, and enables its wearer to operate in the coldest of natural environments (20 to -40° F) as well as in a temperate climate. Note that the temperatures must be due to the weather and not to any attack by cold, magic, or monstrous abilities; the armor does not give frost resistance. At the DM’s option, it can give protection against the natural environments of the Paraelemental Plane of Ice.

White Armor of the Griff Mountains
**XP Value:** 2,250 **GP Value:** 13,500
GREYHAWK Adventures
After tribesmen of the Griff Mountains slew an adult white dragon, they sold the hide to dwarven armorers who created this suit of //scale mail +3//. The dwarves created it for a human—sized wearer, but a dwarf or halfling can wear it at a penalty of -1l to Armor Class; the total AC modifier is +2. The armor allows the user to save vs. cold-based attacks for half or no damage.

===== Armor Bath =====
**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 10,000
New Item
This extremely rare item appears as a 5-foot tall, 6-foot long, claw-footed cauldron made of a metal and ceramic mix. The rim of the cauldron is inlaid with sandalwood, upon which are carved runes of an ancient language. If someone can read the language, they can decipher the message as reading, “To protect one from grievous harms and render oneself immune to the ordinary hurts of the world.”\\
<wrap indent>If //blessed// (or //cursed//, depending on the alignment of the user) //water// fills the bath, it can confer great power upon the bather. In short, it places an //invisible armor//, harder than steel, over body parts immersed in the water. The armor is completely impervious to ordinary weapons and attacks, and grants an effective AC 0 against magical weapons for the affected area. Creatures that are magical in nature are assumed to be as magical weapons, so they attack against AC 0. Damage-causing spells that are not directly cast at the armored individual (such as //fireballs// not directly centered on the character) cause no damage to the armored parts of the body, though unarmored parts suffer ordinary damage.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>There are several disadvantages to this armor. First, it can never be removed. Second, it robs the affected area of all feeling, so tasks that require the tactile skills of a covered area cannot be performed. In addition to losing all feeling in the area, the bathed part loses flexibility, able to move only in a limited fashion.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Third, and most dangerous, if a person using the bath applies the bath’s armor to more than 50% of a body, the individual dies. There is no save against this effect. Thus, those who know the full effects of the bath use it only sparingly, covering only their necks, forearms, chest, and the like. They are always careful to restrict how much they place on themselves, knowing that too much can kill them.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Some call this the //bath of death//. There is some speculation that it was created by dark gods, or fashioned by priests at the behest of gods who needed secret and near-invulnerable assassins for their evil works.</wrap>

===== Arrow =====
When a magical arrow misses its target, there is a 50% chance that it breaks or is otherwise rendered useless. A magical arrow that hits its target is destroyed unless otherwise specified in its description.\\
<wrap indent>After determining the magical properties of the arrow acquired, roll on the following table to determine the type of arrow. Note: Quarrels and bolts are crossbow missiles.</wrap>

Abaris’s
**XP Value:** 200 **GP Value:** 2,000
DunGeons & DRAGONS Master Set
Abaris the Hyperborean, a Greek sage in the 6th Century B. C. E., once received a magic arrow from the god Apollo (according to Greek legend). The arrow enabled him to become //invisible//, //cure disease//, //fly// (riding the arrow; MV 60, MC C), and divine the future.

Acid
**XP Value:** 30 **GP Value:** 75
POLYHEDRON Newszine 47
Found in caches of 1d6, these +1 oddities are highly valued, They transform themselves into a spray of acid when fired, doing 2d6 points of damage to the target, and soaking everything within 15 feet of the point of impact with acid (items must save vs. acid or be destroyed).

of Aggravation
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** 100
DRAGON Magazine 135
This cursed arrow infuriates any being it hits, granting its victim a bonus of +2 on attack and damage rolls as well as on saving throws, but causing the victim to lose one point of Armor Class. These effects last for 1d6 turns, during which time the target does everything in its power to slay the archer. The arrow does no damage at all to its victim.

Antimagic
**XP Value:** 60 **GP Value:** 360
DRAGON Magazine 135
This magical arrow grants a +2 bonus on attack rolls but causes no damage if the target is struck. Instead, the arrow negates all magic within a 10-foot radius of the target for 3d10 rounds. (If the arrow misses its target, the area of effect is centered on the first thing the arrow hits.) All magical items in the area of effect, except for artifacts and relics, are rendered inert for the duration of the arrow’s effect. All spells cast by, on, and around the target are dispelled, regardless of the caster’s level. Illusions of all sorts are likewise nullified. Spellcasters are also unable to cast any spells for the duration of the effect of this arrow. Note that the arrow’s effect causes the target, and the area of effect around it, to be rendered immune to magic. Therefore, //fireballs//, //magic missiles//, and the like do not cause any damage to the target, nor to anyone within 10 feet. Only one such arrow may be found at a time.

Apollo’s
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** —
Legends & Lore
Anyone struck by an arrow of Apollo’s avatar must save vs. death magic or become instantly ill, suffering a loss of 1d10 points per round until a //cure disease// spell is cast upon the victim.

of Attraction
**XP Value:** 100 **GP Value:** 400
The Complete Book of Elves
//Attracted arrows//, if they hit, cannot be removed from the victim’s body until //dispel magic// is cast upon the person. Meanwhile, the arrow begins to fester within the wound, causing infection and even death in the unfortunate being.

of Biting
**XP Value:** 100 **GP Value:** 500
Dunceons & Dracons Rules Cyclopedia
When this missile hits it turns into a poisonous snake. In addition to normal damage, the victim must make a saving throw vs. poison or die (or, at the DM’s choice, take extra damage; 2d6, 2d10, or 2d20 are recommended amounts).

Black Arrow of Luz
**XP Value:** 750 **GP Value:** 7,500
GREYHAWK Adventures
Carved from the bone of a black dragon, this enchanted arrow strikes with a +3 attack and damage modifier. The arrow reappears in the owner’s quiver each dawn after it is used—this item is permanent unless lost to a special attack form or deliberately destroyed. Once a day, an archer can call upon its deadly powers, causing the target to save vs. death magic or die immediately.\\
<wrap indent>Good-aligned characters save at -2. This power must be summoned before the arrow is fired, and a miss wastes its magic for that day.</wrap>

of Blinding
**XP Value:** 20 **GP Value:** 120
DRAGON Magazine 135
When this arrow hits a target, it explodes in a flash of light that blinds everyone within 60 feet for 2d6 turns unless a saving throw vs. breath weapon is made. The archer must be outside the area of effect to avoid being blinded.

of Blinking
**XP Value:** 200 **GP Value:** 600
Dunceons & Dracons Rules Cyclopedia
A missile with this talent cannot hit any friends of the user, “blinking” in and out of existence until it reaches an enemy. (If the sight of the enemy is blocked by friends, a penalty may apply to the attack roll.)

Bolts of Lightning
**XP Value:** 200 **GP Value:** 1,200
DRAGON Magazine 127
Also called //thunder bolts//, these //bolts// appear to be normal bolts until fired from a crossbow. After being fired, a //bolt of lightning// becomes a 7-foot bolt of //lightning// with a range equal to the maximum range of the bow that fired it (a bolt fired from a heavy crossbow has a range of 240 yards, and a //bolt// fired from a light crossbow 180 yards).\\
<wrap indent>These //bolts// grant a +2 bonus on attack rolls and cause 4d4 hp of damage if they strike a target. A save vs. spell is applicable; if the save is successful, only half damage accrues to the creature struck. Furthermore, all creatures within a 15-foot radius of where this magical //bolt// hits must save vs. petrification or be stunned for one round due to the ear-piercing clash of thunder which accompanies the strike.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>//Bolts of lightning// are usually found in quantities of 2d4. They are also often found mixed with normal bolts or with magical bolts of other types.</wrap>

of Bow-Breaking
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** 100
DRAGON Magazine 135
This arrow breaks any bow used to fire it, unless the bow makes a successful saving throw vs. crushing blow at -4.

of Burning
**XP Value:** 100 **GP Value:** 600
DRAGON Magazine 135
All creatures are considered to be AC 10 against this arrow, although creatures with a high dexterity receive their Armor Class bonus. With any successful attack roll, the arrow engulfs the target in a flaming shroud that does 4d6 hp damage (no save), affecting only the victim and a 1-foot radius around him for one round. Creatures that are touching the target when the arrow strikes may make a saving throw vs. spell for half damage. All equipment on the victim must save vs. magical fire at -2. An //arrow of burning// may be used to burn through an average-sized dungeon door in 1d4+1 rounds.

of Charming
**XP Value:** 800 **GP Value:** 2,000
DunGceons & DraGons Rules Cyclopedia
The victim must make a saving throw vs. spell or be charmed by the user (as the charm person and charm monster wizard spells).

of Charming II
**XP Value:** 800 **GP Value:** 2,000
DRAGON Magazine 91
An item often made by priests of Aphrodite, this arrow has a +3 bonus to attack, but causes no damage to the being struck by it. Any human, demihuman, or humanoid hit by an //arrow of charming// is affected as if the one who fired the arrow had cast a //charm person// spell. The feelings of the //charmed// figure develop quickly into infatuation and then love if the one who fired the missile is of the same race or species and of the opposite sex. No saving throw is allowed at first against the effect, though the //charm// does wear off over time (see the description of the druid spell charm person or mammal). A detect charm spell notes the arrow’s influence, and a successful //dispel magic// cast against 12th-level magic removes the charm.\\
<wrap indent>The arrow only affects creature types that are susceptible to //charm person// spells. It can only be used once. Once the //arrow// strikes its target, it disappears. If the arrow misses its intended target, it vanishes. If it hits a creature that cannot be //charmed// by it, the arrow disappears with no effect, just as if it had missed the target.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>An //arrow of charming// is always red in color, with a heart-shaped arrowhead. Note that other sorts of magical arrows may strongly resemble this one. //Arrows of charming// are always found singly.</wrap>

of Clairaudience
**XP Value:** 20 **GP Value:** 120
DRAGON Magazine 135
This arrow gives the archer the ability to hear sounds within range of the arrow’s location. Like the //arrow of clairvoyance//, this arrow Is activated by saying the command word (“Listen!”) and shooting the arrow. The archer is then able to hear sounds from the arrow’s location by covering his ears and concentrating. Sounds within a 15-foot radius around the arrow may be heard in this manner. This arrow can “hear” anything louder than regular breathing. The range is 240 yards, and its duration (once the arrow is fired) is six turns.

of Clairvoyance
**XP Value:** 20 **GP Value:** 120
DraGON Magazine 135
This arrow gives its user the ability to see an area from the location of the arrow. The field of vision is equal to the archer’s normal field, and activates by sounding the command word (“Vision!”) and firing the arrow. The archer is then able to see the area in front of the arrowhead by closing his or her eyes and concentrating. Normal restrictions for distance of vision apply with this magical arrow. In addition to normal vision, the arrow grants //infravision//, limited to a 10-foot radius around the arrow’s location. The range of the //clairvoyance// is 240 yards, and its duration (once the arrow is fired) is six turns.

of Climbing
**XP Value:** 300 **GP Value:** 500
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Rules Cyclopedia
This talent only functions if the missile is fired at an object. The missile securely fastens itself to any object it strikes and creates a magical 50-foot rope, issuing from the point of entry. The rope supports any weight of climbers and disappears one turn later or upon command of the user. The missile cannot be moved after it hits, and it disappears with the rope.

of Connection
**XP Value:** 50 **GP Value:** 300
POLYHEDRON Newszine 82
When fired, this arrow creates a magically supported rope extending from whatever the arrow hit to the archer’s location, up to a maximum of 300 feet. The rope appears to float in midair and can support up to 3,000 pounds at one time. The rope is indestructible and lasts for 24 hours unless the archer releases it earlier with a command. When the rope expires or is released, both it and the arrow disappear.

of Curing
**XP Value:** 200 **GP Value:** 500
DunGEons & DRaAGoNs Rules Cyclopedia
This missile is blunt, and inscribed with a holy symbol. When it hits a living creature, it inflicts no damage. Instead, it cures 2d6 points of damage plus 2 extra points for each magical bonus of the missile. For example, if a 5 is rolled for a curing arrow +2, the total points of damage cured are 9.

of Darkness
**XP Value:** 100 **GP Value:** 500
The Complete Book of Elves
These are among the most permanent and commonly used of all the enspelled arrows. If a //continual darkness// spell is cast upon the shaft of an arrow, it can then be used to //blind// an enemy. These arrows are common among elf scouts, who carry them sheathed until there is a use for them.

of Detonation
**XP Value:** 200 **GP Value:** 2,000
POLYHEDRON Newszine 82
When fired, this arrow flies very slowly, moving only 5 feet per round. It travels up to 300 feet before falling to the ground. Each arrow has two command words, and any time during an arrow’s course, the archer may speak one of the words, causing the arrow to either explode in a burst of light or to erupt into a ball of flame. The first effect is the same as a //continual light// spell except that it creates a globe of bright light that illuminates a 100-foot radius. The second effect is a //fireball// that causes 5d6 points of damage to all in a 50-foot radius, save vs. spell for ½ damage.

of Direction
**XP Value:** 2,500 **GP Value:** 17,500
DUNGEON MASTER Guide
This typically appears to be a normal arrow. However, its magical properties make it function like a //locate object// spell, allowing the arrow to show the direction to the nearest stairway, pas- sage, cave or another specific location.\\
<wrap indent>Once per day the device can be tossed into the air, it falls and points in the requested direction. This process can be repeated seven times during the next seven turns. The request must be for one of the following:<\wrap>\\
* Stairway (up or down)
* Sloping passage (up or down)
* Dungeon exit or entrance
* Cave or cavern
<wrap indent>Requests must be given by distance (nearest, farthest, highest, lowest) or by direction (north, south, east, west).

of Disarmin
**XP Value:** 400 **GP Value:** 700
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Rules Cyclopedia
This arrow only functions if the victim is holding a weapon or other item. The victim must make a saving throw vs. spell or drop the item. A dropped item may be normally recovered in | round (unless that is impossible).

of Disintegration
**XP Value:** 60 **GP Value:** 360
Dracon Magazine 135
This arrow is +1 to attack but has -4 on its saving throws. The arrow’s effect is the same as the 6th-level magic-user spell //disintegrate//, except that it does not affect targets of a magical nature. The effects of the arrow also differ from the spell in that only nonliving material, up to 20 cubic feet in volume, may be obliterated. If the arrow misses its target, nothing is //disintegrated// and the arrow turns to dust. If a living victim is struck by this arrow, the victim takes normal damage (1d6 hit points) but can only be healed by magical spells, potions, or powers; normal healing is ineffective.\\
<wrap indent>The //arrow of disintegration// is made of a long shaft of oak with a lodestone arrowhead. The flights are usually made from the feathers of rare birds. Often, magical words are inscribed on the shaft; these must be repeated before the arrow is fired. Only one such arrow may be found at a time.</wrap>

of Dispelling
**XP Value:** 200 **GP Value:** 400
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Rules Cyclopedia
When a missile with this talent hits, it creates a //dispel magic// effect centered on the point of impact (a 20-foot-cube) as if cast by a 1Sth-level caster.

Distance
**XP Value:** 25 **GP Value:** 150
DRAGON Magazine 135
When loosed, this arrow has a range equal to twice that of a normal arrow, depending upon the type of bow used to fire the arrow. This extended range does not, however, affect distances of short and medium range, so all distances beyond normal are considered long range. The arrow has a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls.

of Draconian Slaying
**XP Value:** 250 **GP Value:** 2,500
Dwarven Kingdoms of Krynn
These arrows serve as normal //arrows of slaying//, but against all types of draconians. Note: These arrows only exist in the DRAGONLANCE(c) campaign world of Ansalon.

Elven
**XP Value:** 20 **GP Value:** |20
The Elves of Alfheim
//Elven arrows// are made from the limbs of the //tree of life//; the stone points are tempered in the sap of the //tree of life//. Since both superfluous branches and sap come available only a few times ina decade, elven arrows are rare.\\
<wrap indent>They are unique in that they have no pluses (unless they are further enchanted), but they are permanently magical. The arrow always counts as a magical weapon, affecting creatures that can only be affected by magic. There is a 10% chance the arrow breaks after each time it is used. The cost of an elven arrow in human markets is usually around 1,000 gp.<wrap>\\
<wrap indent>These arrows are only used for special missions. Elven army archers who know they may be facing enchanted monsters generally have one or two in their quivers along with their usual non-magical stone or metal-tipped arrows.</wrap>

of Enchantment
**XP Value:** 20 **GP Value:** 120
DRAGON Magazine 181
These magical arrows possess a dweomer that allows them to penetrate the magical defenses of creatures that can be struck only by enchanted weapons. No bonuses for attacks or damage occur; such a weapon has the same chance to hit a highly magical monster as an ordinary arrow has to hit a normal, flesh-and-blood creature, doing as much damage as a regular arrow.\\
<wrap indent>Missile weapons are a bit different. Actual //missiles of enchantment// (bolts, arrows, sling bullets, etc.) are the same as melee weapons, However, bows, crossbows, and //slings of enchantment// cast a magical aura on any mundane ammunition with which they are loaded (no extra bonus for using //missiles// and //bows of enchantment// together).</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>For all weapons of enchantment, the XP cost is that of a regular +1 version of that weapon type, or whatever other official magical weapon exists of that type that is of low value. These weapons do not lose their abilities when taken to other planes, and the missile launchers can provide their owners with a virtually unlimited supply of “magical” missiles. Just remember that the damage done is the same as for ordinary weapons. The magic doesn’t add to the weapon’s attack capabilities; it negates a monster’s defensive capabilities.</wrap>

of Explosions
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** 500
DRAGON Magazine 135
When nocked into a bow, this arrow explodes into a 6 HD //fireball// (as if cast by a 6th-level wizard).
There is no saving throw against the effect, and the personal possessions the archer carries must save vs. magical fire at -4.

of Extended Range
**XP Value:** 100 **GP Value:** 600
The Complete Book of Elves
There are three versions of this arrow, which allow the user to double, triple, or even quadruple the normal ranges for any type of bow, The first version allows for a double range, it is the one encountered about 60% of the time. The triplerange version is found about 30% of the time, and the quadruple-range arrow is met only 10% of the time.\\
<wrap indent>Although these arrows do not have an attack bonus, they are effective against creatures that are immune to all but magical weapons (up to +1). In addition, the arrows cancel out the normal range modifiers of the bow, using instead the modified, multiplied range for purposes of figuring modifiers. //Arrows of extended// range are usually found in groups of 2d10.</wrap>

Faerie Fire
**XP Value:** 20 **GP Value:** 120
DRAGON Magazine 135
This arrow covers any human-size or smaller creature it hits with //faerie fire//, as the 1st-level priest spell. The spell lasts 12 rounds. Normal damage is also done to the victim.

of Fire
**XP Value:** 40 **GP Value:** 240
DRAGON Magazine 135
This arrow immediately bursts into flame after being fired. An //arrow of fire// does normal damage plus 1d6 hp fire damage to any creature it hits. Creatures native to the Plane of Elemental Fire are immune to the fire damage, but cold-dwelling creatures take +2 hp damage from this arrow. Any clothing worn by the victim must make a saving throw vs. normal fire or be destroyed.

Fire Seed
**XP Value:** 200 **GP Value:** 500
The Complete Book of Elves
Like the //fire trap arrow//, this one requires a special, hollow pottery tip, wherein the //fire seeds// are placed. When the arrow strikes the target, the seeds detonate, inflicting 2d8 points of damage to all within 10 feet of where the arrow falls. If the arrow hits someone, the victim suffers 1d4 points of damage, as well as the 2d8 points from the //fire seed//; the victim doesn’t even get a saving throw to take only half damage.

Fire Trap
**XP Value:** 300 **GP Value:** 700
The Complete Book of Elves
By casting a //fire trap// spell on a tiny and delicate box, then sealing this box inside a special, fragile arrowhead, an elf priest can create an effective //flame arrow//. In theory, when the arrow hits a firm enough target (anything harder than water), it triggers the spell, engulfing its target in a sudden blaze of flame. In game terms, the head and box must make a single saving throw against crushing blow (as pottery) in order for the fire trap to detonate. Otherwise, the arrow is a dud, though it could possibly be reused against the archer.\\
<wrap indent>The damage caused by this arrow is 1d4+1 plus the variable damage caused by the //fire trap//. Even if the arrow misses its target, it still creates a conflagration in the area if the head cracks open.</wrap>

Flaming
**XP Value:** 20 **GP Value:** 60
POLYHEDRON Newszine 47
These //magical arrows +2// are found in caches of 2d6. When fired, they burst into flame, doing an additional 1d6 points of damage to the target, and set fire to all flammables within 3 feet of the point of impact.

of Flying
**XP Value:** 500 **GP Value:** 750
DuNGEONS & DRAGONS Rules Cyclopedia
A missile with this talent can be fired at ranges five times greater than normal. If the missile weapon firing this arrow is also magical and has an additional range multiplier, the effect is cumulative; multiply each maximum range by five, If the missile weapon is not magical, use the maxi- mum ranges.

of Force
**XP Value:** 80 **GP Value:** 480
DRAGON Magazine 135
This arrow causes the struck creature to make a saving throw vs. spell at -3. If the save is unsuccessful, the creature is encased in a //forcecage// for three turns (see the 7th-level wizard spell for details). Due to its high degree of power, the //arrow of force// provides a -3 penalty on attack rolls. No damage is done to the victim.

of Harm
**XP Value:** 80 **GP Value:** 480
DRAGON Magazine 135
This arrow does double normal damage to one specified type of creature. If used on any creature other than that specified for the arrow’s use, normal damage is done to the target. The following table lists the most basic types of creatures for which //arrows of harm// are created. At the DM’s discretion, other monsters and demihuman races may be added.

^ Roll ^ Creature type |
| 1 | Aquatic creatures |
| 2 | Tanar’ri, Yugoloth, and Baatezu |
| 3 | Demihumans |
| 4 | Dragons |
| 5 | Elementals |
| 6 | Giants |
| 7 | Lycanthropes |
| 8 | Undead |

of Holding
**XP Value:** 50 **GP Value:** 300
DRAGON Magazine 135
This mystical arrow is inscribed with strange runes. When it hits its target, the target must make a saving throw vs. spell or freeze as if affected by a //hold// spell. The effect lasts for 2d4 rounds. The victim takes no other damage.

of Holding II
**XP Value:** 50 **GP Value:** 100
The Ruins of Undermountain
These finely made arrows are usually crafted by elves, but the secrets of their manufacture are known to a few craftsmen of all races. Such arrows count as magical weapons when determining what they can strike, but they provide no combat bonuses of any sort.\\
<wrap indent>The strike of an //arrow of holding// does only one point of damage, but these arrows pierce any armor. On striking, the arrow vanishes in a pulse of silvery radiance, and the target creature must save vs. spell at -4 or suffer the effects of a //hold person// spell for 5+1d4 rounds. All types of creatures can be affected, and an //arrow of holding// even affects levitating, self-animating, or otherwise mobile dweomered items, freezing them in one relative place. (If an //arrow of holding// misses, it may be retrieved for reuse.) A typical treasure hoard holds 1d6 //arrows of holding//.</wrap>

Ice
**XP Value:** 10 **GP Value:** 50
POLYHEDRON Newszine 47
Crafted of solid steel, these arrows radiate alteration magic and are cold to the touch. When fired, they transform themselves into 18 inch icicles that do an additional 1d6 damage to fire-using or fire-dwelling creatures. They have no magical bonus. They are found in catches of 1d8.

of Illumination
**XP Value:** 30 **GP Value:** 180
POLYHEDRON Newszine 82
When fired, this arrow //levitates// to a point 3 feet above the archer’s head. The arrow follows the archer as he or she travels, adjusting its height if the ceiling lowers. The arrow glows with the equivalent of a //light// spell and functions for 24 turns or until it is broken. Usually 2d4 of these arrows are found together.

Illusory Missiles
**XP Value:** 10 **GP Value:** 100
DraGON Magazine 181
There are //illusory missiles// of various types to complement illusory weapons and armor. Illusory sticks and stones are tiny things, totally useless in battle—normally. When the command word is spoken, however, a faintly visible magical field surrounds them, stretching them out to the proportions of regular javelins, arrows, or sling bullets. Although the field does no damage itself, it is substantial enough to enable the missile to be handled and used with a blowgun, bow, sling, or spear thrower. If the enemy sees one of these coming, the foe will probably assume the worst and take damage equivalent to that of an ordinary missile, but it’s all show. These devices are usable only once.

of Justice
**XP Value:** 200 **GP Value:** 400
The Five Shires
All shire sheriffs carry 1d8 //arrows of justice// in their boots or thrust through their belts. The arrows remain inactive in the hands of anyone but a halfling. When cast by a halfling at a vis- ible target, an //arrow of justice// flashes unerringly to strike the creature as a //magic missile//, following it around obstructions and through changes in direction to any range, within one round.\\
<wrap indent>The touch of an //arrow of justice// may deal 2d6 points of damage (save vs. spell allows half damage), or merely root the subject to the spot (held for 1d4+1 rounds, with no save), as its hurler desires. It may be mentally commanded to cause both effects when it is released. If not commanded, it always deals damage. If the target is an illusion, the arrow simply falls from the caster’s hand to the ground, unused and inactivated. Upon striking a target, an //arrow of justice// vanishes forever.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>A creature struck by an //arrow of justice// glows with a silvery radiance for 3d6 rounds. This effect foils attempts to hide in shadows, mingle with other creatures, or use //invisibility//, but //dispel magic// cancels the arrow’s effect.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Hin masters and keepers construct these items in secrecy under the guidance of certain human wizards, and sheriffs hide caches of replacements in handy places about the shires. No hin would dare to move or take a discovered //arrow of justice//, unless fellow hin are endangered and the arrow might aid them—the hin would then act and trust to the wisdom and mercy of the sheriffs to avoid any punishment.</wrap>

of Law
**XP Value:** 200 **GP Value:** 400
Gods, Demigods, & Heroes
This is found as a quiver of 20 arrows. The arrows always hit and kill chaotic creatures at normal long bow ranges.

of Light
**XP Value:** 40 **GP Value:** 120
The Complete Book of Elves
These are among the most permanent and common of all the enspelled arrows. If a //continual light// spell is cast upon the shaft of an arrow, it can then be used to either spotlight or blind an enemy. These arrows are common among elf scouts, who carry them sheathed until there is a need for them.

of Lighting
**XP Value:** 50 **GP Value:** 100
DunGeons & DraGcons Rules Cyclopedia
The missile can create a //light// spell effect (30-foot-diameter), either upon command or when it hits a target. If a creature is hit, the victim must make a saving throw vs. spell or be //blinded// by the light (as if the spell had been cast at its eyes). The missile disintegrates when the //light// is created.

of Lightning
**XP Value:** 100 **GP Value:** 600
DRAGON Magazine 135
This arrow has a +2 bonus on attack rolls and causes 1d6 hp damage, plus 20 hp electrical damage. When the arrow hits, it emits a large and bright flash of light for a split second (long enough to light up a dungeon corridor). Anyone touching the victim suffers 1d10 hp electrical damage. The arrow is consumed in the lightning charge. If the arrow misses its intended target, it discharges all of its electrical energy upon hitting the ground (or any other solid object, such as a dungeon wall).

Lycanthrope Slayer
**XP Value:** 200 **GP Value:** 1,200
DRAGON Magazine 135
This silver-tipped arrow not only gives a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls, but also slays any lycanthrope it strikes, whether in beast or human form, unless the creature struck makes a saving throw vs. death magic. A successful saving throw causes the victim to take double damage from the arrow.

Maglubiyet’s Wounding
**XP Value:** 500 **GP Value:** 2,500
Dungeon Magazine 33
These arrows have been enchanted by Maglubiyet, a goblin deity. They can only be enspelled through diligent prayer and ceremony. They can be used only once and are +2 to attack and damage. A creature struck by an //arrow of Maglubiyet’s wounding// loses half its Strength immediately, in addition to the arrow damage. If the arrow remains in the wound, the creature does not regain its Strength or magical abilities, and cannot heal its wounds—even at normal rates. Goblins normally use this arrow against monsters that have no hands, so the arrow cannot be removed.

of Misdirection
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** 100
DraGon Magazine 135
This arrow is similar to an //arrow of direction//; the
difference is that this cursed arrow reveals the
wrong direction.

Missile Weapon of Accuracy
**XP Value:** 50 **GP Value:** 300
Oriental Adventures
This magical missile weapon is +3 on both attack and damage. Furthermore, all ranges are considered to be short range (no range modifier applied).

Missile Weapon of Distance*
**XP Value:** +50 **GP Value:** +300
Oriental Adventures
The weapon is able to fire to double all normal range categories for the weapon.

of Multiplicity
**XP Value:** 100 **GP Value:** 600
DRaGOn Magazine 135
For every 30 feet this arrow travels, another arrow appears in flight alongside the original arrow (up to a total of 10 arrows). Each arrow receives an individual attack roll with no bonus. For example, a fighter fires one of these arrows from a //bow +3//. The arrow travels a distance of 65 feet. Three arrows reach the target, each of them having normal attack chances (counting none from the magical bow).

Nilbog
**XP Value:** 100 **GP Value:** 150
POLYHEDRON Newszine 47
Nondescript in appearance, these arrows have an odd power. Due to their unusual enchantment, the target is cured of 1d6 hit points upon contact. As a final touch, the arrows create an illusion of damage upon the target (dents in armor, torn clothing, etc.). The illusion lasts one turn. //Nilbog arrows// are found in caches of 1d8.

Oberon’s Arrow of Subduing
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** —
Monster Mythology
Oberon carries arrows used for hunting stags that are enchanted to inflict subduing damage only.

Oberon’s Arrow of Slaying
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** —
Monster Mythology
Oberon carries a quiver of //arrows of slaying// and is known to use these on bugbears, goblins, hobgoblins, and orcs (others at the DM’s option). When they strike, the victim does not receive a saving throw.

Paralyzation
**XP Value:** 50 **GP Value:** 120
POLYHEDRON Newszine 47
These +1 arrows are found in caches of 1d6. In addition to the regular damage, a creature struck by an arrow must make a save vs. paralyzation or be paralyzed for 1d6 rounds.

of Penetrating
**XP Value:** 50 **GP Value:** 300
DUNGEONS & Dracons Rules Cyclopedia
A missile with this talent cannot be slowed by underbrush, webs (normal or magical), or other forms of cover. The victim’s Armor Class is not modified by cover of any sort.

of Penetration
**XP Value:** 50 **GP Value:** 300
DRAGON Magazine 135
This magical arrow has no attack or damage bonuses. Once fired from a bow, however, an //arrow of penetration// keeps going, phasing through any nonliving material in its path, until it reaches its maximum range or strikes a living object. Against this arrow, normal armor and shields are ignored in the determination of Armor Class. Magical armor and shields improve the Armor Class of the victim by one for each +1 of protection they provide, as do //rings// and //cloaks of protection//. //Bracers of defense//, however, are useless. Bonuses for cover and concealment are ignored unless the cover is made of living material. Creatures totally hidden from view are treated as invisible (-4 to hit them). Magical protections and Armor Class adjustments for high Dexterity still apply. The Armor Class of creatures with natural armor remains unaffected.

of Perseverance
**XP Value:** 50 **GP Value:** 300
DRAGON Magazine 135
Once shot, this arrow goes after its target regardless of range, as long as the target is within view. The arrow, however, gains a cumulative -1 to attack for every 100 yards beyond its maximum range that it travels. Once the arrow gains a total of a -10 penalty to attack, it vanishes. The arrow has a +2 bonus to damage.

of Piercing
**XP Value:** 50 **GP Value:** 300
DRAGON Magazine 135
The target of this missile must save vs. petrification or lose all protection provided by armor and hide. The subject has AC 10 with regards to this missile attack if the saving throw fails, the arrow then does maximum damage (6 hp, plus the Strength bonuses of the archer if applicable). The arrow does normal damage if the victim’s saving throw is successful.

of Polymorphing
**XP Value** **GP Value**
Glass: 225 1,350
Ice: 225 1,350
Monster: 225 1,350
Paper: 225 1,350
Small Animal: 225 1,350
Stone: 225 1,350
DraGoONn Magazine 135
An //arrow of polymorphing//is as rare as an //arrow of slaying//, and is thus infrequently encountered. This arrow is +3 to attack but not to damage. Besides taking normal damage after being hit, a creature struck by an //arrow of polymorphing// must save vs. //polymorph//. If successful, nothing further occurs. If the creature fails to save, it is polymorphed into another form. Only one arrow of this type may be found at a time.\\
<wrap indent>There are six different kinds of //arrows of polymorphing//; when found, a random roll is required to determine the arrow type. Note that the only creatures affected by //arrows of polymorphing// are those that are susceptible to the spell //polymorph other//. //Arrows of polymorphing// are classified according to the form into which they change the recipient. The six different arrow types are as follows:</wrap>

^ Roll ^ Form assumed |
| 1 | Stone |
| 2 | Monster |
| 3 | Ice |
| 4 | Small animal |
| 5 | Paper |
| 6 | Glass |

<wrap indent>**Stone:** A creature hit by an arrow of this type becomes petrified as if struck by a cockatrice. The duration of the petrification is permanent, although spells such as //stone to flesh// or //limited wish// may be used to reverse the effects of the arrow.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>**Monster:** This arrow //polymorphs// the victim into a randomly determined monster. If the victim’s personality is lost, the monster attacks all nearby creatures until it is killed or until there is nothing left for it to fight. The effects last until dispelled. The suggested monster types are as follows:</wrap>

^ Roll ^ Monster |
| 1 Werewolf |
| 2 | Medusa |
| 3 | Ogre |
| 4 | Troll |
| 5 | Owlbear |
| 6 | Five-headed hydra |

**Ice**: This is perhaps the most deadly of the various types of //arrows of polymorphing//. A creature hit by one of these arrows is instantly transformed into a statue of solid ice. Unless the statue is kept at a temperature below freezing, it melts away, completely destroying the //polymorphed// creature in the process. The ice statue lasts for as many rounds as the target creature has hit points. If the ice form is undone by a //dispel magic// spell (against 12th-level magic) or by other magical means, the victim is restored to life if a system shock roll is made; otherwise, the victim reappears, but is dead. For every round spent in the ice form, the victim loses | hp from the effects of melting—a fighter restored to life after 12 rounds in ice form has lost 12 hp.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>**Small animal:** An arrow of this sort transforms the creature it hits into a small, harmless animal such as a mouse (AC 8; MV 6; HD ¼; hp 1; #AT nil). This form lasts until //dispelled//.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>**Paper:** This type of arrow reduces any individual it hits to a two-dimensional paper replica of he, she, or it. This “paper doll” is life-size and is highly flammable. The duration of this effect is only 4d6 turns. After this time has expired and if the paper has not been destroyed, the individual returns to normal. These paper dolls may be folded and carried without injury to the //polymorphed// individual (unless the effect expires, which causes the individual to return to his normal size and shape).</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>**Glass:** This final arrow type turns a creature it hits to solid glass. The effects of this arrow are permanent and may only be reversed with a //stone to flesh// or similar spell. A //glassteel// spell can preserve the victim from most harm until further aid can be rendered, but the spell must be removed before the victim is fully restored by other means.</wrap>

of Pursuit
**XP Value:** 85 **GP Value:** 500
DRAGON Magazine 135
An //arrow of pursuit// is +3 to hit and damage. When shot from a bow, the arrow unerringly seeks out the living being with the greatest number of hit points within its range, then heads for that individual—no matter what the original target. In addition, if the arrow misses on its first pass, it returns on the following round, after a long curved, flight and attempts to hit the target a second time, now with a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls. If the second pass misses, it tries one last time on the following round with a +1 bonus. If it fails then, it crashes into the earth and is destroyed. This arrow has a range of 3 miles, though it does not often need to follow its target that far.\\
<wrap indent>An //arrow of pursuit// is very useful when a character wants to pick off a group leader who is moving about in an army, protected by troops. In this case, the arrow winds its way in and out of the troops until it hits its target. Only one such arrow may be found at a time.</wrap>

Quarrel of Biting
**XP Value** **GP Value**
Acid: 150 400
Normal: 100 300
Poison: 150 400
The Ruins of Undermountain
This rare type of magical crossbow bolt does 1d6 damage when striking, turning into a small winged snake upon impact. The snake immediately hits and bites for an additional 1d4+1 points of damage. It then flies about for another two rounds, biting at the same target, before dissipating into a plume of harmless smoke. Quarrel snakes can damage creatures vulnerable to +1 weapons. Such snakes are unintelligent and uncontrollable by magical means. Their combat statistics are: AC 3; MV FI 12 (B); HD 1+1; 9 hp; THACO 19, #AT 1. //Quarrels of biting// are more common in eastern and southern lands of the Realms, but the costs listed above apply to their creation and sale prices in the North. Rumors persist across Faerun of poisonous and even acid-spitting specimens of these weapons. Poisonous or not, most guilds, factions, and priesthoods do not consider the use of these weapons a good act (or, in the case of the priests and worshipers of Tempus, an “honorable” act). //Quarrels of biting// are usually found in bundles of 1d12.

Kingdom of Nithia
Red shafted arrows are not uncommon in Nithia. Some are made from red-colored reeds while others are dyed. The common belief is that a red arrow seeks blood, making it more likely to hit and cause damage. This belief is backed by the fact that truly magical //red arrows// do exist in Nithia. Their source is uncertain. Perhaps a nomadic archer, a sect of priests, or an elderly scribe created them. In any event, a true (magical) //red arrow// provides an equal bonus to attack and damage rolls. Bonuses are as follows:

^ Roll ^ Bonus |
| 1 | +1 |
| 2 | +2 |
| 3 | +3 |
| 4 | +4 |
| 5 | +5 |
| 6 | cursed, -1 |

of Refilling
**XP Value:** 100 **GP Value:** 400
DunNGEoNS & DRAGONS Rules Cyclopedia
This talent gives no special effects to a missile when fired. If left in a container with other missiles of the same type (that is, a //refilling arrow// with normal arrows or a //refilling sling stone// with normal sling stones), however, it magically creates 1d20 more missiles of the normal ‘type each day.

of Returning
**XP Value:** 40 **GP Value:** 240
DRAGON Magazine 135
Once fired, this arrow returns to the archer’s quiver after an unsuccessful attempt to strike its target has been made. An //arrow of returning// is +1 to attack and damage rolls. It returns at the end of the round in which it was fired. For example, a ranger fires an //arrow of returning// at a dragon. Its attack roll is not high enough to damage the dragon, so the arrow returns to the ranger’s quiver, where it can be used again on the ranger’s very next shot.

of Rock Piercing
**XP Value:** 50 **GP Value:** 300
DRAGON Magazine 135
This arrow is made of a special, magical metal. When used by an archer of at least 16 Strength, this missile automatically hits its intended target—which is a specific point of nonliving rock into which the arrow sinks, leaving around 6 inches of the rear of its shaft exposed. A small steel ring is set into the rear of the arrow, to which can be tied a thin line or cord. If an archer with an //arrow of piercing// encounters a deep chasm with no way across, he or she needs only to tie a rope to the end of the arrow and shoot the arrow at the intended target. The arrow automatically hits its target dead center, and the archer can now cross the chasm. If a character of less than 16 Strength attempts to fire the arrow, it bounces off the rocky surface at which it was fired.\\
<wrap indent>The //arrow of piercing// is reusable; in order to retrieve the arrow, the archer simply grasps it with both hands and pulls it from the target. The arrow then slides out if an open doors roll is successful. If the roll fails, another attempt may be made one turn later.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>This arrow actually bounces off any fleshy creature at which it is fired (doing no damage), but it acts as an //arrow +5// against any living or animated target composed of stone (stone golem, crystal warrior—others). Additionally, it slays instantly any creature that has been petrified (treat stone as AC 0), if a saving throw vs. death magic is failed; a successful save means only double damage.</wrap>

of Roping
**XP Value:** 20 **GP Value:** 120
DRAGON Magazine 135
When used, this magical arrow leaves behind a smoky brown trail through the entire arc of its flight. The trail solidifies into a material brown rope when the arrow strikes its target, bonding to the bow that fired it. The arrow bonds to any type of wood it hits, and has a 70% chance of penetrating and bonding to stone or metal. Once bonded, the arrow never pulls free (unless excessive weight is applied), and only bends if a successful bend bars roll is made. The rope can support up to 500 pounds of weight at once before it breaks or the arrow pulls free (50% chance of either).

of Scent Detection
**XP Value:** 20 **GP Value:** 120
DraGon Magazine 135
This arrow allows its user to smell odors from the location at which the arrow landed, similar to the //arrows of clairaudience// and //clairvoyance//. This ability is activated by uttering the command word (“Scent!”), and shooting the arrow. The archer can then smell odors around the arrow’s location by plugging his nose and inhaling. In so doing, the archer is able to breath normally, inhaling air from the arrow’s location. One major drawback of the arrow’s use is that poisonous or harmful gases may be inhaled in this manner, affecting the archer as if he or she were breathing the gases normally. If the arrow is entirely buried in water or mud, the arrow’s user coughs and chokes for one round, being unable for that time to breath, fight, or even move. This effect wears off immediately afterward, leaving the archer no worse for the experience. Odors within 30 feet of the arrow may be inhaled and sensed. Few archers use this arrow, but some rangers and scouts have detected monsters with especially strong scents.

of Screaming
**XP Value:** 20 **GP Value:** 120
DuNGEONS & DRAGONS Rules Cyclopedia
This arrow’s effect occurs when the missile is fired, even if it misses the target. As it travels through the air, the missile produces a loud cry, causing all within 30 feet of its path to check morale. If the morale check fails, the victims retreat in fear for 1d8 rounds.

of Screaming II
**XP Value:** 20 **GP Value:** 120
DRAGON Magazine 135
When this missile is fired, it emits an ear-shat-tering scream that deafens all beings within 30 feet of its flight path for 1d4+2 rounds—includ-ing the archer, unless protected. In addition, those affected drop everything and cover their ears during the melee round in which the arrow is in flight. Any spellcasters lose their concentration, so all spells to be cast during this time are lost. There is a 15% chance that a set of ear plugs are found with these arrows, to protect the archer.

of Seeking
**XP Value:** 100 **GP Value:** 500
Dunceons & Dracons Rules Cyclopedia
This talent only functions when the missile is fired at an object; it is not usable against creatures. It automatically hits any one target object within range as long as the path of travel is clear. It may be used as a //missile of disarming//, if desired, or it can be used to sever a normal rope, pierce a sack, push a button, trigger a trap, etc. It automatically misses any creature at which it is aimed.

of Seeking II
**XP Value:** 100 **GP Value:** 500
The Complete Book of Elves
This is a more powerful version of an arrow imbued with a //seeking// spell. Not only does it round corners in pursuit of its prey, it also gains a bonus of +2 damage. These arrows are usually found in groups of 1d10, although sometimes as many as 2d8 can be found.

of Set
**XP Value:** 250 **GP Value:** 1,500
DRAGON Magazine 135
At first glance, this appears to be an ordinary arrow. Closer examination reveals the arrowhead to be made of bone and carved to resemble the head of a serpent. An //arrow of Set// is +1 to attack and damage. Anyone hit by one of these arrows must save vs. poison at -1 or die within 1d4 rounds. A character whose saving throw is successful takes 2d6 hit points damage from the venom in addition to the damage taken when hit. The arrow disintegrates on impact.\\
<wrap indent>Making an //arrow of Set// requires bone from a poisonous snake (for the arrowhead) plus the snake’s venom (the arrowhead is steeped in it). A priest must cast //poison// on the arrowhead during the enchantment. Only one is found at a time.</wrap>

of Signaling
**XP Value:** 20 **GP Value:** 120
DRAGON Magazine 135
This magical arrow has a brightly colored shaft, usually red, orange, or yellow in color, It sports a crystalline point. If used as a weapon, it does normal damage. However, if fired directly into the air, at least 100 yards over the head of the bowman, it leaves a trail of glittering sparks behind it from the 100-yard height up to a height of 500 yards, regardless of the type of bow from which it was fired. When the arrow is 500 yards above the archer, the arrowhead explodes in a sphere of light 100 yards across—of the same color as the arrow’s shaft. The ball of light is visible for many miles and lasts for 2d4 melee rounds before fading. The arrow disintegrates upon bursting.

of Silence
**XP Value:** 20 **GP Value:** 120
Dracon Magazine 135
This magical arrow is very useful indeed—especially when PCs are seeking entry to some heavily guarded fortification. Not only does this arrow hide the “twang” of bow shots, it also silences any noise made by its target. Furthermore, any actions conducted within a 15-foot radius of the arrow are cloaked as if by a permanent version of the priestal spell, //silence 15' radius//.

of Sinking
**XP Value:** 200 **GP Value:** 400
DunGEONS & Dracons Rules Cyclopedia
When fired at a water craft, an //arrow of sinking// inflicts 1d10+10 (11-20) points of hull damage when it hits. (The AC of the vessel is used, as if the shot were a ramming or catapult attack.)

of Slaying
**XP Value:** 250 **GP Value:** 2,500
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Rules Cyclopedia
If the die rolls for a missile indicate this ability, roll 1d100. The result indicates the missile’s opponent. When an opponent is hit by this missile, the victim must make a saving throw vs. death magic or die.

of Slaying II
**XP Value:** 250 **GP Value:** 2,500
DRAGON Magazine 35
Ineffective against “wild and crazy” comedians, even when struck in the head. In game terms, this arrow is -2 to attacks against bards.

of Slaying III
**XP Value:** 250 **GP Value:** 2,500
DUNGEON MASTER Guide
This is an //arrow +3// with unusual physical characteristics—a shaft of some special material, feathers of some rare creature, a head of some strange design, a rune carved on the nock, etc. These characteristics indicate the arrow is effective against some creature type. If the arrow is employed against the kind of creature it has been enchanted to slay, the missile kills it instantly, if it hits the target creature. The following list comprises only a portion of the possible kinds of these arrows:

^ Roll ^ Creature ^ Roll ^ Creature |

of Sleighing
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** 50
DRAGON Magazine 35
When this powerful item is drawn in a bow, in a combat situation, it immediately expands and unfolds into a full-size, four-place toboggan.

Snake
**XP Value:** 50 **GP Value:** 100
POLYHEDRON Newszine 47
When loosed, these //arrows +1// transform themselves into pit vipers (AC 8; HD %; hp 3; #AT 1; Dmg 14; SA poison). Their poison is weak, so all saving throws are at +1. They remain in snake form until killed (which also destroys the arrows). A //dispel magic// spell causes them to turn into nonmagical arrows.

of Speaking
**XP Value:** 50 **GP Value:** 150
DuNGEONS & DraGons Rules Cyclopedia
A missile with this talent misses any creature at which it is fired—it is used for communication purposes only. The user may give the missile any message of 20 words or less and then shoot it, either naming a place within 10 miles or aiming at a target. The missile automatically lands on the floor or ground in the target area, repeats its message aloud twice, and falls silent.

Stun Bolt
**XP Value:** 200 **GP Value:** 700
Dwarves Deep
This special crossbow quarrel can be fired from any size crossbow from hand to heavy, and looks like a stone door knob on a short, thin shaft. When fired, a //stun bolt// behaves in all cases (range, ROF, etc.) as if fired from hand crossbow. However, on impact it shatters into dust-sized motes, releasing a stunning magical shock of force that does 2d4 damage to any being struck. Victims of a //stun bolt// strike are unable to think or act coherently for the round following the hit (no saving throw). Only living things are affected—undead and objects suffer no shock effects. Such weapons are often used by dwarven guards.

of Stunning
**XP Value:** 250 **GP Value:** 750
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Rules Cyclopedia
A victim hit by a missile with this talent must make a saving throw vs. spell or be stunned for 1d6 rounds.

Stirge’s Bite
**XP Value:** 130 **GP Value:** 780
DRAGON Magazine 135
This //arrow +5// has a steel shaft and is rather large in size. When the arrow hits, it drains one ounce of its target’s blood, which is then stored in a hollow compartment in the shaft. The following round, the arrow detaches itself from its victim and may be recovered later by the archer. Due to the importance of blood as an ingredient in the fabrication of scroll inks and potions, this arrow is highly prized by wizards, priests, and alchemists.

of Teleporting
**XP Value:** 400 **GP Value:** 800
DuNGEONS & DRAGONS Rules Cyclopedia
A victim hit by a missile with this talent must make a saving throw vs. spell (at a +2 bonus to the roll) or be teleported to a point 1d100 miles away, with direction and distance determined randomly. The victim cannot arrive in the air or within a solid object.

of Transporting
**XP Value:** 400 **GP Value:** 800
DunGEONS & DRAGONS Rules Cyclopedia
A victim hit by this missile must make a saving throw vs. spell or be sent to a point up to 360 feet away, as determined by the missile user. This is identical to the wizard spell dimension door, and cannot cause the victim to appear within a solid object.

Wooden
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 5,000
The Complete Book of Elves
This is a completely organic arrow. Made entirely from wood and carved with ornate runes, it appears to be nothing more than a novelty, or perhaps a woodcarver’s doodle. In reality, this arrow is a very dangerous weapon, and it radiates strong enchantment magic.\\
<wrap indent>The arrow ignores all nonorganic armor. Thus, metal armor offers no protection against this missile, while leather, hide, and scale mail made from a creature’s skin offer normal bonuses. Studded leather protects only as leather armor.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Those wearing metal armor are considered to be AC 10 against this arrow. Magical protection still applies; thus, plate mail +4, although normally AC -1, would instead be AC 6 against the wooden arrow.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>These arrows are never found in bunches. If encountered, there is but a single shaft. Furthermore, the //wooden arrow// is an exception to elven arrows in that it is always destroyed when fired, regardless of whether or not it hits anything. The wood necessary to the enchantment is such that it can function no other way.</wrap>

of Wounding
**XP Value:** 500 **GP Value:** 2,500
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Rules Cyclopedia
When a missile with the //wounding// talent strikes a target creature, it inflicts normal damage. In addition, however, it causes the loss of | hit point per round thereafter until a magical cure is applied (a potion, cure spell of any type, etc.). However, no undead creature or construct (golem, living statue, etc.) can be //wounded// with this talent, and such creatures suffer only the initial damage.

===== Arrowhead of Marking =====
**XP Value:** 25 **GP Value:** 50
The Ruins of Undermountain
These normal-looking stone arrowheads must be shaped by the being enchanting them. The common use of these devices is as dungeon and maze markers. If one is placed on a stone surface, and a command word (set during the enchantment of the item) spoken, the arrowhead sinks into the surface of the stone. There it fuses, leaving a clearly visible arrowhead mark, pointing in the direction it was set.\\
<wrap indent>These items may be used to point directions, or multiples can be placed to form code symbols or messages in the stone walls, floors, and ceilings of buildings, cave networks, or dungeons. Harpers often place them on stones in outdoor areas, to mark trails or burial sites. Typical treasure hoards contain 2d12 of these arrowheads.</wrap>

===== Art =====

Few magical pieces of artwork (paintings and portraits in particular) exist in the AD&D campaign worlds, but those that do show an amazing diversity of properties. Some can be used by nonmages simply through proper concentration; others can be used to their fullest extent only by wizards. Most radiate a magical aura. Unless otherwise specified, magical paintings are totally immune to normal fire and to normal crushing blows, or the effects of time. They gain a +4 saving throw bonus vs. other hazards (magical fire, electricity, and so on), reflecting the strength of their dweomers.

Blue on Bronze
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 7,500
DRAGON Magic
This painting is an abstract swirl of deep blues and violets. If anyone studies the painting for 2d10 minutes, a voice sounds in his or her head asking for a question. If the character rolls a successful Wisdom Check, the magical painting correctly answers any yes or no question. The painting answers one question per being per day.

Dragonnel-by-the-Cliff
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** 9,000
DRAGON Magazine 179
This is an unframed square painting, 3 feet to a side, and mounted on tightly stretched dragonnel hide. Its powers are mostly unknown, and this fact alone makes the painting worth 5,000 gp. Unlike the other paintings described in this section, //Dragonnel// radiates no aura of magic. Only an //identify// spell can show that it is magical. This work was created two centuries ago by the half-drow wizard Liemuai (now rumored to have become the lich lord of an Underdark kingdom) and is thought to reside in the treasure repository of some drow noble. This painting originated from an undisclosed location in the Pomarj region of Grayhawk. It depicts a large dragonnel perched on a rocky cliff above a river valley.\\
<wrap indent>By concentrating and speaking the word of summoning, “fuga,” the viewer can call forth the dragonnel, causing it to vanish from the painting and appear before the summoner. The dragonnel is totally obedient to the mental orders of the person who called it forth, willing to act as a mount to the limits of its strength or to fight to the death. Note that obedience is not transferrable, since the mental rapport necessary for control exists only between the dragonnel and its summoner.</wrap>\\

**Dragonnel:** (INT semi-; AL NE; AC 3; MV 12, Fl 18 (C, D if mounted); HD 8 +4; hp 68; THACO 11; #AT 3; Dmg 1d6/1d6/4d4; SA tail slap to the rear, with no other attack, for 2d6; ML 13.

<wrap indent>If called during the day, the dragonnel remains in existence until the sun touches the horizon, disappearing instantly—with no warning (potentially embarrassing to its rider if in flight at the time). If called during the night, it disappears at the moment the sun first appears above the horizon. The dragonnel can be //dispelled// by its summoner at any time, returning it to the painting. If the beast is killed, the corpse remains until the sun next touches the horizon, then returns to the painting. The dragonnel can only be summoned once in any 24-hour period; even if it is slain, another dragonnel can not be called again for 24 hours.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Alternatively, by concentrating on the painting for one round and speaking the word of changing, “mutare,” the viewer can //shape change// (like the wizard spell) into a dragonnel. The duration of the effect is 20 turns, but it can be //dispelled// by the viewer at any time before it expires. This power can be used three times a day.</wrap>

The Gladiators
**XP Value:** **GP Value:** 48,000
DRAGON Magazine 179
//The Gladiators// is a large painting, 6 feet square, heavy and cumbersome. As its name implies, the painting depicts four heavily armed and armored gladiators facing each other in a sandy arena. It was painted by Arlena the Pair, to //ward// her country villa. Arlena herself vanished two decades ago and is believed to be dead. The painting disappeared around the same time, but rumors have since reported it in various locales. Because of the size of the painting, transporting and hiding it have undoubtedly proved to be serious problems.\\
<wrap indent>If a human, demihuman or humanoid (except Arlena herself) walks within 10 feet of the painting without first saying a special password (this word is thought to be lost with Arlena), the victim and all clothing and equipment are immediately transported into the painting. This effect is similar to that of a //mirror of life trapping//, except that it does not require the victim to look at the painting. Once within the painting, the victim is immediately attacked by the four chain mail-clad gladiators.</wrap>

**Gladiators (4):** (INT average; AL N; AC 4; MV 12; F6; hp 48 each; THACO 15; #AT 2; Dmg by weapon type; splint mail, two-handed sword).

The gladiators are totally resistant to all enchantment/charm, fear, and other mind-affecting spells; to other spells, they have a 60% magic resistance. They are totally single-minded in their intent to kill the victim and cannot be reasoned with in any way.

<wrap indent>If the victim is slain, the body is immediately //transported// back outside the painting. If the gladiators are slain, the victim cannot escape from the painting unless someone outside speaks the word of release, “libertas,” which may be learned by casting a //legend lore// spell). Any damage received from the gladiators is real and can be cured normally. None of the gladiators’ weaponry or armor may be brought out of the painting.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Up to eight creatures may be trapped by the painting at any one time. They are kept totally separate from each other, each with four gladiators to fight. When the word of release is spoken, the creature who has been trapped the longest is the first to be released (first in, first out). For each subsequent repetition of the word, another creature is released until all have been freed. If the painting is “full” and a ninth creature passes by, the ninth victim is trapped and the creature who has been within the painting the longest is freed, When a creature is trapped by the painting, his or her image—seemingly part of the painting—appears in the arena, but remains visible for only one round. After that time, the painting returns to normal.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>If someone outside the painting speaks the word of summoning, “aggredivi” (also lost with Arlena but recoverable with //legend lore//), the four gladiators vanish from the painting and appear standing before it. (Note that this has no effect on anyone within the painting; they still have their own four gladiators to deal with.) The gladiators immediately attack anyone designated by the person who spoke the word, and fight until either they or their opponents are dead. This is all they can do; if there is no one to fight, or if their summoner tries to give them other instructions, they immediately return to the painting. Once the combat is over, one way or the other, the gladiators or their corpses (and all equipment) vanish and the painting returns to normal. The gladiators can be summoned once per day. The word of summoning must be spoken within 50 feet of the painting.</wrap>

Glorindel’s Gates
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** 10,000
DRAGON Magazine 179
During her sojourn across the lands of the Forgotten Realms, but before her return to the city of Waterdeep (and eventual disappearance), the wizard-bard Glorindel put much effort into creating a number of small, exquisitely crafted paintings depicting places she had visited on her extensive travels. As suited her peaceful nature at this time, they were typically uninhabited areas of great scenic beauty—sylvan glades, wilderness lakes, and forbidden plateaus. Some paintings, however, depicted some less scenic areas that were of importance to her, such as the Market in Waterdeep and the courtyard of her villa. These small paintings, her //gates//, were Glorindel’s favored means of transport.\\
<wrap indent>Any human, demihuman, or humanoid with Intelligence not less than 13 and Wisdom not less than 12 may harness the power of one of these paintings. If the painting is stared at, uninterrupted, for two rounds, the viewer experiences the sensation of the image in the painting enlarging until it fills his or her entire field of vision, becoming ever more real as it enlarges. After a further round, the viewer is able to “step into” the painting. The effect is identical to the spell //teleport without error//, To someone standing nearby, the viewer seems to simply vanish, along with all items carried. The painting does not //teleport// with the user (although if the viewer has another of //Glorindels gate// paintings in his or her backpack, the second does //teleport//).</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Although Glorindel’s home in Waterdeep was destroyed by undead foes, her body was never found. Some believe that she used one of her gates to effect her escape when it became apparent that all was lost. Whatever the case, Glorindel has not been seen since. No one knows how many of //Glorindel’s gates// were created or may still exist. Only three are known for certain to have survived, all owned by the bard Diarmund of Waterdeep. All of //Glorindel’s gates// are small paintings, usually less than 1-foot square. Unlike most other magical paintings, they have no innate resistance to harm; they can be damaged and destroyed like any normal painting.</wrap>

Glorindel’s Living Painting
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** 36,000
DRAGON Magazine 179
Further triumphs of Glorindel’s art were her “living paintings.” These are generally square, and up to 6 feet per side, usually depicting scenic panoramas. The magic involved in these works is more apparent than that of the gates as the scenes in these paintings actually move. In a seascape, the clouds may race, sea gulls fly, and waves wash over the rocky shore. In a forest scene, the sun may cast shifting beams of light through the gently moving branches. These paintings are, without exception, strikingly beautiful, and could—if it weren’t for their frames—almost be mistaken for windows.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Although their major purpose is to please the eye, each of these paintings has additional powers. When triggered by a command word “fascinum,” each has the effect of the spell, //hypnotic pattern//, This effect lasts until dispelled by another command word “en.” In addition, the following spells may be cast upon creatures captivated by the painting, each spell triggered by its own word of command: //blindness//, “‘caecitas;” //suggestion//, obsequium;” //geas//, “exite;” and //sleep//, “somnus.” These spells have no effect on anyone not previously captivated by the //hypnotic pattern// effect, and the spells do not count as being cast from the viewer’s mind. Each is usable once per day.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>As with //Glorindel's gates//, no one is sure precisely how many living paintings Glorindel created or how many have survived. Due to their great value (15,000 gp is a bare minimum), those that still exist may probably be found in the collections of rich merchants, nobles, and other persons of wealth.</wrap>

<wrap indent>Each of these paintings depicts one person—a close friend, a trusted counsellor, close advisor, or family member—with whom Lord Balto would often have cause to consult. The purpose of these paintings was to make such consultation easy. Simply concentrating on the painting sets up a strong mental rapport between the viewer and the person depicted. The rapport takes one complete round to develop; after that time, it allows the two people to communicate fully as though through //telepathy//. There is no limit to the duration of the rapport or to the number of times it can be established. All that is required is for the viewer to look at the painting and concentrate on establishing the rapport. During rapport, both participants can engage in no other activity.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>As the rapport is being established, the person depicted becomes aware of a chilling cold and a sensation of presence. If the person is willing to enter communication, rapport is established after one round; if unwilling, a save vs. spell must be made to terminate contact. A successful save means that contact is broken and cannot be reattempted for a period of one hour. If the save fails, the person being contacted has one last chance to resist rapport. During the round that establishes rapport, contact may be resisted by the use of mind-shielding spells, devices, or psionics. Once established, rapport can only be broken by the viewer or through the death or loss of consciousness of one of the participants—there is no range limit.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>All of Igraine’s portrait paintings still in existence, except for one to be discussed later, depict people who have died since the creation of the paintings. If anyone, through ignorance or design, tries to establish rapport through such a painting, there is a fixed 50% chance of establishing rapport with the spirit of the dead person. Treat the rapport as the spell //contact other plane//. To determine the chances of insanity, knowledge, and veracity, assume the spirit is nine planes removed from the viewer of the painting. The viewer can ask one question for each two levels of experience (only wizards receive benefit for Intelligence scores over 15). Since rapport with a dead person requires much more of the painting’s power, this can only be attempted once per day.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Rumors tell of one surviving painting that does not depict a dead confidant of Lord Balto. This is the painting that Igraine was working on at the time of her death. The background is complete, as is the body of the person depicted—only the face is missing. Perhaps because its dweomer was not finally bound by the completion of the painting, this famed “unfinished portrait” has an additional power over and above those possessed by Igraine’s other works. By concentrating strongly on the painting for a period of two rounds, the viewer can make the likeness of anyone well known by the viewer to appear in the portrait. The painting can then be used to establish rapport with that person (in this case, a saving throw is automatic whether the person being contacted is willing or not). If rapport fails or is broken, the face vanishes from the portrait again. This power can be used once every two full days. Although no firm information is available, there is a persistent rumor that Igraine’s unfinished portrait hangs in the halls of a dwarf king.</wrap>

Norval’s Timely Portrait
**XP Value:** 750 **GP Value:** 4,000
POLYHEDRON Newszine 8
This small, canvas, inset in a wooden frame, fits into the palm of one’s hand. To use it, a command word is spoken and the canvas is held up to a living subject for 10 minutes. At the end of that time, an image of the subject appears on the canvas. During the life of the subject, the painted figure mimics the portrayed individual, showing age and well being. At the point when the subject passes from this world (even if just leaving the plane), the canvas is wiped clean and is ready to be used again.

Pigments of Longevity
**XP Value:** 5,000 **GP Value:** 50,000
DUNGEON Magazine 10
This powerful but perilous magical item extends the life-span of the person whose features are portrayed on its canvas. The canvas must be subjected to //enchant an item//, //polymorph object//, //trap the soul//, and //wish// spells as a diamond of at least 50,000 gp value is crushed and sprinkled on its surface. The portrait must be painted by a living, master painter, using //pigments of longevity//, As the last brush stroke is applied, the portrait must be dried using another //wish//. Then 1d100 is rolled against the following table.

^ Roll ^ Effect |
| 01-20 | Subject’s body shrivels, and his or her essence is trapped for eternity in the portrait. |
| 21-35 | No effect; subject ages normally. Portrait may not be retouched. |
| 36-60 | Subject’s life-span is doubled |
| 61-80 | Subject’s life-span is tripled |
| 81-95 | Subject’s life-span is quadrupled |
| 96-99 | Subject’s life-span is quintupled |
| 00 | Subject’s aging capacity ceases. Immortality is achieved! |

<wrap indent>Only one //portrait of longevity// may be made of a person during his or her lifetime, but a portrait may be periodically retouched with //pigments of longevity//. Each time a portrait is retouched, the table above must be consulted to determine the potency of the restoration. Thus, a subject may be trapped forever or gain immortality the second time around, and must decide if the gamble is worthwhile. Even //wish// spells cannot alter a roll on this table.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The formula for a //portrait of longevity// is inherently evil. There is a 1% cumulative chance per decade that an alignment shift toward chaotic evil (lawful to neutral to chaotic; good to neutral to evil; one axis at a time) affects the figure depicted by a //portrait of longevity//.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>If the portrait is destroyed, the following table should be consulted:</wrap>\\

^ Roll ^ Effect |
| 01-20 | Subject turns to dust, forever dead. |
| 21-65 | Subject reverts to true age. If that age is greater than venerable, the subject dies. |
| 66-99 | The subject ages normally from the current, apparent age. |
| 00 | Subject’s aging capacity is destroyed with the portrait—Immortality is achieved! |

<wrap indent>//Portraits of longevity// are extremely rare. The only known location of the formula for creating them is the //Astral Tome of Ildranadum//, an artifact last known to exist in the astral stronghold of the Archmage Azurax.</wrap>

A canvas is stretched on an ordinary artist’s frame; when a magical word is spoken, the canvas takes on the image of whatever faces it. The result is a very realistic painting.

The Watchers
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** 12,000
DRAGON Magazine 179
Created over three centuries ago by Tal Alanan, an evil elven wizard, //The Watchers// is a bulky painting, 4 feet wide by 3 feet high, on heavy canvas. When last reported, it was framed in dark oak. The work depicts a wooded area with heavy undergrowth. Barely discernible are the eyes of several creatures watching through the bush (a viewer must consciously examine the picture to notice them). The dark-colored style has an oppressive, almost menacing, feel to it. Just passing the picture or seeing it in peripheral vision gives the viewer an overpowering impression of subtle movement; leaves seem to shift, and the bush seems to stir as creatures move behind cover. Looking directly at the //painting// removes this discomforting effect.\\
<wrap indent>Concentrated scrutiny for more than one round activates the powers of the painting. The viewer becomes disoriented, then feels that he or she is being drawn into the painting. If a saving throw vs. spell fails, the viewer’s mind merges with the consciousness of a small, woodland animal, such as a fox or an owl, one actually existing in the wooded area nearest to the painting (and viewer) at the moment, within a range of 20 miles. If no such woodland area exists or if the viewer's saving throw is successful, no ill effects are suffered. If mental merging with an animal does occur, the viewer's sensory perspective moves as the animal does, and all senses become heightened and attuned to the forest and the creature.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Unless the viewer is aware of the problem and concentrates on avoiding it during the moment of disorientation, the victim’s mentality becomes one with the small animal as well, unable to withdraw. (Recognizing this problem requires a Wis- dom check on 1d20 each time the painting is gazed at until the viewer makes the check. The check need not be made again.) Once this magical union is joined, it can be broken only by blocking the victim’s view of the painting or an anti-magical field (not by //dispel magic//). During this union, the participant’s body becomes rigid and unresponsive, while heart and breathing rates rise drastically, posing severe danger. For every 10 rounds the victim remains magically captured by the painting, a successful system shock roll must be made or take 3d6 hit points damage from physical exhaustion.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>When an unwitting mental union is broken, the victim’s heart rate and breathing drop back to normal, but the animal mentality remains. For each round such a union exists, the animal mentality remains for one round after union is broken. Role-playing this event is left to the DM and player involved. After this period, the victim’s mind returns to normal. This does not occur if the viewer passes the Wisdom check.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>If the viewer makes the Wisdom check and then voids the subsequent saving throw, he or she is in control of the merged animal when the union occurs, able to move anywhere at will, within the nearby woodland, with movement and speed appropriate to the animal (see the //Monstrous MANUAL™// accessory under **Mammal, Small**, or the appropriate animal type; only normal, non-magical animals are contacted). In such a case, the viewer can break contact at will, returning to his or her own body immediately. However, the stress on the heart, requiring a system shock roll, still exists.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>In addition to controlling the animal, someone who knows the powers of the painting can even choose where the animal to be controlled is located. Before viewing the painting, the user must concentrate on the desired region. The only restriction is that the area must be wooded and within 50 miles. As with //teleportation//, the chance of successfully “reaching” the target area depends on familiarity; use the same probabilities for success as for the spell //teleport//, in the //PHB//. If the viewer fails the roll (comes in “low” or “high”) or does not concentrate on a specific locale, the wooded area used is the one nearest to the painting within a 20-mile radius.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>If, during the union, the animal is wounded, the viewer immediately loses a proportion of hit points equal to the proportion lost by the animal (if a 4-hit point fox takes a wound doing 3 points damage, the viewer immediately takes damage equal to % total hit points, not the character’s current hit point value), fractions are rounded down; save vs. death magic for half of this damage. If the animal is killed, the viewer must save vs. death magic or die instantly. (Even if the saving throw is successful, hit points drop to one, and the victim falls unconscious for 4d4 rounds.)</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Any spellcaster who successfully avoids merging with an animal mind, then concentrates on the painting for 10 uninterrupted rounds, gains the power to cast one of the following spells, chosen at will: //entangle//, //call woodland beings//, //speak with animals//, //animal friendship//, //invisibility to animals//, //transport via plants//. This spell is in addition to the character’s spell allotment for the day. In the case of nondruid spellcasters, the level of casting is 6th level; for druids, the level of casting is the druid’s own level plus two, or 6th level, whichever is greater. Each spell gained can be used only once and must be cast within a 24-hour period of viewing the painting, or else the acquired spell fades from the caster’s mind.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>It is said that Tal Alanan kept close, covert watch over his elven subjects using this painting, and he was greatly feared for his intimate knowledge of the occurrences within his minor kingdom. Until he was overthrown by a neighboring woodland kingdom, he successfully crushed every rebellion raised against him and controlled all aspects of life within his magical reach. After his death, his possessions (including the painting) were collected, but later stolen by rival wizards. The painting’s whereabouts are currently unknown.</wrap>

Widow’s Walk
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** 40,000
DraGon Magazine 179
This painting shows the crowded dockside of a bustling port. Created by Balfas the Seafarer, famed for his love of ships and all things nautical, the painting was reportedly destroyed in the sack of his island manor, but reappeared in the collection of Ramoth, of Northport. This is often cited as evidence that Ramoth in fact funded the raid on the manor—in any case, there is serious doubt that Ramoth can tap, or is even aware of, the true powers of his prize.\\
<wrap indent>When someone viewing the painting looks closely at the crowd on the dockside, he or she immediately notices a representation of the person most on the viewer’s mind during that day. While initially startling and intriguing, this is but a minor effect of the painting, an intimate alignment with the viewer’s mind.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The major power of the painting is to allow the viewer total protection from divination, detection, and scrying spells or powers. The viewer cannot be detected from afar by any means while concentrating on viewing the painting for 10 rounds. Psionics, scrying spells, devices such as //crystal balls// and //magical mirrors//—all are useless. If the viewer is a wizard of 6th level or above, this effect protects the character from detection by any creature up to the status of a demigod. The isolation effect lasts for up to eight hours or until the invoker consciously dispels it. During this time, he or she need not concentrate on maintaining the effect; nor is it necessary to continue viewing the painting. The effect can be invoked only once per day and can be granted to but one person at a time. This power does not confer any form of //invisibility//; the protection is restricted to magical and psionic forms of detection alone. Any creature that can see the viewer directly can attack without interference from the picture.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>In addition to the isolation effect, the viewer of the painting can cast each of the following wizard spells once per day, at the 18th level, by staring at the painting for one uninterrupted hour: //control weather//, //part water//, //water breathing//, and //fog cloud//. These spells may be maintained indefinitely in the viewer’s mind if uncast.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The painting is relatively small, 2- by 2-foot square, and is lightly framed. Despite its fragile appearance, it is totally immune to damage from water or lightning. All other damage is saved against at +2.</wrap>

===== Astrolabe =====

The historical astrolabe was a device used to determine the astron of the sun, the moon, and other celestial objects. Originally, the navigator of a sea-going vessel would locate a relatively stationary stellar object (the North Star, for instance) and find its position. From that reading, the navigator would be able to calculate the approximate latitude of the ship. Since most sea travel was done on an east-to-west axis from common ports, the navigator rarely needed to know the longitude. Simply knowing that the ship was three days out of home port, the navigator would know the approximate number of days left in the voyage. The navigator did need to know how far north or south he or she was from the destination.\\
<wrap indent>A magical astrolabe allows a navigator to know exactly where the ship is, both in longitude and latitude, without having to make exact measurements and precise calculations.</wrap>

Celestial
**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 8,000
War Captain’s Companion
//Celestial astrolabes// are large, fixed devices. They are used to display the location of astronomical bodies of Class A and larger. These fixed astrolabes display a large, spherical projection, and must be used inside a crystal sphere, in a dark room, or during the night, when no lights can disturb the picture. The item creates a three-dimensional picture, exactly to scale. The astrolabe shows the orbital path and the current location of every large or major celestial body in the crystal sphere. The 3-D picture perfectly fits the room it is in, or a radius of 30 feet, whichever is smaller.\\
<wrap indent>The points of varying colors of light a fixed astrolabe creates, show the motions and colors of all planets, moons, suns, asteroids, and comets (though some anomalies cannot be penetrated). A small point of white that blinks once every second shows the relative position of the astrolabe in the system. This is often used in navigation rooms to check course changes and verify headings.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>A //celestial astrolabe// always operates, and cannot be turned off. Merely bringing a light source into its room, however, is enough to nullify the faint picture it presents. Thus conferences and meetings can be held in a room with an astrolabe without the attendees realizing one is present.</wrap>

The //astrolabe of Henrik// is a cursed item of great power. When activated, it sends the user and everything within 10 feet of the user, to the nearest cursed location or to a place enchanted by evil. The //astrolabe of Henrik// usually sends people to the Hollandes, but the DM is free to send the characters anywhere. The device itself does not go with the transported party.

of Entrapment
**XP Value:** 10,000 **GP Value:** 100,000
A Dozen and One Adventures
Only a handful of these powerful items exist. They appear to be metal, spherical astrolabes, inscribed with the locations of constellations and planets. Like all astrolabes, they are useful to wizards with the astrology proficiency, who can use the device to determine the hour, date, and location in terms of degrees latitude (each requiring a successful ability check). In addition, this item magically draws power from the motion of the stars and planets in the heavens and uses the energy to imprison genies.\\
<wrap indent>An //astrolabe of entrapment// contains 12 genie prisons arranged in an elaborate mechanism inside its metal sphere. As the constellations wind their paths across the night sky, the inner cycle of prisons slowly revolves. Only one genie prison in the device is active in any given month. During that time, the owner of the astrolabe may employ any or all of its three functions:</wrap>\\
* Summon the genie trapped within the active prison. Roll on the following table to determine each of the 12 prison contents:

^ Roll ^ Type of Genie |
| 01-20 | None. The trapped genie was released. |
| 21-35 | Dyjinni. |
| 36-55 | Dao. |
| 56-75 | Efreeti. |
| 76-90 | Marid. |
| 91-96 | Tasked Genie (DM’s choice). |
| 97-00 | Noble Genie (DM’s choice). |

<wrap indent>Once called, there is an 80% chance that the genie can be commanded to perform certain actions for the owner of the astrolabe, but there is a 20% chance that the trapped genie is so enraged that it attacks whoever is within reach for 2d12 rounds before the power of the astrolabe prevents further havoc. In these rare instances, the berserk genie may never harm the owner, though any nearby friends and family are fair game for the genie’s retribution. A trapped (and obedient) genie can only be summoned from its prison once per day to perform a specific task for its master.</wrap>\\
* Free the genie trapped within the active prison. This might be risky, for once the genie is free, nothing can prevent it from seeking revenge on its previous master, the master’s friends, and family. Usually, fear of further imprisonment within the astrolabe keeps the genie from immediate, direct vengeance.
* Trap a genie within the active prison. This function can only be used on a single genie within 30 feet of the astrolabe. The victim is entitled to a save vs. spell at a -6 penalty. If it fails, the genie is imprisoned and any genie previously trapped in the active prison is automatically released, with the consequences described above. If a genie makes its save, it is immune to the effects of the astrolabe for a full calendar month and during that time seeks to destroy both the device and its owner.
<wrap indent>At the end of each month, the current prison deactivates for the next 11 months, trapping the genie inside with no chance for release until the clockwork prison mechanism inside the astrolabe has made another complete revolution. Most genies are aware of the 30 days of “parole” from their cyclical prison, and seek to convince the astrolabe’s owner to release them during that time by swearing oaths and pleading with promises of good behavior.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Although powerful divination spells might hint cryptically at an astrolabe’s prisoners, the DM should never reveal what genies are trapped within an astrolabe when it is discovered.</wrap>

===== Awl =====

An awl is a common leather working tool—a metal spike 3 inches or more in length with a wooden handle. Though normal awls are common, magical ones are not. Roll on the table below to determine what is found.

If this item is held and the command word spoken, it attracts the attention of an Immortal or a deity (a powerful being from the Outer Planes, immune to all character attacks and spells, with very great powers). This being’s actions are determined by rolling 1d6, using the chart below after applying the following adjustments. If the user is magically cursed when the awl is used (however minor the curse), or is Carrying a //cursed// item, a -1 penalty applies to the roll. If a //wish// is cast before the awl is used, //wishing// for good fortune, a +1 bonus applies. After the awl is used, there is no way to alter what occurs. The awl may be used once a year. The 1d6 table below is adjusted for the modifiers.

^ Roll ^ Immortal Reaction |
| 0 | Appear and then depart with both the character and the awl. (The character can only be retrieved by others, who must first regain the immortal’s attention and then please the creature with a great service or sacrifice). |
| 1 | Appear, slay the character (no saving throw), and depart, leaving the awl. |
| 2 | Ignore the summons (nothing happens). |
| 3 | Appear, take the awl, and depart. |
| 4 | Answer any three questions for the user, take the awl, and depart. |
| 5 | Raise any one ability score by three points (to a maximum of 18), as desired by the user; the immortal takes the awl and departs. |
| 6 | Grant one //wish// to the holder and depart, leaving the awl. |
| 7 | Replace the user’s //wish// (usable any time thereafter), grant one other //wish// (made at that time), and depart, taking the awl. |

When this awl is inserted into a skin containing one or more drops of water, wine, or oil and the command word is spoken, it causes the container to fill completely with the same liquid. Only non-magical liquids can be affected by the full awl.

Inn

This item creates an apparently normal door out of thin air, on command. The door may be opened easily, and remains open for one turn. Anyone passing through the door arrives in a safe, friendly inn, where food, drink, and a good night’s rest may be had (though at 10 times normal prices). The inn contains one manager, one chef, one barkeep, 50 furnished rooms, and 1d20 other visitors of various races (NPCs and monsters alike). At least one of each category also possesses an awl. It is magically impossible for any visitor to disobey the Manager or to attack or steal from the inn or from any other resident. There is only a gray mist outside of the inn, and the mist cannot be entered. All visitors leave the inn after breakfast (no saving throw). The awi/ inn may be used only once per week.

Mess

This item has no intrinsic value. When a magical //dinner plate// is tapped by the awl, it produces five times the given amount of food, 15 meals per day instead of three—but just for that day. However, each diner must make a saving throw vs. spell while eating; failure indicates that the food spills out, staining the diner’s garments permanently unless washed with //soap of washing//. The mess awl may be used as often as desired.

Out
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 5,000
POLYHEDRON Newszine 23
When touched, this item forces the victim to immediately leave the dungeon in which the aw! is found, by the fastest available route. No saving throw applies, and the victim attempts to avoid all encounters until he or she is outside again. The victim may fight normally if cornered, but cannot stop to pick up any treasure. The //awl out// may be kept by the victim, and functions as a normal awl thereafter, as long as it is physically touching the victim. Note that if the awl leaves the victim’s hand or skin at any time, its original power returns.

===== Axe =====

Axes are woodcutting instruments with sharpened metal or stone heads and wooden handles. Axes are also used as weapons of war. War axes come in all sizes, from small hatchets and throwing axes to two-handed great axes. Many magically enchanted versions exist, particularly among the dwarves.\\

Azuredge, Slayer of the Netherborn
**XP Value:** 7,000 **GP Value:** 35,000
New Item
//Azuredge// is a medium-sized battle axe forged of silver, electrum, and steel alloys, its handle cast from solid steel and wrapped at the haft in blue dragon skin. There is a star sapphire set into the pommel. It is as effective as a pure silver weapon and is magically enchanted with a number of powers, the least of which cause the edges of the axehead to shimmer a deep blue at all times. The axe has six runes carved into it, one along each edge on either side of the axe and one rune at the center of each side of the axe. At various times, the runes flash with blue radiance (apparently when their powers are active). Smaller runes are also carved into the handle, but these are only noticeable under close scrutiny. Though the wide, double-edged axe appears quite heavy and unwieldy, it is light and well-balanced in the hands of its chosen wielder.\\
<wrap indent>//Azuredge's// origins are even more tightly tied to the City of Splendors than some suspect. A little over 300 years ago, Aghairon was marshalling his power as the premier wizard of Waterdeep under the just, though violent, rule of Lady Lauroun, Warlord of Waterdeep. Aghairon saw the last honorable Warlord of Waterdeep fall in battle, her body pierced by a score of orcish arrows. //Teleporting// her from the field, he performed her last request, “to ensure that she would always be able to aid the defense of the City of Splendors.” Having been preparing a magical axe to present to her, Aghairon’s magic bound a piece of Lauroun’s fleeting spirit to the weapon, making her forever an intelligent, soulful presence in an item capable of fulfilling her last request. Though its memory is not fully Lauroun’s, //Azuredge// remembers her creation and history as a weapon.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Though powerful and eager to be used in the city’s defense, //Azuredge// waited six long years before her initial use. Upon Aghairon’s establishment of the Masked Lords’ Rule, the blue axe was given to Kherris—a warrior, Lord of Waterdeep, and great-grandfather of Baeron—to dispatch the heinous otherplanar creatures that emerged outside the city. Coming from the ruins of Halaster’s tower, these were the first dangers visited on Waterdeep from Undermountain. Legends tell of a battle late one night, when a flood of ghastly creatures spilled out of Undermountain, intent on the City herself. Aghairon’s magic slowed them but did not stop them all; many reached the city walls only to meet a tall, cloaked Lord holding the glistening, blue axe. //Azuredge// sent all the fiends back to their makers, its glowing blue radiance keeping the evils from Waterdeep.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>The axe was not seen again by Waterdhavians until the time of Baeron, the next open Lord of Waterdeep over 200 years later. After Baeron’s from his belt on the funeral pyre), the axe is not mentioned in any history of the City until Berrygon, a warrior/blacksmith from South Ward, wielded it against Bane’s forces during their invasion of Waterdeep at the Time of Troubles. With Berrygon’s fall, his final companion, the wizardess Caryn, risked a spell to //teleport// the axe to safety, sending it to Blackstaff Tower. Khelben kept watch over //Azuredge//, and added enchantments that allow him to watch over the wielder of the axe as well as to provide the magical effects for her reappearance. Khelben and Piergeiron do not interfere with //Azuredge// and her protection of the City, but they plan on keeping tabs on the axe and her chosen companions, making sure they do not stray from the Lords’ path, whether for Waterdeep’s good or not.</wrap>\\
<wrap indent>Enchanted as it was (“to be as worthy a weapon as its wielder”’), //Azuredge's// powers wax and wane with each new wielder. The blue axe’s full powers and abilities are listed and activated as follows:</wrap>

* The blue axe does not have any combat bonuses for attack or damage, but its magical construction allows it to hit creatures only affected by silver or magical weapons (even those only affected by +3 weapons). Its damage cannot be regenerated save by normal rest, making it an effective weapon against trolls.
* Immediately upon gaining the use of her, the wielder can command //Azuredge// to generate //light// (as the Ist-level spell).
* After reaching 4th level (or wielding her for a year), //Azuredge// can be thrown at targets a number of times per day equal to the level of the fighter wielding her (a 6th-level paladin = 6 throws per day). Other than that and the lack of combat bonuses, this power is identical to an //axe of hurling// (double damage when thrown).
* At 8th level and above, the wielder can use //Azuredge// against undead and creatures from the lower planes as if she were a //mace of disruption//. This power is coupled with //Azuredge's// ability to detect evil planar beings and undead, those creatures she was forged to slay; when- ever in the presence of undead or evil beings from outside the Prime Material Plane, //Azuredge// glows brightly (whether her wielder wishes her to or not) with cold azure flames enveloping the axehead (illuminating a 40-foot-radius).
* //Azuredge// is an intelligent weapon (Intelligence 14, Ego 12) with a female identity, hence the references to the weapon as “‘she.” With sentience, she is the one who chooses her wielder (magically sticking to surfaces like //sovereign glue// until she is touched by one she deems worthy); she also has a limited //detect alignment// ability she uses on her wielders, which aids her in her choice (she chooses only good, most often chaotic, heroes). She chooses a wielder only after the passing of her previous wielder. She can communicate by speech or //telepathy//, though she rarely communicates until the wielder is at least 12th level (any communication before to this is more apt to be heard as whispers or words in a dream), She can also resist identification magic at will, relinquishing only the information she wishes.

a contest to bring the two quarreling factions of
hill dwarves and plainsmen together. Caramon
raised a tall wooden post in a sea of mud, plac-
ing the axe of brotherhood and the sword of
friendship at the top. Whoever climbed the post
could claim the prizes. There was a catch,
though. Not only was the post greased, but Cara-

Cursed Battle
**XP Value:** **GP Value:** 1,000
The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan

This battle axe has a blade of bronze and its hilt is
wound with snake skin wrappings. The axe casts
an ominous shadow—what appears to be a with-
ered arm. Those who approach within reach of it
feel cold chills running up and down their spines.

The battle axe detects as magical. The axe is a
+2 weapon, -2 vs. chaotic evil creatures. The
weapon acts like a cursed sword—once handled
by a character, he or she may never be rid of it, it
always teleports into the possessor’s hand and
welds itself there during encounters. The axe
also chooses to appear in touchy encounters
with lawful good creatures. Beneath the handle
wrappings, a permanent scroll is concealed. The
scroll contains the following spells: passwall,
burning hands, and push at 9th level. This scroll
provides the axe with additional powers when
the wielder pronounces the correct words of
power, up to a maximum of three times a day per
spell. The words of power are engraved on the
axe blade in Olman. The axe may not be used to
attack at the same time that it is being used to
cast a spell. If the scroll is removed from the
axe, the axe loses its abilities forever and the

 

' scroll loses its permanence and becomes an

ordinary scroll.

of the Dwarf Lords
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** —
Book of Artifacts
This is a short-handled axe backed with a clawed
hammer head, the blade is pierced with intricate
runes etched and plated in gold. The axe head
seems extraordinarily flimsy until tested, when
the cunning work of the carving and the temper
of the steel show the weapon’s true strength. The
hammer is made to look like an erupting volcano
with the flames forming the head’s jagged prongs.

Legend says that the axe of the Dwarf Lords is
the last of the Five Great Tools forged by the First
King, after the brutal pick, the Earthheart forge,
the anvil of songs, and the shaping hammer. With
these, Silvervein Moradinson crafted the fierce
axe, the finest of the five.

Silvervein passed the axe on to the Second
King, and so it went through the generations,
until it became known as the axe of the Dwarf
Lords, symbol of the One Clan.

The One Clan was shattered and the age of the
High Kings broken when Brassbeard slew his
uncle, King Irontooth of Moradinson, out of
greed for the axe. The dwarves fell into the chaos
of civil war, and when all had ended, the axe of
the Dwarf Lords was lost forever.

The axe’s power lies as much in what it sym-
bolizes as in its magic, for over the centuries a
legend has sprung up that the return of the axe
heralds the return of the High Kings and a new
Dwarven Age.

Adventures involving the axe can have the
player characters finding the weapon. Only
dwarven PCs should have any idea of the
weapon's importance; to others it is merely a

Axe of the Dwarvish Lords

powerful weapon. From here the PCs can be
plunged into an adventure of dwarven intrigue
and greed as rivals attempt to take possession of
the axe. The duergar may even attempt to steal it
for their own.

The axe should not resurface without cause, so
during all of the intrigue the PCs should discover
a great threat to the dwarves. The clans might
need to be united or the shade of Silvervein sum-
moned to lead a last battle against the foe.

Constant Powers: The axe is a +3 weapon,
functioning both as a sword of sharpness and as a
hammer +3 dwarven thrower. It grants dwarven
detection and vision abilities at double the nor-
mal chance or range.

Invoked Powers: The axe can summon one 16

This axe was forged from the heart of a volcano
by a king of the dwarves long forgotten. It passed
from father to son until it disappeared in battle
over a thousand years ago. Since then it has been
rumored to have appeared in various places
around the world. The axe has all of the fighting
qualities of a sword of sharpness. In addition, it
confers on its user the natural abilities of
dwarves—infravision, the ability to detect slop-
ing passages, traps, and construction.

After prolonged use, it tends to make its user
resemble a dwarf; the user becomes shorter,
stockier, and grows a profuse beard. It also has

of the Emperors

**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** —
Book of Artifacts

The axe of the emperors is a double-edged, two-
handed war axe. The head is of the brightest
adamantite, forged so that it looks like a rising
phoenix, the talons wrapping around the socket to
clutch a sizeable ruby. The bird’s wing feathers
form the serrated edges of the blades. The haft is
a rod of black crystal wrapped in bands of silver.
The crystal enlarges at its base into a carving of a
coiled dragon, a great sapphire clutched in the
creature’s mouth. The item is originally from Tal-
adas on the world of Krynn.

It was in the Age of Dreams, when the ogres
first warred among themselves, that the seditious
Irix called upon the dark gods to give hima
weapon to subdue his fellow Irda. His vile suppli-
cations were heard and the dark gods granted unto
him the means to make the axe of the emperors.

Aided by the axe, Irix plunged his people into
civil war, splitting the good from the evil. The axe
led him to many bloodthirsty victories, but in the
end the combined might of Irda brought him
down. Fearful of the axe, the greatest sorcerers
and sages among the ogres saw to its destruction.
At the end of their mystical workings the axe van-
ished, apparently destroyed.

In truth, the axe still existed, magically cast
away from the ogres to the lands of Ansalon.
There it was found by Ymrald, a green dragon,
who added the treasure to her hoard. Wise enough
to know it was a magical device, Ymrald spent
decades trying to puzzle out its powers before
giving up in frustration. When she died, it passed
to her children. Thus the axe languished for thou-
sands of years, a beautiful curiosity of drag-
onkind.

Such a situation could not last forever, and it
ended when the treasure hoard was ransacked by
a minotaur of spirit and skill, Ambeoutin, from
whom the later emperors take their name. His

cesarean ciara emia emamemcsimmismciimail

raid was no accident, for a sorcerer among his
people had guided the minotaur hero to the
dragon’s lair. Yrmald’s offspring strove to stop the
thief’s escape but they were no match for the
minotaur, now equipped with the axe.

It is said that upon returning to his camp, the
minotaur and his sorcerous mentor spent the night
performing sinister rituals over the magical blade.
Some contend that these gave the axe even greater
powers than it held before; others believe it only
allowed Ambeoutin to master the secrets that were
already there. All agree that with the dawn the axe
glowed with a greater fire than before. In Ambe-
outin’s hands it was an object of power and might.
Minotaurs and ogres kneeled to his cause, all
others fell before the blade’s deadly thirst.

Like Irix before him, Ambeoutin became
unstoppable and through bloody war quickly
carved a kingdom for his people. Unlike Irix, the
minotaur ruled his people harshly but justly. As
his time to die approached, Ambeoutin, once
more advised by his mentor, took up his axe and
disappeared, setting sail for his ancestral home-
land in the east.

The axe of the emperors is a powerful artifact,
but because of its strictures it is not one the player
characters are likely to use. Instead, they are far
more likely to encounter this item either as part of
a long-lost treasure hoard or newly discovered in
the hands of someone else. The axe is an evil item
and should be presented to the characters as
something that must be stopped or destroyed.

One possibility for an adventure is that the axe
has appeared in a relatively quiet backwater vil-
lage and has quickly dominated the local lord, a
weak-willed NPC. Utilizing the axe, he or she is
starting a reign of terror and conquest, though on
a small scale. For the good of the oppressed farm-
ers the player characters must stop this overpow-
ered petty tyrant, even if the tyrant never becomes
a world threat.

For a more dramatic adventure, the player
characters can discover a minotaur kingdom in a
lost valley, a kingdom ruled by the original
Ambeoutin or by a monstrous, deathless parody
of what he once was. The axe has finally seized
the mind of the great minotaur hero, The arrival
of the characters rekindles the urge to conquer
and now this ancient minotaur civilization is
preparing to burst forth in a wave of conquest.
Naturally, it’s up to the PCs to stop things here

and now.

Once the adventure is over, the axe should not be
left in the control of the player characters unless, of
course, their only desire is to destroy it or hide it
away forever. Irda may appear to stop their attempt
to destroy it. The minotaurs just might seek to
enshrine it as a powerful relic of their history,
although they are more likely to use it.

Constant Powers: The axe has all of the prop-
erties of a vorpal sword (+3 bonus to attack and
damage rolls, possibility of severing limbs).
Against ogres and ogre-kin, the bonus to attack
and damage rolls increases to +5.

Invoked Powers: The axe is a powerful symbol
of rulership and might. As such, it has powers
equal to a ring of human influence and is particu-
larly effective against ogres and ogre-kin (-2
penalty to all saving throw rolls). This power can
be commanded at will. The axe can also produce
the effects of a cause fear spell to all within 120
feet (3/day).

Random Powers: Two from Artifact Table
1-02: Combat, one from Artifact Table 1-17:
Movement.

Curse: Created both for and against the ogre
races, the axe cannot be fully used by anyone
without some ogre blood in their veins. Nonogre
characters using the weapon cannot call upon the
axe’s command or fear powers. Furthermore, they
are struck with a degenerative disease that drains
1 point of Constitution per week until the ability
reaches 0 and they die. Once contracted, the dis-
ease runs its course even if ownership of the axe
should change. Mere handling of the axe does not
trigger this effect; the weapon must be used for
some purpose (such as combat). The disease can
be halted by cure disease, but the character can-
not recover any Constitution until a remove curse
spell is also cast. Constitution points are regained
at | point per week.

With its hate-filled creation and bloody back-
ground, it is not surprising that the axe of the
emperors is imbued with a spirit of intense evil
(Int 18, Ego 17). The spirit attempts artifact pos-
session, and once this occurs, the character grad-
ually becomes a triple-strength (12+3 HD) ogre
of lawful evil alignment. Once the transformation
is completed, the character becomes a permanent
NPC. The spirit of the axe seeks nothing but to
kill ogres and their kin. If not quenched in ogre
blood at least once a month, the axe refuses to use
its invoked powers.

Magical weapons possess a dweomer that allows
them to penetrate the magical defenses of crea-

such an axe, for example, has the same chance to
hit a highly magical monster as an ordinary
weapon has to hit a plain, flesh-and-blood crea-
ture, doing as much damage as a plain weapon
would,

For all weapons of enchantment, the XP cost is

or whatever other official magical weapon exists
of that type and is of low value. These weapons
do not lose their abilities when taken to other

add to the weapon’s attack capabilities, rather, it
negates the monster’s defensive capabilities.

A frostreaver is a heavy battle axe made of ice

result of tremendous pressure exerted for cen-
turies. The knowledge needed to create a frost-
reaver is known only to the Revered Priests of the
Ice Folk, the barbarian tribes that struggle for
control of Icewall Glacier. The blades are formed
by using the oil from slain thanoi and other ingre-
dients in a mystical process that hones and flat-
tens the sheet of ice. The priest must work for an
entire month to create the weapon, and even then,
there is only a 33% chance that the weapon is sat-

This appears to be a normal hand axe. With
familiarity and practice, however, the possessor
eventually discovers that the axe can be hurled up
to 180 feet, and it returns to the thrower in the
same round, whether or not it scores a hit. Dam-
age inflicted by the magical throwing attack is
twice normal (2d6 vs. S or M, 2d4 vs. L), with
the weapon’s magical bonus added thereafter.
(For example, an axe of hurling +3 inflicts 2d6+3

"Teresita acticin:

points of damage vs. S-or M-sized creatures and
2d4+3 points of damage vs. creatures of size L if
it hits the target.) The axe causes only normal
damage (plus magical bonuses when used as a
handheld weapon).

After each week of using the weapon, the pos-
sessor has a 1d8 chance of discovering the full

This rare item is simply an enchanted, adamantite

(2d6 against larger than human-sized creatures),
and has a special property—it can pierce magical
defenses.

A creature with a high (20% or more), natural
resistance to magic (such as a dragon of
advanced age) suffers a temporary 10% loss of
personal magic resistance, lasting for one full
turn, after suffering a blow from a pickaxe of
piercing. Such losses are cumulative—three
blows of a pickaxe of piercing robs a creature of
30% magic resistance. This loss is always tem-
porary, even if the creature’s resistance drops to
zero. (A pickaxe of piercing does not cause neg-
ative magic resistance.)

Besides shattering dragonscales, armor, or
solid rock, and sundering magic resistance, the

pointed, double-ended head of a pickaxe of.

piercing is also effective against magical barri-
ers of all sorts—walls, shells, spheres and man-

pickaxe and a barrier has a 10% chance (not

**XP Value:** 6,000 **GP Value:** 65,000
POLYHEDRON Newszine 90
Aeons ago, the dwarves of the north lived in the
kingdom of Delzoun. This realm was peppered
with dwarven citadels, large and small, and their
metal crafts were seldom rivaled. As mining was

~~», Thor's Kiss -

the lifeblood of the dwarves, their mines, espe-
cially those with mithral veins, were the heart of
Delzoun.

As the sturdy folk worked and prospered, the
increasingly frequent raids by orcs and goblins
became a growing nuisance. The humanoid
incursions began to menace the dwarven commu-
nities. After innumerable clashes in the mines of
Delzoun, one dwarven defender crawled out—
and into legend.

Amidst the chaotic frenzy of bloody beards
and flying goblin heads, Tunnelrunner of Clan
Irongrip turned the tables on the evil raiders. The
raging warrior led inspired attacks to the very
hearts of the invaders, his axe permanently
removing evil thoughts from their leaders’ minds
by separating heads from shoulders.

Tunnelrunner continued to roam the fringes of
dwarven society, a free agent in the defense of all
that was good and strong. His fate is unknown,
but stories told by forgelight imply that Tunnel-
runner met his demise when he ravaged the lair of
a large orcish force—alone.

Tunnelrunner did indeed take on a few more
orcs than he and his trusty axe could handle. And
upon his death, Tunnelrunner’s stalwart soul was
gently carried to the mountains of the dwarvish
gods by the scarred, leathery hands of Clangeddin
Silverbeard himself. At Tunnelrunner’s behest, a
portion of his spirit was channelled into his old
axe, so that he could continue to protect his
people.

The weapon appears to be an old dwarven
battle axe, showing only faint enchantment
magic if checked. It has a head of polished steel
and a very keen edge. The haft is of stout oak,
deeply stained from the axe’s grisly past. It is
shod with a beaten steel cap that resembles a
dwarven helmet. Among the many scores and
notches on the haft is carved the original owner’s
name—Tunnelrunner. These letters cannot be
removed or defaced by any means short of
destroying the axe.

Any good dwarf who holds the axe and speaks
the name “Tunnelrunner” hears the dwarven
hero’s voice mentally. The hero tells of past bat-
tles and the axe’s magical nature, and urges that
the wielder continue to defend against evil. The
axe’s enchantments then reveal themselves.

The weapon is a battle axe +3, Once each day
the wielder can ask the axe to bestow a “tunnel-

running” ability, which lasts for three turns. This

is similar to the spider climb spell, except that the
affected dwarf’s hands need not be empty. With
this power, the axe wielder can run up a wall and
stand freely on the ceiling while continuing to
swing the weapon in combat. The tunnelrunning
ability is not subject to a dwarf’s ability to resist
magic.

Should the wielder ever commit an evil act, or
fail to protect goodly folk against evil, then Tun-
nelrunner ceases communicating. The hero’s
spirit withdraws the enchantments from the axe,
leaving the wielder a simple, worn weapon. If the
wielder atones for his actions, the hero may allow
the enchantments to return.

The weapon is rumored to lie at the bottom of
a “mountain” of orc skeletons. Legends say a
skeletal dwarvish hand is amid the pile, clutching
an old scarred battle axe, its stained oaken haft
carved with the legend “Tunnelrunner” in
Dwarvish runes.

Withering Pickaxe
**XP Value:** 8,000 **GP Value:** 35,000
Nightstorm

At 7th level, a Kirtanta receives a silver pickaxe.
In the hands of a Kirtanta, this weapon acts as an
axe +1, but it can be easily concealed by loose
clothing. The pickaxe also has certain magical
abilities, but these only function for the individ-
ual for whom the axe was forged. The Kirtanta
cannot use their ability to strike from behind with
the pickaxe.

Once per day, the silver pickaxe can act as a
staff of withering. The aging occurs during a suc-
cessful hit (a saving throw vs. wands negates the
effect), and the withering is in addition to the
damage of the blow.

At 10th level, the withering pickaxe may be
used as a staff of withering three times per day. A
Kirtanta never draws a silver pickaxe in front of
innocent bystanders, except in dire emergency.
Each swears an oath of hatred on a pickaxe: If the
person the weapon was drawn against is not slain,
the Kirtanta will track that individual down and
finish the deed, even if it takes the rest of the
assassin’s life.

woodsman axes which are designed especially for
lumberjacks. Unlike other axes, a woodsman axe
is not a slashing weapon, and it is not balanced
for throwing. The axe was not created to be used

This is an ordinary axe with no magical bonus

attempts to wield this axe, he or she automatically
falls asleep for 1d6 rounds, no saving throw
allowed. This weapon is ineffective against other
dwarves.

Badge |
Badges are distinctive insignia, usually
metallic pins, but sometimes cloth patches or
other small, distinctive items. Assume that a
badge is a metallic pin unless otherwise stated in
the item’s description. Patches must be sewn or
otherwise secured to an exposed piece of clothing
to function. Metallic badges must be pinned to
the outermost piece of clothing for their magic to
be effective. Only one badge may be owned at
one time.

of Freedom

**XP Value:** 500 **GP Value:** 1000
The Ruins of Undermountain
This small pin is fashioned of any metal, and
takes the shape of a pair of tiny wings above an
open shackle. Worn or carried on the person, it
allows that being—or another being touched by
it—to be freed of paralysis, hold, and repulsion
spells and effects, webs of magical or mundane
nature, chains, bonds, and the like. The item does
not make the bearer immune to the above ensnare-
ments. The badge of freedom must be activated
by the conscious will of the wearer, and works
only once, vanishing when activated in a wink of
white light.

of Monster Control
**XP Value:** 200 **GP Value:** 1,000
DUNGEON Magazine 11
These badges were used during the construction
of the secret conventicle to gain control over the
monstrous denizens of the sewers. Each gives its
wearer the ability to control any monster, up to a
total of 30 Hit Dice, within a 60-foot radius. It
allows communication with monsters—control is
otherwise identical to that of charm monster (no
saving throw). It cannot control humans, demihu-
mans, or creatures with Intelligence of 12 or
above who have more than 6 Hit Dice. The con-
trol includes humanoids—goblins, orcs, and

gnolls.

Appearing as an ordinary leather backpack, this

allows up to 30 cubic feet of material to be placed
in it, if no single object is more than 5 feet in
length. There is no reduction in the weight of the
materials carried, however.

**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 5,000
DUNGEON MASTER Guide

This bag, constructed of heavy cloth, is about 2
feet wide and 4 feet long (the size of any other
large bag or sack), A character who opens it will
find several large, pebble-like objects inside. If
spilled out of the bag, they explode for 5d4 points
of damage each. All creatures within a 10-foot
radius must successfully save vs. spell or suffer
full damage. For safe removal, the beans must be
taken from the bag by hand—+elekinesis won’t
prevent them from exploding, trying to work
them out with tools is also useless. If planted and
watered, each bean “sprouts” a creature or object.
Bags of beans generally hold 3d4 beans, only one
or two of which are beneficial, the others sprout-
ing monsters or useless things. For example:

at its center into magical dust (appear-

The following list has been conjured to function
as an alternative whenever a bag of beans is used.
If it seems that most of these effects are harmful,
remember that the bag is an item used only en
extremis or out of great curiosity. All magical
effects are assumed to be cast at the 1 2th-level,
unless otherwise specified. Just roll 1d100 for
each bean. References for the statistics of most
monsters and spells are to be found in the appro-
priate AD&D manuals. Unless otherwise noted,
all items and beings created by beans are perma-
nent and may be destroyed or slain normally:

as the 7th-level wizard spell of the same
name. If the powers are annoyed, the
bean planter is attacked by three water
weirds (AC 4; MV 12; HD 3 + 3; hp 16;
THACO 15; SA drowning).

A stone statue in the exact likeness of
the bean planter grows from the ground.
It makes all sorts of verbal threats
against the planter, but it does nothing
more. If left behind, it will direct any-
one who will listen to its lies to attack
the planter. Worse, it always knows the
exact location of the planter.

A female arm wielding an impressive
sword of random type thrusts up from
the ground in the style of the famous
Lady of the Lake and Excalibur. The
sword can be taken only by the bean
planter, after which the arm descends
back into the earth. If the planter is a
paladin, this is the moment to give him
or her a holy avenger; otherwise, the
weapon is a sun blade (See Sword).
The planted bean summons a meteor
from outer space that strikes the ground
within five rounds. Anyone standing
directly over the bean (the point of
impact) is killed instantly, with all items

destroyed. Only a wish can restore life
to the victim. All creatures within 30
feet receive 10d4 hp damage (save vs.
breath weapon for half damage)—a
crater 10 feet in diameter is left behind.
A special bush grows with fire seeds, as
the 6th-level priest spell; 1d4 missiles
and 2d4 incendiaries can be picked.

A minor death (AC -4; 33 hp; MV 24;
strikes with a pitchfork for 2d4 hp dam-
age, never misses, always strikes first in
a round and always pursuing); appears
and attacks the bean planter as if he
drew the Skull card from the deck of
many things. Only one such creature
appears, but the blows and spells from
the planter are the only ones that can
affect this being.

A wall of thorns springs up instantly in
a 20- by 20- by 20-foot cube, trapping
all creatures in this area.

A wondrous, articulate war horse
appears and offers the planter of the
bean a ride to any destination. If the
offer is accepted, the horse takes its
rider to the floor of The Gray Waste’s
first layer, then disappears. If the offer
is not accepted, the horse disappears.
An iron golem pops into existence and
attacks all nearby living things one by
one. In its forehead are set three gems:
a gem of brightness, a gem of seeing,
and a gem worth 5,000 gp.

A chariot of Sustarre (as the 7th-level
priest spell) is conjured to serve the
planter of the bean for 18 turns. Then it
explodes in a 6d6 hp fireball Those on
the chariot take maximum damage, no
saving throw allowed. This could prove
even more deadly if the chariot is being
used in the sky when it blows up.

An ancestral spirit of the bean planter is
summoned. If the DM feels the planter
has been faithful to his or her align-
ment, the ghostly ancestor rewards the
descendant with 10,000 experience
points. Otherwise, the spirit strips away
a like amount from the planter and
gives a warning to the planter to change
his or her ways.

A single campfire springs forth. Its

flames are blue but otherwise normal.

A huge, gaudy marble fountain, deco-
rated with nymphs and dolphins, rises
from the earth, spraying water high into
the air. A few copper coins (1d4+1) can
be found in its basin. The fountain
ceases after 2d6 rounds. If cast indoors,
the fountain fills the room in which it
appears to a height of 20 feet.

A creeping doom crawls forth and
moves in a random direction, attacking
all creatures who do not escape its
wrath. Beyond the initial 80 yards, the
insect mass loses 50 of its number for
every 10 yards it travels.

An extradimensional creature appears
as if an iron flask were opened. It is
very angry, totally hostile, and has max-
imum hit points. If “empty” is rolled on
the table, roll again until a creature
turns up; in this case, the monster is
only an illusion.

A well of many worlds opens in the
ground. It can be picked up and carried
away.

A hostile earth elemental (AC 2; MV 6;
HD 16; hp 80; #AT 1; Dmg 4-32;
THAC0 7; SD +2 weapon or better to hit)
is conjured. To make matters worse, the
planter of the bean and the elemental
swap mental consciousnesses. Thus, the
planter’s body goes about pummeling
people, while the planter must make do
with an elemental form. If either the
planter or elemental are destroyed, this
malady becomes permanent. Player and
DM must creativity remedy the situation.
A hole in the ground opens. Out crawls
a wyvern with 500 gp gems for eyes,
the ability to detect invisible objects,
and the ability to breathe a cone of cold
(for 6d4+6 hp damage) once every
other round. When slain, the creature
transforms into harmless blue smoke;
the gems are left behind.

Sixteen thick and thorny vines crawl
from the ground and, with evil sentience,
seek out victims. The vines are 40 feet
long, AC 4, and have 12 hp each. They
wrap around and constrict their victims,
inflicting 2d4 hp damage every round
after the first successful attack.

Flowers shoot up from the ground for

120 yards around the planted bean. On
the following round, they emit clouds of
magical pollen. All creatures in the area
fall instantly asleep for 1d12 rounds (no
save allowed). Some of these creatures
(1d4+1, chosen randomly) are each
granted a limited wish of their own
design, stemming from their dreams.
Have the players describe their charac-
ters’ dreams without knowing the con-
sequences, then tailor the results
accordingly.

Appearing from the ground to attack
the bean planter is a young adult red
dragon. If slain, a magical red ruby will
be found in the muscle of the dragon’s
heart. The ruby acts as a wand of fire-
balls, fully charged.

A cloud of solid fog, 120 yards in diam-
eter and 20 yards high, rises from the
earth, lasting 20 rounds or until dis-
persed. Just 1d20 rounds later, a death

fog spell rises from the earth, lasting

another 20 rounds and having the same
dimensions.

An enchanted heavy catapult appears. It
is +1 to attack and has double normal
range. It fires by itself every other
round, requiring people only to load it.
The catapult also shrinks upon com-
mand to a height of | inch. Once per
day, it can hurl a ball lightning (4d12 hp
damage; see ring of shooting stars for
details).

A huge hemispherical chunk of ground,
150 yards in radius about the bean, rips
itself free from the earth and floats
away. Characters standing on it may be
stranded several hundred feet above the
ground or carried to a foreign land.
Nothing seems to happen. If the planter
digs up the bean again, he or she dis-
covers a nugget of gold worth 50 gp.
Further excavation proves this site to be
a suitable gold mine. Serious digging
may be costly, however, and may also
mean encounters with beings not happy
to see miners (angry duergar, drow, pur-
ple worms, etc.).

Nothing apparently happens, but two
invisible stalkers of maximum hit points

are conjured. They follow the bean

planter and attempt to steal away the
bag of beans at the most opportune
moment. Resistance causes the stalkers
to attack.

A Leomund'’s secure shelter springs
forth. Inside are 2d4+1 trolls of differ-
ent types and maximum hit points who
consider this their home. If the DM
desires, a trapdoor in the floorboards of
the shelter leads to an extradimensional
dungeon of the DM’s own design.

Only 1d4+1 rounds after the bean is
planted, a Daern $s instant fortress grows
upward so quickly that all within 10
yards sustain 10d10 hp damage from its
growth. Whoever planted the bean may
command the fortress’s entrance to
open or close. The fortress is permanent
but can never be moved or shrunk to its
cube form.

A number of toads (1d4+8) crawl from
the earth. Whenever a toad is touched,
it polymorphs into a random monster
(check the MONSTROUS MANUAL acces-
sory and roll on the Monster Summon-
ing Spell Table of the appropriate level
for the party). Every third round, a
toad will polymorph without being
touched.

Immediately after the bean is planted, a
huge tent (30 by 30 by 10 feet) springs
up, enclosing all creatures within its
volume. The tent is lavishly furnished
with velvet pillows, golden lamps,
porcelain vases, exotic tapestries, and
pervaded with the scent of rich spices.
All creatures in the tent are subject to
sympathy, as the 8th-level wizard spell;
those failing to save vs. spell cannot
leave the tent. Anything removed from
the tent turns into scraps of paper,
sticks, rocks, etc. unless removed by a
thief, in which case they remain as they
are. Individual items have values of
100d10 gp each. Each thief may remove
a number of items equal to his or her
level of experience as a thief; after that,
the items not removed by thieves turn
into debris in 1d4 days. The tent van-
ishes after one day.

A mass of 4d6 laughing skulls, flying on
bat wings, spring from the ground and

54

55

56

57

58

59

surround the bean planter. The demonic
laughter prevents any sleep or spellcast-
ing requiring verbal components. For
each day of sleeplessness, the planter
takes a -1 penalty on attacks, defenses,
and saving throws, The skulls cannot be
attacked by any means except one, cho-
sen by the DM (this method may be
uncovered by divination spells). The
skulls remain for 2d4 days, then fly away.
They do not interfere in combat, though
some might avoid a victim so affected.
The bean planter receives an unhatched
dragon’s egg of a random type. It
hatches in 2d6 hours if kept warm.

A wishing well springs up. It grants a
wish to the first person who tosses in a
coin and to a second person who dumps
in at least 1,000 gp worth of coins or
treasure. The well disappears after the
second wish.

A great fissure in the ground opens. It
is very narrow (only 4 feet wide), so the
bottom cannot be seen. Nothing other
than possible injuries can come of
climbing down into the crevasse, which
is 1d4 miles deep and 10d12x100 yards
in length. After 5d4 days, the crevasse
closes again, swallowing anything
within it.

Mist rises from the ground and, after
1d4+1 rounds, takes on the form of a
dragon. The “dragon” breathes a blast
of steam and vapor in a cone 40° long
and 20’ wide upon any creatures nearby.
Damage is 6d6 hp. After it breathes, the
dragon-cloud dissipates. It cannot be
attacked except by magical electricity,
which causes the cloud to fade away
while it is forming—only to reappear
behind the bean planter 1d4 hours later.
A rope grows upward to a length of 30
feet. If anyone climbs the rope, an
extradimensional space is found (as the
rope trick spell). It lasts for four hours,
after which the rope assumes the abili-
ties of a rope of climbing.

A beanstalk grows up into the air. If
climbed, it leads either to a cloud castle,
to wildspace (for a Spelljammer”
adventure), or to a different plane of

existence (a PLANESCAPE™ adventure

in a cloud city on the Elemental Plane
of Air?).

A lesser basilisk of average hit points
crawls from the ground. Its gaze attack
does not turn people to stone, but it
ages them 5d10 years. The basilisk
wanders away after a turn.

An umber hulk of maximum hit points
digs its way out of the earth, then
attempts to maim or kill as many char-
acters as it can before burrowing back
into the ground 1d100 rounds later. If
slain, the umber hulk changes color
uttering one prophecy before it turns
into dust. The prophecy always comes
true (the DM should use a lot of imagi-
nation here).

An entire one-story tavern pops up
from the ground. The pub’s interior is
occupied by helpful unseen servants
who dish out helpings of a hero’ feast.
This tavern remains in place for 3d4
days before vanishing.

An insane gynosphinx (maximum hit
points) appears and attempts to devour
any creatures who cannot answer its
silly children’s riddles.

The area about the bean within a 1d4
mile radius suffers its own chaotic
weather patterns. The weather changes
every turn for 4d12 hours. Choose
weather types randomly from those
listed in the 7th-level priest’s spell, con-
trol weather.

A patch of pumpkins, 40 yards square,
grows instantly. The pumpkins ripen,
overripen, go foul, then burst open.
Everyone in the area is affected by a
stinking cloud spell and must save vs.
breath weapon or contract a debilitating
disease (see the 3rd-level priest spell
cure disease for details). However, 1d6
pumpkins do not explode, but they
instead turn into scarecrows (see the
MONSTROUS MANUAL accessory) of
maximum hit points, and they will
attack the party after two rounds. If
they slay the PCs, these monsters roam
the land.

The planted bean becomes a delayed
blast fireball of 18th level, exploding in
five rounds.

The DM’s favorite dinosaur (maximum
hit points) grows out of the ground to
create a little havoc among the PCs.

A squirrel or other woodland creature
comes along, digs up the bean, and
quickly devours it. The animal then
addresses the bean planter in Common
and may answer questions as a sage
skilled in every field of knowledge. If
the planter has no questions, the animal
will give clues to the location of a mag-
ical artifact. One hour after eating the
bean, the animal reverts to normal,
though it now follows the PCs wherever
they go (it does nothing else).

A female vampire exits the ground at
nightfall, wielding a vorpal weapon and
a rope of entanglement to track down
and kill the bean planter. She requires
no coffin, staying in gaseous form for
12 turns when slain, reforming after
that. Her magical items may be gath-
ered as treasures.

A huge eyeball 1-foot in diameter rises
from the ground and floats 6 feet in the
air, All who gaze upon the eye must
save vs. petrification or be transformed
into (Roll 1d8):

A statue of wax

A statue of wood

A statue of glass

A statue of ice

A statue of gold

A statue of lead

A statue of iron

A statue of salt

This can only be reversed with a wish.
A pyxis, a unique wooden box of intri-
cate design, appears in place of the bean
(it must be dug up). It is worth 5,000 gp.
If it is opened, a horde of 10d10
grotesque monsters pours from the box
at the rate of 1d4 monsters per melee
round. The pyxis can be shut only with a
Strength roll to bend bars and lift gates.
These monsters could include aboleths,
beholders, bulettes, giant crabs, giant
crayfish, giant leeches, otyughs, remor-
haz, ropers, rust monsters, giant scorpi-

trackers, giant slugs, thessalmonsters,

Immediately after the bean is planted, a
rumbling in the earth is heard. On the
next round, a herd of albino mastodons
is seen stampeding toward the area of
the bean. How many they number and
how far away they are depends on party
strength and conditions of the environ-
ment. The mastodons have average hit
points. Their tusks have normal value
for ivory.

A cagelike throne appears. It allows
travel into the Ethereal and Astral
Planes at will, for one person only. It
cannot be moved from the spot on
which it appeared by any means. The
throne may be used 1d4 times before it
vanishes again,

This bean summons a kender handler
from the DRAGONLANCE setting of
Krynn. The kender may either be
adopted as a normal player character, if
a player for is available, or may be run
as an NPC. The kender is of the same

level as the rest of the party and has no
magical items or treasure—but will
soon!

A hostile skeletal creature crawls out of
the ground. The creature has all of the
same abilities, statistics, and posses-
sions as the bean planter (as a mirror of
opposition) and wears black clothing or
armor similar to that worn by the
planter. The beast attacks the planter
and disappears, with all its items, once
slain. Only spells and attacks from the
planter affect it.

A renegade leprechaun appears for one
hour. It is dressed in red clothing and
speaks in a normal Common accent. If
upset, it attacks with its special ability
to use wizards’ symbols (any except a
symbol of death; usable once per round,
one symbo/ at a time, inscribed in the
air). If given a magical item that is not
cursed, the leprechaun grants a limited
wish, then vanishes,

A harp floats up from the ground and
plays by itself, filling the air with soft,
gentle music. All within 60 feet must
save vs. spell or succumb to a magical
effect (sleep, fear, confusion, or other)
that lasts 2d8 rounds.

The ground in a 60-yard radius around
the planted bean oozes with a bubbly
tar. A creature must roll a strength
check every round to successfully
move. Movement is cut down to 4 nor-
mal anyhow.

A hollow sphere of iron, 30 feet in
diameter, with the planted bean at its
center, is conjured. It imprisons any
creatures within that area. Note that
half the sphere is hidden beneath the
ground.

A giant oak tree grows with 10d10
acorns made of different substances—
glass, amber, chocolate, jade, etc. The
value of any one acorn is no more than
100 gp. The tree grows normal acorns
once all of the unusual acorns have
been picked or have fallen.

A wall of stone appears 500 feet in the
air, above the area where the bean was
planted, and it starts to fall. The square

wall is 3 inches thick and 20 feet on a
375

side. Though it does great amounts of
damage (20d10 hp; saving throw vs.
death magic required if 50+ hp taken)
to anything it lands on, only the very
slow or very stupid should be unable to
get out of its way. Have each character
near the bean make an Intelligence
check on 1d20 to notice the falling wall
or its shadow and escape.

A nest of 1d4+3 eggs springs from the
ground. If an egg is eaten, a save vs.
poison must be made. The person gains
a point of Intelligence if the save is suc-
cessful, but dies otherwise.

A pillar of stone 30 feet in diameter
rises from the ground and lifts all crea-
tures in the area 100 feet into the air.
The pillar vanishes in 1d4+2 turns,
dumping anyone still on it.

A simple silver headband appears on
the head of the bean planter. It cannot
be removed, and it reduces the charac-
ter’s level to zero. The planter retains all
acquired hit points and ability scores,
but is effectively a normal being. The
person may assume a new profession
and gain experience and levels in this
class. The DM may allow the character
to later perform a difficult quest for a
patron deity or alignment. At the com-
pletion of the quest, the silver headband
disappears forever, and the character
can add the new experience point total,
keep the original profession, or keep
both classes.

An area 30 yards in diameter about the
bean turns into a sand pit. All creatures
within that area must make Dexterity
checks or be drawn all the way down to
its center. There, lying in wait, is
either—an ant lion of maximum hit
points, an underground cavern, ora
one-day gateway to another dimension.
The bean transforms into a ball of soft
pastel light that floats up from the
ground and approaches the nearest
character. If the light is allowed to
touch a character, each item worn must
save vs. disintegration or be transmuted
into nonmagical glass. But the charac-
ter adds one point to the lowest ability
score.

87

The planter becomes imprisoned within
the bean. Crystal balls and various div-
ination spells reveal what happened to
the character. The person can be freed
of the bean only by the spells wish or
freedom, or if another creature volun-
teers to take the character’s place.

The bean turns into a black-purplish
gem, shooting up from the ground and
embedding itself in the bean planter’s
forehead, inflicting 1d12 hp damage.
After that, whenever the character is
injured, the gem drains any charged
magical items, such as wands, within
20 feet of his or her person. For every
charge drained, the character is healed
for | hp. Only one charge is drained per
round. This is not a voluntary power; it
occurs whether the character wills it or
not. As side effects, the character’s eyes
turn blood red, fingernails grow long,
teeth become pointed, and the planter’s
hair grows white. These effects can be
undone only with a wish, but the char-
acter is otherwise unaffected.

Some creatures within 120 yards of the
bean shrink while others grow:

01-50 Creature shrinks to 50% of
normal size.
51-00  Creature’s size doubles.Both

effects last 12 turns.

A tombstone springs up with the name
of the bean planter engraved on it. The
character faints for 2d4 rounds, unless
aroused earlier. For 1d4 weeks after-
ward, the planter has a -4 penalty to all
saving throws against magical fear.

The bean becomes a powerful magnet,
drawing all ferrous metallic items within
60 feet into it. All characters in metallic
armor are held paralyzed until helped
out of the armor. Metallic items can be
pulled out of the area of effect only with
Strength rolls to bend bars and lift gates.
All items are considered 10 times their
normal weight when carried from the
magnet within its area of effect. The
magnetic effect ends in 24 hours. The
bean then turns into a 5,000 gp gem.

A disembodied, fanged maw appears in
the air 4 feet off the ground; only the
huge teeth are visible. The mouth,

which cannot be harmed in any manner,
opens to reveal a small, extradimen-
sional space. Inside the space may be a
large cache of gems, several small mag-
ical items, or one powerful magical
item. Reaching in to snatch items
requires a Dexterity check on 1d20.
Failure indicates the mouth snaps shut
on the character’s arm, inflicting 4d10
hp damage and injuring the limb so
badly that only a heal spell restores it.
Nonliving items thrust into the maw are
bitten in half and destroyed. The mouth
vanishes after 10 rounds.

A rolled-up tapestry appears. Engraved
within its pattern is a symbol of death.
The tapestry also shows a fairly accu-
rate map to an ancient, undiscovered
treasure horde (but not an unguarded
horde).

An ogre wizard suddenly appears over
the planted bean and attacks the planter
of the bean. Besides its normal powers,
an ogre mage can use any power that is
used upon it. For example, it could cast
a spell previously used against it or
attack several times in one round if
attacked by someone with the same
ability. The ogre mage uses a randomly
determined, magical polearm that may
be gained as treasure.

A seemingly normal apple tree grows.
It holds 1d10+20 fruit, 2d4 of which
will behave as randomly determined
magical potions or elixirs (not oils) if
eaten. At least one apple is poisonous.
While a person picks apples, branches
in the tree quietly attempt to steal small
trinkets from the character. The
branches have an 80% chance to pick
pockets, taking one item per round and
hiding such items among its leaves. The
tree and all stolen items vanish after
one hour, though any apples picked
remain behind, staying fresh and retain-
ing all powers for one month.

A small pyramid bursts upward from the
ground. If its simple interior is investi-
gated, a mummy with maximum hit
points is found, wielding a fully charged
staff of withering and talisman of ulti-
mate evil. If the mummy is slain, it turns

into gold dust worth 1d10x1,000 gp.

97 A pair of bulettes with maximum hit
points burrows out of the earth, attack-
ing and devouring as many victims as
they can in 20 rounds, then return to the
earth. If slain, each has a magical shield
of random type as one of its back scales.

98 The area around the bean is struck by a
fire storm (as the 7th-level priest spell).

99 A totem pole grows 20 feet into the
air. A magic mouth on the pole
demands a suitable sacrifice from the
bean planter. If a monetary treasure is
given, the character is given a magical
weapon (roll on the appropriate tables
in the last volume of this encyclope-
dia). If magical treasure is given, the
character is granted a wish that must
be used within the hour, If a sacrifice
is not given, the pole permanently
drains two points from the character’s
main attribute.

00 A two-handed, dancing sword (MV 15;
THACO 13; #AT 1) rises from the
ground and begins to strike at random
targets. Though no physical attack can
harm it, it is affected by magical attacks,
such as fireball, lightning bolt, or trans-
mute metal into wood.

Beltpouch of Disappearance
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** 1,250
POLYHEDRON Newszine 47

This highly dweomered belt pouch acts as a bag
of holding (200 gp), but it is actually cursed.
Once every 24 hours, the pouch opens a rift into
the Astral Plane and dumps its contents, closing
one round later. Living things can fall through the
rift only if they are small enough to fit com-
pletely into the pouch (rats, birds, or characters
using diminutive magic).

Bag of Bones

**XP Value:** 3,000 **GP Value:** 15,000
Tome of Magic
This item, usable only by priests, is a small,
ordinary leather pouch that contains a number
of tiny bones. When the bones are scattered
over a 40 by 20 yard area and the word of com-
mand is spoken, a unit of skeletons immediately
springs from the ground, This unit comprises

skeletons) armed with swords. (The statistics
for this unit are: AD 6, AR 8, Hits 1, ML n/a,
MV 12. Hits from piercing and slashing weap-
ons are reduced by half.)

The unit unconditionally obeys the combat
orders of the priest, never checking morale. The
unit fights until totally destroyed or until the sun
sets (at which time the remaining skeletons crum-
ble into dust). Roll 1d100 on the table below to
determine the type of bag found.

Roll Bag of Bones type

01-66 The bag is a “one-shot” magical item.
Once the bones are used, they are gone
forever.

67-00 The bag magically replenishes itself

every sunset if the bones have been
used.

A bag of bones works only on a battlefield in
the full heat of battle. (For the purposes of this
definition, a “battlefield” is a place where units
are in conflict and where at least 100 individuals
per side are involved.) The unit never splits up,
and obeys no orders other than to enter combat.

Certain war deities may frown upon the use of
undead or conjured troops, believing them to be
unworthy and cowardly. Priests worshiping these
deities may suffer divine consequences if they
choose to use a bag of bones.

In Ravenloft: this bag can be used to create a
small army of skeletons (80 of them). The bag
works only in battles where at least 100 creatures
per side are involved. This condition is rarely met
in Ravenloft. In the rare event that this bag 1s
used, double the normal number of skeletons
appear (to 160). The user must also roll a
Ravenloft powers check.

of Devouring

**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** 1,500

DUNGEON MASTER Guide
This bag is an ordinary sack, which may appear
empty—it might hold beans. The sack is, how-
ever, a lure used by an extradimensional crea-
ture—this is one of its feeding orifices.

Any substance of animal or vegetable nature is
subject to “swallowing” if it is thrust within the bag.
The bag of devouring is 90% likely to ignore any ini-
tial intrusions, but any time it senses living human
flesh within, it is 60% likely to close and attempt to
draw the whole victim in—base 75% chance for suc-
cess less Strength bonus for “damage,” each +1 =
-5% on base chance. Thus, an 18 Strength character
(with +2 damage) is only 65% likely to be drawn
into the bag, while a 5 Strength character (with -1
damage) is 80% likely to be drawn in.

The bag radiates magic. It can hold up to 30
cubic feet of matter. It will act as a bag of holding
(normal capacity), but each turn it has a 5%
cumulative chance of “swallowing” the contents
and then “spitting the stuff out” in some non-
space. Creatures drawn within are consumed in
one round, eaten, and gone forever.

tanned leather, and the straps have brass hardware
and buckles, There are two side pouches, each of
which appears large enough to hold about a quart

2 cubic feet in volume or 20 pounds in weight. The
large central portion of the pack can contain up to
8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. The pack has
an even greater power—when the wearer reaches

This is a common, cloth sack, about 2 by 4 feet.
The bag of holding opens into a nondimensional
space, and inside it is larger than the outside. No
matter what is put into it, the bag always weighs a
same amount. This weight, the bag’s weight limit
for contents, and the volume limits are deter-
mined by a percentile roll and consulting the
table below:

other sack normally found in a market square.
However, if a detect magic spell is cast, a faint
aura of evocation magic is discovered,

The sack can hold any mundane or magical
items placed within it—to the normal capacity of
the bag. However, its magical nature cannot be
called into play unless it is empty. When placed on
the ground and the word “backpack” is spoken, the
bag of many bags transforms into a normal canvas
backpack. The words “flask,” “small sack,” “large
sack,” “belt pouch,” “bucket,” “vial,” and “water
skin” have like effects on the bag.

Noj’s Bag of Misplacing
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** 500
1992 Fantasy Collector Card 381

Noj “the Double-Edged” thought that this item was
a bag of holding until it lost half his equipment. A
bag of misplacing is like a bag of devouring except
nothing disappears forever in it (and it doesn’t seem
interested in devouring Noj, either). The bag
merely misplaces items for random periods of time
(usually when they’re most needed). The upside of
this bag is that it is very old and has misplaced
some interesting items. When Noj reaches in for an
item, he could come up with anything, including
(randomly rolled) magical items (60% chance). Of
course, some of them may be cursed!

Pictish Bag of Fiends

This magical device summons 10d10 creatures

seals with beeswax. The fiends. are half man, half
bird, with 35 hit points. They are as strong as a
fire giant and will not attack anything lying flat
on the ground. Their saving throws and attack
rolls are comparable to 5th-level warriors.

of Plenty

The Book of Marvelous Magic

This pouch is small and can hold only 100 gp at
most, If the user places up to 10 coins within the
pouch and leaves it closed for 24 hours, the pouch
changes the coins to the next higher value. Thus,
10 cp can be changed into 10 pp by leaving them
in the pouch for four days. No change occurs if
more than 10 coins are left inside. The pouch can-
not affect platinum pieces. The upgraded coins
may be used normally, and are not magical.

Pouch of Accessibility

**XP Value:** 1,500 **GP Value:** 12,500
DUNGEON MASTER Guide

This normal-seeming pouch is actually a strongly
magical item that can contain up to 300 pounds in
30 specially constructed pockets. Each pocket
holds a maximum of 10 pounds, or | cubic foot
of volume, whichever is reached first.

This device also enables the possessor to open
it and call forth the items needed. Merely speak-
ing the name of a desired object causes it to
appear at the top of the pouch, ready for instant
grasp.

These pouches are similar to bags of holding
and portable holes, and the strictures about place-
ment within such magical spaces apply fully. The
pouch weighs one pound empty and four pounds
when filled.

Pouch of Holding

**XP Value:** 800 **GP Value:** 4,000
The Temple of Elemental Evil
These apparently normal leather or cloth pouches
are found in groups of 1d4+2 attached to a belt.
Each pouch can hold 100 gp (or 10 pounds
weight) as if it were a tenth of a pound. However,
nothing larger than | by 2 by 3 inches can fit into
a pouch, and the maximum cubic volume capac-
ity for a pouch is 3 by 6 by 12 inches. (Thus, vials
of holy water easily fit, but, normally, a dagger or
wand would not.)

of Returning

This item is the size of a large sack (capacity 60

causes it to scream, “I am being stolen!” (in

be heard to 120 feet. If its owner holds it and
commands it to be quiet, it obeys, but repeats its
cries if stolen again.

Sleeping Bag of Armor Nullification
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 5,000
DRAGON Magazine 181
The sleeping bag of armor nullification is a good
substitute for the various kinds of armor that
allow their wearers to sleep in them. The power-
ful magic of this bag enables anyone wearing any
suit of armor of any type to sleep in it as though
he or she were unarmored. As with the special
types of armor mentioned earlier, this enables
adventurers camping out in the wilderness to
avoid being attacked in the middle of the night
before they can don their armor. The only prob-
lem is that if the enemy attacks before the warrior
can get out of the bag, he or she is AC 10, since
this bag totally nullifies any armor in it. In some
circles, this is considered a borderline cursed

item.

of Teleportation

**XP Value:** 2,500 **GP Value:** 10,000
POLYHEDRON Newszine 90

A simple, well-made leather bag, roughly 10
inches wide, tall, and deep—a few of them (5%)
are as large as duffel bags. When something is
put into the bag, and its drawstrings are pulled
closed, the item in the bag is teleported without
error to a predetermined location.

Only items that can fit into the bag maybe
teleported. The destination is usually pro-
grammed into the bag during construction. The
location is usually something obscure and
related to the bag’s original owner, such as “the
third floor alcove of Wizzengerd’s tower,” or
“behind the bar at Skully’s.” The location can be
changed or established only via a wish or limited
wish spell.

When a bag of teleporting is found, there is ini-
tially no way to tell it apart from a normal bag.
Individuals using the bag might think it a bag of
devouring, as the items inside disappear. Further,

sess eereenarmememmrmmeemmeall”

there is no simple way to learn where items are
being teleported. Careful use of spells such as
divination, contact other plane, or scrying do
work, however. Bags of teleporting are sought by
thieves who do not want to get caught with stolen
treasure, and by sages who use them for sending
messages.

of Transmuting

**XP Value:** — GP Value; 500
DUNGEON MAstTer Guide
This magical sack appears to be a bag of holding
of one of the four weight-sizes described above. It
performs properly for 1d4+1 uses (or more if the
usages are made within a few days’ time). At
some point, however, the magical field begins to
waver, and metals and gems stored in the bag are
turned into common metals and stones of no
worth.

When emptied, the bag pours out the trans-
muted metals and minerals. Any magical items
(other than artifacts or relics) placed in the bag
turn into ordinary lead, glass, or wood as appro-
priate (no saving throw) once the effects begin.

of Traveling

**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 10,000

The Book of Marvelous Magic
This pouch weighs 30 pounds. It contains iron
rations for one week, an ordinary tent, blanket,
bedroll, tinderbox, cooking utensils, six torches,
six iron spikes, one flask of oil, one lantern, one
full waterskin, one empty wineskin, three stakes
and a mallet, two large sacks, and four small sacks.
Any item may be drawn out at any time and is eas-
ily replaced in the pouch by uttering the command
word. Any attempt to place additional items in the
pouch burst it and scatter the contents.

of Tricks
**XP Value:** 2,500 **GP Value:** 15,000
DUNGEON MASTER Guide

A bag of tricks appears to be a typical sack,
visual examination shows it to be empty when
first discovered. However, anyone who reaches
inside feels a small, fuzzy object. If the object is
taken from the bag and tossed from | to 20 feet, it
turns into one of the animals on the table below.

The animals obey and fight for the individual
who brought them into being. The kind of animal
inside a bag of tricks varies each time an animal

is drawn from the bag.

Bag of Wind

of Vanishing
**XP Value:** 5,000 **GP Value:** 25,000
The Complete Thief’s Handbook

This appears to be a simple pouch capable of car-
rying some three pounds. In fact, it operates as a
bag of holding capable of carrying up to 50
pounds of weight while having an encumbrance
of only three pounds. Furthermore, the bag of
vanishing may have its drawstrings tugged tightly
once per day and it just disappears for six turns;
the equivalent of a rope trick spell will operate on
the bag (although it stays with its owner) and it
also has detection resistance operating on it.

This bag is invaluable for smuggling, as should
be obvious. The only problem is that each time the
rope trick function is used there is a 5% chance
that the contents vanish into the Ethereal Plane and
the bag is empty when it is checked later.

reveals that the cord is woven of special fibers
and, if checked for magic, it radiates faintly.
When a bag of wind is drawn shut, a bow tied,
and a magical word is spoken, the bag fills
with air—appearing then like a normal sack
filled with some kind of goods, clothing, or
light supplies, since it appears lumpy and
weighs only about 14 pounds. The possessor of
the item may at any time loose the bow knot
and release the wind that is contained in the
bag. The command word necessary to release
the wind or winds contained by one of these
bags is usually written upon the container mag-
ically. Of course, the possessor may know the
word in a case where an NPC initially owned
the item.

Each bag of wind can be used a maximum of
four times before its magical powers are lost.
Naturally, any such bag found might have been
previously used, so the number of magical winds
released can vary from one to four. The Bag of
Aeolus is entirely drained if all four winds are
released at once. If any one of the separate
winds has been previously released, the whirl-
wind function of the sack does not work. The
effect of the wind depends upon the type of bag
of wind.

Anytime a magic bag is found you may assume
there is a | in 4 chance that it is a bag of wind
rather than the type shown on the miscellaneous
magic table. Ifa 1 is rolled, it is a bag of wind.
Roll 1d6 and use the table below:

The Bag of Aeolus: This sack contains one
gust of each of the four separate winds (Boreas,
Euros, Notus, Zephynrus) described below.
These can be loosed one at a time, on com-
mand, and the bag retied after each such release.
If the possessor wishes, however, he or she can
release all four winds at once. The release
equals the whirlwind effect of an air elemental,
the whirlwind lasting four rounds; the four
winds increase the strength of any one air ele-
mental in range to a full 8 hit points per Hit

~~», Wind Pouch

Die, despite the number of Hit Dice of the ele-
mental. The range of the released winds is 60
feet. Direction is determined by the mouth of
the bag at the time of opening.

The Bag of Boreas: When this sack is loosed
and the command word spoken, a blast of freez-
ing wind shoots forth. Creatures within 30 feet
take 2d6 hit points of frost damage, those within
30 to 60 feet take 1d6 points of damage. Small
flames and fires of nonmagical nature along the
20-foot-wide course of the wind gust are extin-
guished.

The Bag of Euros: The release of this puff of
air effects an area 30 feet broad by 30 feet deep.
All creatures within this area are affected by a
languor that causes them to deduct one pip from
their initiative dice. They will also be 10% less
likely to react unfavorably and attack unless they
are already angry, hostile, or engaging in combat.
Fires are only fanned by the release.

The Bag of Notus: By opening this sack, the
owner releases a gust of hot dry air that causes
2d4 points of damage to all within 30 feet and
1d4 points of damage to those from 30 feet to 60
feet distant and within its 20-foot-broad path.
Water dwelling creatures take double damage
from dehydration. All fires and flames are
affected as for Boreas.

The Bag of Zephynrus: A gentle breeze
issues from this sack when it is untied, and all
those within its 30-foot broad by 44-foot deep
area of effect are so refreshed that they gain 1d4
previously lost hit points. In addition, all crea-
tures within the area add one pip to their initiative
rolls for the next four turns. Flame and fire are
just fanned by the zephyr’s release.

Wind Pouch
**XP Value:** 1,600 **GP Value:** 8,000
Pirates of the Fallen Stars
This looks like an ordinary leather pouch, tightly
shut and bulging at the seams with contents. It
weighs no more than the leather it is made from,
for the pouch contains enchanted air. Once the
pouch is opened, a magical wind escapes and
does one of three things.

A fair breeze blows a steady wind in the direc-
tion the user wants to travel. This wind is favor-
able and blows for one 24-hour period after it is
released.

A contrary wind blows a steady, if weaker

wind, in the opposite direction from the course

of the ship’s heading. This is treated as an
adverse light breeze, and lasts until the ship puts
ashore and waits one day before continuing its
voyage.

Finally, a storm wind immediately surrounds
the vessel with gale force winds lasting 1d6
hours. These winds require the vessel to make
seaworthiness checks each hour (described in
Movement and Combat in The Pirates of the
Fallen Stars).

In all cases, the wind only affects the user’s
ship. However, other ships within 30 yards (one
hex) of the user’s ship may benefit (or suffer)
from the effects of the wind, if they remain at that
distance.

The content of the pouch is determined ran-
domly, using the following table:

Zadron’s Pouch of Wonders
**XP Value:** 5,000 **GP Value:** 25,000
DRAGON Magazine 62

Zadron s pouch of wonders is a magical grab bag,
and inside is a great variety of magical items. It is
an ordinary leather pouch with a drawstring made
of silk. When found, the pouch is closed, and
examination reveals that it contains a small
object. To use the magic of the bag, a character
must open the pouch and draw the item out. The
first character to do this after the pouch is discov-
ered becomes its owner.

Each pouch produces 1d20+10 items for its
owner and then fe/eports away to another treasure
hoard to be found anew. However, only one item
from the pouch can exist at any given time. Every
time an item is drawn from it, the pouch remains
empty for the next day, but after that there is a 5%
chance per day that another item will appear in
the pouch.

When a new item appears in the pouch, the old
one becomes useless and disappears, but the new
one is ready for use. If an item from the pouch is
destroyed by any other means, or if an item is put
back in the pouch (if possible), it is replaced by a
new item. (This does not apply to some cursed
items; see individual item descriptions.)

The 5% chance for a new item to be created is
always assumed to be rolled at the start of the day
in question. If a new item is indicated, it is cre-
ated immediately—unless the pouch’s owner is
using the item, and the loss of the powers of the
item then would directly endanger his or her life.
In such a case, the creation of the new item can-
not take place until the pouch’s owner stops using
the old item,

If the owner of the pouch is killed, the pouch
teleports away as if it had reached its quota,
and next appears (if ever) in a different treasure
hoard. The pouch does not produce new items
for anyone other than its owner, but the owner
can allow others to use the items taken from
the pouch, However, items being used by other
characters disappear instantly when the cre-
ation of a new item is indicated, despite the cir-
cumstances,

The last item drawn from the pouch (the one
that meets the pouch’s limit) remains in existence
and usable until the next creation of a new item
(according to the 5% chance per day) is indicated.
When this occurs, both the existing magic item
and the pouch disappear. The owner of the pouch

can keep any item from the pouch as long as
desired, subject only to the eventual disappear-
ance of the item.

To find what the pouch contains, roll on the

refer to the specific tables.

Table A: Eggs (Roll 1d6)

All creatures hatched from eggs emerge in the
third round after the egg is drawn from the pouch.
As with all creatures conjured by the pouch,
those hatched from eggs do not age.

l

A copper egg from which a small, young cop-
per dragon emerges. The dragon speaks, uses
magic, and will serve the pouch owner. It can,
however, only be commanded to fight for the
owner three times (battles). Otherwise, it
fights only in self-defense.

A golden egg that hatches a golden-colored
goose. The goose follows the pouch owner
around unless forced to do otherwise, and
appears to be very rare and valuable. There is
a 1 in 3 chance each day that the goose
becomes a living symbol of discord for one
turn at a random time.

A stone egg out of which emerges a full-
grown, hungry xorn. The xorn demands from
2,000 to 8,000 gp value (2d4x1,000) in pre-
cious metal or everything the owner has,
whichever tis least, or else it attacks. It disap-
pears if satisfied,

A white egg from which issues a full-grown
giant eagle. The eagle can speak the owner’s
language and serves the owner on the same
terms as the dragon in A: 1.

A white egg with pink stripes, out of which a
highly intelligent white rabbit appears. The
rabbit can speak the owner's language and will

serve as a scout (or whatever) for as long as
the owner desires. The rabbit is AC 6, 3 hit
points, no attacks, 50% magic resistance.

A glass egg that hatches an unseen servant
(80% chance) or an invisible stalker (20%
chance). Either serve as described in the cor-
responding spells, but duration is unlimited,
except as noted above.

Table B; Gloves (Roll 1d6)
A small, light leather glove that turns into a
pair of gauntlets of ogre power when it is
drawn.
As B: 1, but gauntlets of dexterity are found
instead.
A glove that allows its wearer to cast a push
spell, once per round, for up to six times per
day.
Anyone besides the owner of the pouch who
puts on this glove immediately begins to
choke to death, doing 2d4 points of damage
per round. Only a remove curse, limited wish,
or wish spell prevents the victim’s eventual
death. The glove has no effect when worn by
the pouch owner.
A glove that allows its wearer to cast one of
Bigbys hand spells, except Bighy 8 crushing
hand, once per day.
A glove that, if used in place of a weapon,
causes the wearer’s fist to become a +2
weapon, does 1d4+2 points of damage per hit,
and stuns (for 1d6 rounds) opponents that fail
a saving throw vs. magic when hit. The latter
property is effective only against creatures M-
size or smaller,

Table C: Crystal Spheres (Roll 1d8)
A large crystal sphere that opens to reveal
1d4+1 small (1-inch-diameter) crystals that
glow dimly from within. Any sound originat-
ing within 1-foot of a crystal is reproduced at
the same volume by the other crystals, what-
ever their location, allowing easy communica-
tion over any distance, but not between planes.
A large crystal sphere that opens to reveal a
pair of glass balls, each 3 inches in diameter.
Looking into one of them allows the viewer to
see anything within sight of the other. By turn-
ing the crystal around, the viewer can see an
entire 360 degrees, just as if he or she were
standing where the second crystal lies. The

system works both ways, allowing a creature

holding the second crystal to see the original
viewer. Creatures with infravision can see
through the crystals using tt.

A lens-shaped crystal that allows anyone
looking through it to detect invisibility as the
2nd-level wizard spell.

 

 

 

Anyone besides the owner of the pouch who
holds this 3-inch-diameter crystal becomes
magically imprisoned inside it, but suffers no
other ill effects. The imprisonment lasts until
the crystal disappears of its own accord when
a new item appears in the pouch.

This irregularly shaped crystal begins to glow
with a blue light whenever hostile or poten-
tially hostile creatures are within 50 feet, and
glows more brightly as the hostile creatures
get nearer. It also detects creatures like trap-
pers, lurkers above, and piercers.

A crystal ball 3-inches in diameter. It is usable
by the owner of the pouch, whatever his or her
class.

Also a crystal ball, this item is usable by any
character. However, if anyone but the owner of
the pouch views a hostile creature through the
crystal for 1d4+1 (number changes on each
use) rounds, the viewer is teleported to the
place being viewed—the crystal is not.

causes it to shrink back to normal size. The
boulder does not reach full size in an area less
than 10 feet wide or 10 feet high. Characters
and creatures can be trapped and immobilized
by the expanding stone, but it does not enlarge
enough to cause them actual damage.
A pebble that turns into a stone of controlling
earth elementals,
A stone of good luck (luckstone).
A stone of weight (loadstone)—it seems to be
a luckstone.
A brick of flying—if thrown hard, it flies
through the air.
A large hollow stone that rattles if shaken.
Breaking it open reveals 1d4+1 ioun stones
inside.
A triangular piece of stone that glows with a
purple light. Once the stone is touched by any-
one but the owner of the pouch, the toucher
cannot be rid of it until a remove curse, dispel
evil, or wish spell is used, or until the stone dis-
appears. The stone imparts 50% magic resis-
tance to the holder, allows regeneration of lost
hit points at three points per round, and effec-
tively blinds the holder to the sight of any living
and animate creatures, making the holder +4 on
attack rolls and damage (and all appropriate
penalties). The blindness effect does not extend
to nonliving creatures such as undead or inani-
mate living things such as trees.
A stone that clings to iron or steel by means of
a mysterious, unseen force.

 

Table E: Figurines (Roll 1d8)
A golden lion (only one); (see Figurine, of
Wondrous Power).
An onyx dog.
A serpentine owl.
An ivory goat (one, selected at random).
A marble elephant.

A bronze figurine of a warrior with a word of
415

\
Zadron’s Pouch of Wonders

"lacy ieeeeleelieeeemeeeenereestieeenlineresticeeeelloneeeenemneneenslieneeeeenerealie

command written on the underside of its base.
When the word of command is spoken, the
figurine becomes a real warrior that serves the
owner for up to three turns once each day. The
bronze warrior has the following statistics:
AC --2, 40 hit points, 6th-level fighter,
Strength 18/01, Dexterity 18. The warrior uses
a composite short bow +1, twenty arrows +1,
a long sword +1, and a javelin of piercing.
None of these items are magical in the hands
of other characters.

A jade sculpture of a palace, One turn after
being drawn from the pouch the figurine starts
growing, doubling in size each round until it
becomes a real palace, 200 feet on a side and
100 feet tall at its apex. It will crush other
structures or objects out of the way as it
grows, but it will not grow while the sculpture
is underground.

A limestone figurine of a leprechaun, which
immediately animates into a real leprechaun
when drawn from the pouch. The leprechaun
will plague the pouch owner and only the
owner for the rest of the day, attempting to
steal the pouch at every opportunity (without
bringing physical harm to the owner). If the
leprechaun can steal the pouch, the owner
must catch the leprechaun within the same day
(automatically retrieving the pouch in the act
of catching the leprechaun), or both the pouch
and the leprechaun disappear. The leprechaun
disappears at the end of the day in any event.

Table F: Vials (Roll 1d8)

A small ceramic vial that can hold up to 10
gallons of any liquid without increasing in
size or weight. It draws or pours at the rate of
1 gallon per round, but if the vial is broken the
entire contents of the vial are instantly
released.
A bottle with a label that says “Potion of

.” A stylus covered with ink is tied
to the side of the bottle. If the stylus is used to
fill in the blank, the contents of the vial
become the potion named on the label. Until
then, the vial contains poison.
When this opaque vial is opened, the one who
opened it (including the owner of the pouch)
instantly assumes gaseous form and is sucked
inside the vial. The vial then reseals itself and
flies back into the pouch. The victim can be
released if a character reaches into the pouch,

withdraws the vial, and reopens it. The trap-
ping and releasing powers of the vial work
alternately in this fashion until the item is
destroyed or disappears.

4 An iron flask that will not be empty.

An eversmoking bottle.

6 A wheezing bottle that sucks air or any gas in
and out on alternate rounds, with a capacity
each time of 125 cubic feet. If the bottle is
stoppered at the right moment, it can be used
to store a gas for release later.

7 A vial containing a potion that effectively
raises any character’s levels of experience for
one day, with appropriate increases in abilities.

8 A vial holding a potion that causes the imbiber
to regenerate one hit point per turn, even after
apparent death, for one day. Regeneration does
not extend to magical attack forms that cause
death without doing damage, such as the
druidic finger of death spell; the priestal spell
destruction (reverse of reincarnation); or the
wizard spell power word kill, to name a few.

Table G: Miniature Weapons (Roll 1d10)
All miniature weapons enlarge to the full size of
the normal weapon within one round after being
drawn from the pouch, unless the item’s descrip-
tion indicates otherwise.

1 This miniature boomerang grows into a full
size boomerang. This weapon may be only be
used outdoors or in large open spaces (mini-
mum range 30 feet, maximum 100 feet). It
always hits, does 1d4+1 points of damage, and
returns to the hand of the thrower on the round
after each hit.

2 A small net that enlarges into Zadron'’s net of
apprehending, a special version of the net of
entrapment, It has an Intelligence of 25 and an
Ego of 20, like a magical sword, and victims’
saving throws are at 4. Its purpose is to cap-
ture thieves; when the net is thrown on a thief,
the captured thief is instantly teleported to the
nearest jail interested in the scoundrel. If the
net gains control of the owner of the pouch or
the owner of the net (if it is given away), it
forces that person to use the net against any
thief encountered (possibly another party
member).

3. A small arrow that enlarges into an apparently
normal missile. When fired, this arrow never
misses (although it may not hit the intended

target). If a target is in range, and if the arrow
415

 

144

*
comes to a corner, it turns 90 degrees and con-
tinues on its way, hitting the first character or
creature it contacts, and doing 1d6+6 points of
damage. Fifty percent of these arrows turn
right, 50% turn left. The arrow continues turn-
ing corners to the limit of its range, until it hits
something or can go no further.

A tiny catapult with a command word written
on it. When the command word is spoken, the
model becomes a full-size, heavy catapult.
Speaking the word a second time reduces the
catapult to a miniature again. This process can
be repeated.

A small hammer that enlarges into a dwarven
thrower +3.

A sling of seeking +2, seven sling bullets +2,
and one sling bullet that explodes as a 5 Hit
Dice fireball, as the spell, on impact.

A small sword that becomes a sword of danc-
ing.

A small sword that becomes a luck blade +1
with two wishes, The wishes cannot be used
for selfish purposes, or else the sword van-
ishes and a new object appears in the pouch.
A sword +1 with disarming ability; an oppo-
nent must save vs. magic when hit or drop his,
her, or its weapon. An opponent that has
already lost its weapon must save or lose its
shield. Unarmed opponents or those using
natural weapons are not affected.

10 A club +J that polymorphs its wielder into an

ogre (no system shock roll required) for as
long as the club is held. The wielder always
retains his or her original personality. The
ogre has the character’s hit points, or 33 hit
points, whichever is greater. The club does
1d10+1 points of damage. The polymorphed
character attacks as an ogre if it has 33 hit
points or less, and attacks as the normal char-
acter would if it has more than 33 hit points.

Table H: Bags (Roll 1d10)
A bag of holding.
A bag of tricks.
A bag of useful items, similar to a robe of use-
ful items, but the bag is usable by any class,
and the items in it are miniatures, which
become real items when needed.
A bag, brown in color, which contains two
sandwiches, an apple, and a cookie.
A small sack that is found to contain a small
sack. That small sack is also found to contain

Zadron’s Pouch of Wonders

iii ieee teatime

a small sack ad infinitum.

A bag of devouring.

A magic bag that no one but a dwarf can open.
It contains what appears to be a worn-out
leather belt, two rusty gauntlets, a cheap
blacksmith’s hammer, and a scroll on which
are written the letters “DEEHNRRTU.” When
these letters are rearranged, they spell
“THUNDERER,” the name of the hammer.
When this name is spoken, the hammer
becomes a hammer of thunderbolts, the
gauntlets become gauntlets of ogre power, and
the belt a girdle of hill giant strength. If this
item is drawn a second time, the name of the
hammer will be different, and, of course,
scrambled.

A bag containing a suit of invisible clothing.
Anyone wearing the clothing is made invisible
as a ring of invisibility, but this effect is lim-
ited to persons and creatures acquainted with
the wearer. To strangers, only the clothes are
invisible, not the wearer. Naturally, the magic
clothing does not work if the wearer also
wears nonmagical clothing underneath,

This bag is found to contain treasure. This is
because it is a Bucknard ’ everfull purse. The
money found in the purse, as well as any
money produced by the purse later, does not
disappear when a new item appears in the
pouch.

10 A bag that functions as a bag of tricks until

used in the presence of an enemy. Then it
becomes a bag of monster summoning; the
creature it produces is a hostile monster that
attacks the bag owner and his or her compan-
ions. The monster is selected at random and
will be of a level corresponding to the sum-
moner’s level.

Table I: Cards (Roll 1d8)
A card with a picture of the area where the
pouch owner is standing when the card is
drawn. Anyone studying the card intently for
one round at any time afterward is teleported
without error, to the place pictured.
A card with a picture of fate holding a balance
scale. The DM rolls secretly and determines
whether the card holder (including the pouch
owner) will be +4 or -4 on saving throws for
as long as the card is held (equal chances for
either). If the result is negative, the effects per-
sist until a wish spell is used to negate the

effect or until 2d4 weeks have elapsed, no
matter what happens to the pouch meanwhile.
A card with a picture of a red dragon sitting
on a huge pile of treasure. Writing at the bot-
tom of the card says, “Wish you were here.
Love, Gorgo.”

A card with a spell (level 2-7, of the appropri-
ate class) written on it, usable by the viewer as
if it were a scroll spell. If the pouch owner is a
nonspellcaster, the card is blank until it is
given to a spellcasting character.

A random card from a deck of many things.
All effects and results persist after the card
disappears.

A blank card in which the first viewer other
than the pouch owner is magically impris-
oned, becoming the picture on the card. If the
card is damaged or destroyed, the victim suf-
fers appropriately. The imprisonment lasts
until a new item appears in the pouch.

A set of 1d4+1 magic message cards. When
the command word is spoken, one of these
cards, if a message has been written on it, fe/e-
ports to the hand of the one for whom the
message is intended. An extra card (besides
the 1d4+1 message cards) is provided, con-
taining the command word and other appro-
priate instructions,

A card stating, in prominent letters, that the
pouch owner is wanted dead or alive by the
nearest local authorities, with a picture of the
pouch owner, and offering a 10,000 gp reward.
When this card is drawn, 100 copies of it
appear in prominent places within a 50-mile
radius of the location where the pouch was
opened. The copies do not disappear when a
new item appears in the pouch.

Table J: Ropes and Strings (Roll 1d8)
A rope that allows a rope trick spell to be cast
with it, as a 10th-level wizard, once per day.
Usable by any class.
A rope of entanglement.
A rope of climbing.
A ball of endless string, a sphere of string 4
inches in diameter that never winds down to
nothing, no matter how much string is drawn
from It.
A rope that, when thrown to the ground, ani-
mates and “dances” to the amusement of all.
Lively music from out of nowhere accompa-
nies the dance, which lasts for 1d4+1 turns.

The rope can dance up to three times per day.

6 Arope that, when stretched tightly across a
doorway or corridor, takes on the coloration of
its surroundings to 95% undetectably. When a
creature tries to step across or over it, the rope
animates and acts as though a druidic trip
spell had been cast. Twenty-five percent of
these ropes act like a snare spell instead. Only
the pouch owner or the owner of the rope (if it
was given away) can safely retrieve the rope if
it is of the latter kind.

7 This rope is unremarkable save for the fact
that it constantly /evitates in a vertical orienta-
tion, with the bottom end staying 3 feet off the
ground. Up to 1,000 pounds of weight can be
tied to the rope and supported. If the limit is
exceeded, the rope sinks slowly to the ground
until the excess weight is taken off it. It
requires little effort to pull the rope and its
load along.

8 This rope seems a rope of entanglement until
it is used against enemies, Then it entangles
the one using it (including the owner) and as
many allies as possible.

Table K: Boxes (Roll 1d6)

These are 3-inch-square cubes of an unknown

metal with a round red spot on one face. When

the owner of the pouch presses the red spot, the
magic of the box is activated.

| This cube acts as a limited cube of force.
When the red spot is pressed a field of force
goes up—troll |d6:

1-2: keeps out living matter

3-4: keeps out nonliving matter

5-6: keeps out magic.

Charges operate the same way as with a nor-
mal cube of force. Determine one of the three
effects above the first time the cube is used,
and the cube performs the same way after that.

2 Acube of frost resistance.

3 Pressing the red spot on this cube causes it to
become a 4- by 2- by 2-foot treasure chest on
wheels. The red spot appears on the center of
the lid of the chest. Pressing the spot a second
time causes the chest to become a large,
enclosed wagon, drawn by two draft horses,
with a 4- by 5- by 2-foot locked compartment
built in to it. The red spot appears on the cen-
ter of the lid of this compartment. Pressing the
spot a third time turns the wagon into a 40- by

30- by 10-foot stone cottage with a hearth,
415

 

146

A
furniture, and a built-in stone chest of the
same dimensions as the wagon compartment,
with a red spot on its lid. Pressing this spot
causes the cottage to become a small cube
again. Pressing the red spot 3 times in rapid
succession causes the item to revert to a small
cube no matter what form it is presently in.
Any objects not originally part of the cube,
such as persons who may enter the cottage or
the wagon, are left unchanged and unharmed
when the item changes form. The lone excep-
tion to this is treasure placed in the chest on
wheels, which remains intact when other form
changes occur. Anything in the chest moves to
the compartment in the wagon, or to the stone
chest in the cottage, when the appropriate
form change occurs. The three respective
chests are wizard locked, and only the pouch
owner can open them freely.

When the spot on this cube is pressed, a set of
red numerals appears above the red spot. The
numerals begin with 10 and count down one
number per round after that. Pressing the red
spot again after the first pressing resets the
count to 10, and pressing it 3 times in rapid
succession (within one round) makes the red
numerals disappear. If and when the count
reaches 0, the cube explodes, doing 10d6
points of damage to all creatures within 10
feet, half that amount to all others within 30
feet, and causing structural damage equal to
twice that caused by a horn of blasting. Crea-
tures who make their saving throw vs. magic
at -4 take half damage. The cube can be
thrown, by hand or with a sling, but will not
explode prematurely no matter what happens.
This Pandora’ box releases 4d4 hostile mon-
sters, all of which attack the one who released
them (including the pouch owner) when the
red spot is pressed. The monsters’ Hit Dice are
selected at random by rolling 1d6, the result
being the level of the monster, but on a result
of 6, roll again using 1d8.

When the red spot is pushed, all nonhostile
creatures within 60 feet must save vs. magic at
-4 or flee in panic for 3d4 rounds. This
includes the box holder as well.

Table L: Wands (Roll 1d8)
A wand of magic missiles with 1d4+10

~ Zagyg’s Spell Component Pouch .-

Any one of the following wands, with 1d4+1
charges (Roll 1d8):
: Wand of frost

: Wand of fire
: Wand of lightning
: Wand of fear

: Wand of illumination

: Wand of polymorphing

: Wand of conjuration

8: Wand of paralyzation

One of three types of wands with 11-14
charges (Roll 1d6):

1-2: Wand of magic detection

3-4: Wand of enemy detection

5-6: Wand of secret door & trap location

A wand that emits a gust of wind, as the spell,
at a cost of one charge. It has 2d4 charges.

A wand like one of those in (4) above, except
that it acts as a rod of cancellation when its
last charge is expended, affecting all magic
items within a 5-foot radius.

A wand that detects life (the life force) of any
creature within 30 feet, including hidden or
invisible creatures, for one turn at a cost of one
charge. It has 2d4 charges. It cannot detect the
life force of creatures smaller than a mouse.
This item, Zadron's wand, has 1d4+10 charges,
and performs as follows: (wielder’s choice) for
the appropriate expenditure in charges: wall of
force, as the spell, for one charge; mirror wall
(described below), for one charge; disintegrate,
as the spell, for two charges; and prismatic spray,
as the spell, for three charges. A mirror wall has
the same effect as the wall of force spell, but crea-
tures may freely pass through the wall, and only
creatures on the same side of the wall as the
spellcaster (wand wielder) can see it. Creatures
on the other side, which is a mirror, see them-
selves. Magic cannot pass in either direction.

Balance Scale
A balance is an instrument used to determine mass
and weight. The nonmagical version uses a beam
and counterweights to find the exact weight of
goods. Magical versions, however, are often used to
create a balance, to establish an impartial verdict,
or to create value where, perhaps, it didn’t exist.

of Conversion
**XP Value:** 5,000 **GP Value:** 25,000
The Book of Marvelous Magic

A weighing device, the balance of conversion, on
command, converts any coins placed in its left-
hand tray into a gem of equivalent value. The gem
appears in its right-hand tray as the coins disap-
pear. It can hold up to 1,000 coins at once, if they
are in sacks. If a second command word is used,
the balance operates in reverse, converting gems
placed in its right-hand tray into any designated
type of coins in the left-hand tray. The coins do
not appear in a container and will spill. This item
functions as often as desired.

of Harmony
**XP Value:** 4,000 **GP Value:** 20,000
The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan
The balance of harmony is a set of scales that can
detect good or evil. A priest places a coin or a
gem with a b/ess spell cast upon it in the right pan
and touches the left pan to the item or person
being tested. Coins or gems of greater value have
a higher chance of detecting correctly. The scales
will balance if they detect good, good outweighs

The Book of Marvelous Magic
This metal weighing device can reveal align-
ments. When any creature touches the right-hand
tray, a coin appears on the left. If the being is
chaotic in nature, a copper piece appears; if law-
ful in nature, an electrum piece appears. The coin
disappears after one round. The scale may be
used three times a day.

of Power
**XP Value:** 6,000 **GP Value:** 30,000
The Book of Marvelous Magic

When a gem of at least 1,000 gp value is placed
on the right-hand tray, this device destroys the
gem and raises any one of the user’s ability scores
to 18. The score raised is selected randomly
unless the user announces one beforehand. The
score returns to normal in 24 hours. The scale
functions once a day.

Ball
Most magical balls are similar to crystal balls and
measure from | to 5 feet in diameter. The balls may
be clear, opaque, or of one or more colors. Most are
crystal or glass, but stone, wood, and other materi-
als have been used to create magical balls.

Avian Attraction
**XP Value:** 50 **GP Value:** 250
DRAGON Magazine 73
A dull, gray stone ball the size of a child’s mar-

ble. When placed in open air (as opposed to a

bag, pocket, or other closed container), the stone
attracts all unintelligent avians that pass within
50 feet. Each avian will approach the ball and
stay within 5 feet for five minutes, unless fright-
ened away, as (for instance) by the obvious pres-
ence of unfamiliar humans. (This item is used by
the wealthy to enhance bird feeders, rock gar-
dens, and reflecting pools.)

Base

**XP Value:** 1,800 **GP Value:** 9,000
The Book of Marvelous Magic
When set upon the ground as the command word
is spoken, this ball attunes itself to that “base.”
After that, if the creature carrying the ball speaks
a second command word, the ball re/eports itself,
the user, and all carried equipment to the base
location. No other creature can be carried or oth-
erwise transported in this way. Standard chances
for error apply (as given in the te/eport spell
description), and the base is treated as “generally
known.” The base ball functions once a week—at
most.

Bowling
**XP Value:** 1,800 **GP Value:** 9,000
DRAGON Magazine 72

This is a +3 weapon that can knock over any
opponent weighing 500 pounds or less that it hits.
On a natural roll of 19 (mystically known as a
“split’’), up to two other similar opponents behind
the one struck are also bowled over. On a natural
20, up to four similar opponents are similarly
affected if the jock yells out the magic word
“Strike!” when releasing the ball.

Cosmetology
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 5,000
DRAGON Magazine 73

A glass ball (several colors possible) about 2
inches in diameter. When someone breaks the
ball, places his or her face and upper body in the
resulting colored smoke, and thinks about the
kind of cosmetic treatment desired—it is instantly
accomplished. One person per ball, cosmetic
effect only (not an actual disguise). Generally
found in lots of 3d6. Different colors may signify
different capabilities.

~ Elemental Ball o

Cue
**XP Value:** 1,200 **GP Value:** 6,000
The Book of Marvelous Magic

This ball looks exactly like a crystal ball, but no
images appear in it, and it may look useless. If
carried, however, it can offer advice. Whenever
the user is in doubt as to a decision of any kind,
the cue ball speaks in a language known to the
user, offering its opinion as to the best course of
action, The cue bail always has an opinion if
asked for advice, though its opinion is entirely
random if a random choice is the only one pos-
sible (such as the direction to take at an unex-
plored intersection). This ball operates by using
ESP on the mind of its user, brilliantly analyzing
and applying all the user’s knowledge to arrive at
its opinion. The cue ball can offer only three
opinions per day.

Elemental
**XP Value** **GP Value**
Earth: 1,000 5,000
Air: 1,000 5,000
Fire: 1,000 5,000
Water: 1,000 5,000

The Book of Marvelous Magic

There are four types of elemental balls—earth, air,
fire, and water—but they are all identical to crystal
balls. Upon command, an elemental bail turns into
its element (stone for earth). Each holds its shape
while in elemental form and resumes the original
crystal appearance on command.

* An air ball is useful underwater, where it can
supply the user with three hours of breathable
air.

¢ If Strength permits, the earth ball can be used
as a boulder (as if thrown by a giant) but it is
treated as a +1 weapon in all respects; it is
also immune to acid damage.

* A fire ball burns the person holding or touch-
ing it for 1d4 points of damage per round of
contact, though it has no effect if any sort of
fire resistance applies; with a touch it will set
combustible materials afire.

* The water ball is useful in desert areas, for it
cannot evaporate and provides one person
with daily water for up to seven days.

On the Prime Material Plane, if an elemental
ball is offered to an elemental creature as a gift, it
causes that creature to become neutral toward the
donor and is thus useful for preventing attacks

from out-of-control, summoned elementals. The

POLYHEDRON Newszine 23

When this item is placed. on a surface and the
command word is uttered, it follows its owner,
rolling along the surface. When it is picked up, it
automatically displays the exact distance it has
traveled (measured in yards, contrary to its name)
since the command. A second command causes it
to reset, starting again at zero. The foot ball can
measure a total of 20,000 yards (approximately
11 miles) per day, and can display distances accu-
rate to within one-tenth of a yard.

Ten percent of all onyx balls are actually inert,

anyway—for effect.

of Power
**XP Value:** 500 **GP Value:** 800
The Book of Marvelous Magic

This ball is identical to a ball of string, but works
in an entirely different manner. When held while
the command word is spoken, it causes the user to
become very fearsome in appearance, brave,
(morale score 12, if applicable), and as strong as
a hill giant (gaining a +4 bonus to hit and damage
rolls, but not able to throw boulders). In addition,
the bail of power protects the user from dam-
age—the first six points of damage taken each
round are magically removed as if by regenera-
tion, but only negating up to six points taken dur-
ing the same round. The ball’s effects last for two
turns, then the ball shrivels and disappears.

Balloon

A magical balloon is a perfect sphere, usually
transparent but occasionally tinted in a single
color. The sphere may be from anywhere from 2
inches to 50 feet in diameter and is constructed
entirely of magic—no matter of any kind is used.
It cannot be flattened, dented, or otherwise
changed in shape, it cannot be damaged by blunt
weapons, nor by any magical attacks except
magic missile, dispel magic (balloon is treated as
30th level), and disintegrate spells. However, bal-
loons are nearly weightless and can be easily
moved by any force, including blows from blunt
weapons and the effects of many spells. Damage
from sharp or pointed weapons cause most bal-
loons to burst immediately; some, however, are
damaged only by pointed or edged, magical
weapons. If floating freely about, a balloon is
treated as AC 7.

A balloon may be ofa single type or may com-
bine as many as five different types. Any balloon
that contains only air, gas, or fluid appears to be
totally empty until burst (unless described other-
wise), but any solid item inside a balloon can be
easily seen from up to 30 feet away.

Air
**XP Value:** 300 **GP Value:** 650
The Book of Marvelous Magic

Air balloons should not be combined with other
types. If punctured carefully with a reed or tube,
an air balloon releases its pure, clean air slowly.
If taken underwater and tightly held while inhal-
ing through its tube, an air balloon can be suc-
cessfully used in place of a water breathing
spell or potion. An air balloon | foot in diame-
ter can provide enough breathable air for one
hour of underwater travel. A 2-foot-diameter
balloon provides air for four hours, and a 3-foot-
diameter balloon for 16 hours. Once punctured,
however, it continues to release air, despite all
attempts to plug the leak.

Carnivorous

**GP Value:** 200

The Book of Marvelous Magic

This balloon floats toward any living creature that
approaches within 10 feet, It magically moves at
double the movement rate of its victim, but can-
not pass through solids. When close enough, it
attacks, automatically hitting its victim and
inflicting 2d6 points of damage caused by blood
draining. It inflicts 1d6 points of damage each
subsequent round. Furthermore, it does not let go
until either it bursts or the victim is dead.

**XP Value:**

 

of Containment

**XP Value:** 200 **GP Value:** 400
The Book of Marvelous Magic
This balloon contains an item. The item must be
smaller than the balloon’s diameter. Magical
items are often found in balloons of contain-
ment, usually with two or more other balloon
effects for protection. When first created, a bal-
loon can absorb any one item it touches, if small
enough. If freed to seek an item of its own
choosing, the balloon drifts off in a random
direction. While on its search, the balloon’s
touch causes any unlocked nonmagical door to
open, It can sense magical items within a 10-
foot range, and touches each one encountered
until it finds one that can be absorbed. The bal-
loon then envelopes the item without bursting,
despite weight, unless the item is an edged
weapon. The balloon then stops searching and
settles to the floor.

Hot Air
**XP Value:** 4,200 **GP Value:** 10,000
The Book of Marvelous Magic

This item is always found clinging to ceilings—it
is never encountered outdoors. A hot air balloon
is warm, easily sensed as such by infravision, and
rises through cooler air. It stops if it encounters
air warmed to the same temperature or upon con-
tact with a ceiling or other obstruction. The bal-
loon cannot be cooled, even by cold spells. If
encumbered by 50 pounds of weight or less, the
balloon rises.

Poison
**XP Value:** 200 **GP Value:** 400
The Book of Marvelous Magic
When burst, this balloon releases a colorless, poi-
sonous gas in a sphere of 10-foot-radius. Each
victim within range must make a saving throw vs.
poison or die. Its potency can be increased so that
it causes a saving throw penalty of up to -8.

Rust
**XP Value:** 300 **GP Value:** 500
The Book of Marvelous Magic
Touching the surface of this balloon has the same
effect as the touch of a rust monster. Any non-
magical metal item used to touch or puncture the
balloon crumbles to rust; magical weapons may
resist the effect (10% chance per magical plus).
Magical metal items without pluses have a 25%

chance to resist the effect.
Soap
**XP Value:** 100 **GP Value:** 200
The Book of Marvelous Magic

When burst, this balloon releases a spray of acrid,
soapy liquid to a range of 10 feet. Each victim in
range must make a saving throw vs. wands or be
temporarily blinded. This lasts for one turn or
until the eyes are rinsed with water.

of Traveling
**XP Value:** 400 **GP Value:** 600
The Book of Marvelous Magic
This item floats toward any living creature that
approaches within 10 feet; it magically moves at
double the movement rate of its victim. When
close enough, it appears to attack, automatically
hitting and sticking to the victim, but it inflicts no
damage. It cannot be removed except by the com-

mand word to release or by being punctured.

Word Balloon

However, the victim of the balloon may direct it,
if the proper command words are known. The
command to “lift” causes it to rise into the air,
carrying the user, of whatever size, and up to 200
pounds of additional weight. If the 10 other com-
mand words are known, the balloon can be
ordered to descend, stop, or drift toward any of
eight compass points: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, or
NW. The rate of descent or ascent is an invariably
30 feet per round. The rate of drift is 60 feet per
round.

Word
**XP Value:** 400 **GP Value:** 600
The Book of Marvelous Magic

When held, this balloon causes the user to lose
his voice. However, anything the user says
appears as floating letters and words, in proper
order, inside the balloon. The words shrink as
more are spoken, making room for an entire sen-
tence of any length. Once a sentence is com-
pleted, the words immediately disappear. Thus,
silent communication is quite possible. The word
balloon does not interfere with spell casting, but
neither does it display the words uttered. It does,
however, display command words spoken. The
words in the balloon appear in the language (and
alphabet) being spoken. They can be read from
any direction and from anywhere the balloon can
be seen.

Band

Bands are thin, flat strips of metal, leather, or
cloth used to confine or bind something. How-
ever, they also can be used as decorative acces-
sories. Bands have been used as a statement of
rank, designating an individual as a slave or
someone in the service of a powerful individual.
The rich often decorate their bands with gems,
feathers, or needlework.

of the Arachnid
**XP Value:** 3,000 **GP Value:** 30,000
DRAGON Magazine 184
These bands are always found in pairs and are
very similar in appearance to bands of the ser-
pent. The bands are worn wrapped around the
spidery legs of the neogi. Only those of that race
who possess magical ability can make use of
them. The wearer gains the following abilities:
* The wearer receives a +2 bonus on all saving
throws vs. poison. This is cumulative with

other forms of magical protection.

* The wearer is immune to the effects of any
spell or spell-like ability that affects move-
ment (slow, hold, and the like). This power is
always in effect, despite the wishes of the
wearer, A side effect of this ability is that the
wearer can move freely through any web,
magical or otherwise, like an actual spider.

* The wearer may transform into a giant spider.
The wearer gains all of the abilities listed in
the MonsTROUS MANUAL accessory under Spi-
der, Giant. The wearer retains his or her own
hit point total. This transformation lasts a
number of turns equal to the wearer’s experi-
ence level. The wearer can transform once per
day.

These items neither have nor require any
charges. Neogi who possess these rare items will
go to great lengths to keep them. Neogi cannot
wear more than one type of magical band at any
time.

of Bird Restraint

**XP Value:** 100 **GP Value:** 500
DRAGON Magazine 73
This is a very small, flexible strip of metal. When
placed around the leg of a bird, its magic prevents
the bird from getting out of the building it occu-
pies, except if physically carried away by some-
one. The band is too small to fit any bird larger
than a hawk,

of Denial
**XP Value:** 4,000 **GP Value:** 20,000
The Ruins of Undermountain

This black ribbon, which can be worn as a garter,
headband, choker, or ceremonial belt, prevents a
priest or wizard from casting any spells while it is
in contact with his or her skin. It does not end or
prevent existing or operating spells already cast
from functioning, nor does it affect the magic of
items used by the wearer.

It looks like a loop of black silk, no knots or
clasps, but a smooth circle of cloth. The band
adjusts to wherever it is worn, fitting snugly
around the biceps, ankle, waist, or neck. While
worn, it conceals any magical auras on or about
the person, and prevents all detection, enchant-
ment, and charm powers or spells from affecting
the person. In short, though this band is a bane to
spell casters, it does protect its wearer from scry-

ing attempts through crystal balls, magical mir-

rors, and all spells except true seeing.

A band of denial can only be destroyed by
silver edged weapons, which must do at least
four points of damage to cut it and destroy its
magical power. It emerges unscathed from acid
baths, explosions, and magical effects that
destroy the body wearing it. Its properties
affect only living beings, not undead or other-
wise animated, nonliving creatures. It can
freely be removed by the wearer, unless physi-
cal restraints prevent this.

Familiar Protection Enhancement
**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 12,000
POLYHEDRON Newszine 82
This item consists of two pieces, a thin band that
is placed about a familiar’s neck and that auto-
matically adjusts itself to the size of the animal,
and another band that is worn about the finger or
on the ear of the wizard. The bands allow the
familiar to travel away from the wizard a number
of miles equal to the wizard’s level, with no ill
effects befalling the animal or wizard. In addi-
tion, twice a day, the wizard can see through the
familiar’s eyes for 10 minutes. The wizard can
perform no other function while doing this.
Familiars receive the Armor Class of the wizard,

if it is higher than theit own.

Iron Bands of Bilarro
**XP Value:** 750 **GP Value:** 5,000
DUNGEON MasTER Guide
When initially discovered, this very potent item
seems to be merely a rusty, iron sphere. Close
examination reveals that there are bands on the 3-
inch-diameter globe. Magical detection reveals
strong magic of an indeterminate nature.

When the proper command word is spoken,
and the spherical iron device is hurled at an oppo-
nent, the bands expand and tightly constrict the
target creature if a successful, unadjusted attack
roll is made. A single creature of up to frost giant
or fire giant size can be captured thus and held
immobile until the command word is spoken to
bring the bands into globular form again. Any
creature captured in the bands, however, gets the
chance to break (and ruin) the bands with a suc-
cessful bend bars roll. Only one attempt is pos-
sible before the bands are set to be inescapable.

In a DRAGONLANCE Campaign: /ron bands of
Bilarro do not exist on Ansalon.

These are thin bands of pluma worn around the
wrists. They can greatly enhance the strength of
the wearer—to 18/00, 19, or 20. The exact
increase is determined by the Dexterity and Wis-
dom attributes of the artisan; take the lower of the
two scores and add 3. This equals the strength
conveyed by the wristbands.

The strength conveyed is added to the hands
and arms of the character, and thus benefits
crushing and pummeling and well as weapon-
wielding power. It does not allow the casting of
boulders, such as is gained with a girdle of giant
strength.

* The wearer can communicate with any form

Banner

All banners are special to those who fight

beneath them, but some are invested with magi-

cal powers, either by enchantment or by the rev-
erence of countless generations of warriors.

Magica! battle standards characteristically

share certain traits and have particular special

abilities. They are typically 9 to 12 feet long
and weigh between 20 and 80 pounds. Their
other common features are:

* They are tough and unfading, making all
item saving throws with a +3 bonus to the
die roll.

* They are inspiring. Soldiers get a +1 bonus to
all saving throws and +3 bonus to morale
checks while in a unit bearing such a banner
(a “unit” is any organized body of troops from
5 to 100 strong).

* They are hard to steal or capture. Any hostile
soldier who manages to seize such a banner
finds it twice as heavy as it should be and has a
-2 penalty to all saving throws while carrying it.

* Their powers wane and wax, depending
upon whether they are being used for legiti-
mate mass-combat purposes (the DM may
declare the powers of a certain standard will
fade if it has been captured by a group of
adventurers). This effect is the result of the
gods withdrawing their good will from such
a device, the lack of proper battlefield
preparation and blessing, and other causes,
DM’s choice.

Most magical battle standards have specific
attributes beyond the above abilities. Note that
experience point values supersede the previously
given value for standards possessing the follow-
ing special attributes:

Other magical banners appear much like nor-
mal scarfs, narrow blankets, or other strips of
cloth. No runes or written words appear on
them, but it may appear that something like a
written notice is there to certain creatures, as
given in each description. The words seen on
such a banner are always readable if the victim

casa

has greater than animal intelligence; the words
seem to be in the reader’s language and alpha-
bet. A magical banner must be displayed over or
near an entrance of some kind to have any mag-
ical effect. Each magical banner affects the
actions of NPCs and monsters, but usually does
not affect PCs, although their curiosity is often
stimulated.

of Bravery
**XP Value:** 4,500 **GP Value:** 7,500

This banner differs from most others, since it must
be carried toward an enemy or dangerous area to
have magical effect. When seen by any creature of
less than 5 Hit Dice, the banner apparently says,
“Excelsior.” Those NPCs and monsters affected
who are friendly toward the banner carriers will fol-
low the user without regard to personal safety
(morale score of 12), This effect lasts for one turn
at most, and occurs only once per day.

Cursed

**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** 1,200
The Book of Marvelous Magic
This banner appears to be and functions as any
other type of banner. However, after three or
more creatures have been attracted or repelled by
its effect, the banner becomes dangerous to
touch. The victim suffers a -4 penalty to attack,
damage, saving throws, and Armor Class. Once
its curse is cast, it returns to normal, but it
becomes cursed again if three or more creatures
are attracted or repelled by it. The curse is perma-
nent until a remove curse spell is cast on the ban-
ner by a 26th- or higher level caster—this remedy
destroys the banner and removes the effects of the
curse.

Dragon Flag
**XP Value:** 1,000

Heart of the Enemy
This 3-foot-square, black cloth bears the outline
of a dragon. When not in use, it is rolled into a
tube and stored in a special ivory case. When
unfurled and displayed on a spelljamming ship,
usually from the top of a mast, it causes the entire
ship to appear as an immense, three-headed mul-
ticolor dragon, spewing fire and clawing at the
air. The effect is purely il/usionary, and the
dragon flag is commonly used to scare away
predators and pirates. Because the illusion is
entirely visual, without benefit of sound or smell,
sophisticated observers aren’t likely to be fooled
for very long. The effect is subject to all the nor-
mal restrictions of an i//usion, including normal
chances of detection. The dragon flag can be used
for one hour per day. If it is not stored in its ivory
case between uses, it permanently loses its
enchantment.

**XP Value:** 750 #$**GP Value:** 12,000
DraGon Magazine 145

A flag of this type appears (in its neutral state) as
a large rectangular or triangular piece of dull,
light-gray fabric. This magical flag is meant to be
flown over a castle or keep. When it is placed
atop any structure, all creatures viewing a flag of
untrue colors (from any distance, including by
scrying) see it either as a bold crest of a family or
country the viewer deems friendly, or of any other
force the viewer recognizes as benign. Whenever
possible, the flag appears the same to each person
in a group; What is more, if blank gray flags are
flown from a structure with a flag of untrue col-
ors, they also take on the illusory hues and colors

of the magical item.

Any creature with a Wisdom of 14 or higher
receives a saving throw vs. spell (with Wisdom
bonuses) against the flag’s effect. Creatures not
affected by illusions are immune to this item.

Law’s
**XP Value:** 5,000 **GP Value:** 25,000
Tome of Magic
This blazing red standard has the magical ability
to raise the morale of troops when held at the
front of a lawful army. The banner inspires any
soldier in the army who is within a quarter-mile
of the banner and can see the flag. Troops inspired
in this manner receive a +2 modifier to their base
morale according to BATTLESYSTEM rules. In
order for an army to be considered lawful, at least
90% of the troops must be of lawful alignment
and no more than 1% can be chaotic.

If the banner falls, the effects are lost immedi-
ately. If the banner is raised within one turn, the
effect returns. If the banner is not raised within one
turn, the inspired troops become filled with dread,
feeling that the battle has clearly gone against their
cause. The same troops now suffer a -2 morale
penalty for the duration of the battle. The standard
may be raised any number of times, but it only
improves or impairs morale once per day.

In Ravenloft: all the effects of this magical
item can be used on mobs and crowds of vil-
lagers. It is up to the DM to decide if the mob or
crowd is sufficiently lawful. Almost by definition
a mob is a chaotic group. However, if the crowd
of villagers is highly organized, the game master
might rule that it is sufficiently lawful to qualify
for a banner.

Oriental Adventures

This banner is a flag that could be hoisted above a
castle or palace. On it are written red characters
for health, prosperity, and fame. To activate the
banner, it must be affixed to the highest point on
the building or compound it is to protect, and the
name of the building or compound must be
boldly written on the banner, Once in place, the
banner extends a magical field that blocks spells
of 5th level or greater. The field extends to all
buildings and grounds that form a single unit,
identified by the name written on it. Thus, if
placed on the main building of Matsuma Castle,
the field would protect all buildings that form the
castle. However, the area of effect can never be
greater than a 100-yard radius. The banner is only
effective while it is flying in plain view. If it is cut
down or removed, the protection is canceled until
the banner is restored to its proper position.

make an immediate morale check. All subsequent

This bright blue standard is like Law's banner in as
much as it greatly affects the turn of a battle, yet it
is very different. Zen is a strict advocate of peace
and her magical banner’s power reflects this. Zen s

banner makes any enemy within a quarter-mile
feel as though they are unjust and cruel, subtract-
ing two from their base morale, according to Bat-
TLESYSTEM rules. This applies even to the most evil
of armies. Should the banner fall, the effects are
immediately lost. Should it not be raised again
within a turn, enemies are filled with blood-lust
and receive a +2 bonus to base morale.

This is a 2-inch-long set of complete horse barding.
When the user places it on the ground and speaks
the proper command word, it enlarges to full size
and magically creates a war horse within it; hit
points are determined randomly for each use. This
can be done once per day at most. The animal dis-
appears on command, when slain, or if the barding
is removed. When the animal disappears, the bard-
ing returns to its original (empty), miniature state.

This leather horse barding emits only a weak

when this barding is fitted onto a horse, pony, mule,
or donkey, it automatically sizes itself to the mount.
When a command word is spoken, a set of feathery
wings graft themselves onto the mount, granting
the beast flight with a maneuverability class D and
a movement rate of 24. The mount can fly up to six
hours before needing to rest. For each hour of
flight, the mount must rest one hour. If a mount is
forced to fly beyond the six-hour limit, the wings
disappear, and mount and rider fall to the ground.

This magical chain barding always has an orna-

is unusually light, weighing about 45 pounds.
When the command word is spoken, the barding
sizes itself to fit any horse, from a pony toa
heavy war horse. The barding gives the horse a -5
Armor Class against missile attacks and a saving
throw vs. spell against magic missiles. Against
nonmissile attacks, the barding confers an AC of
2. The barding can function indefinitely.

Barrel

A barrel is a cylindrical container constructed of
wooden, slats (staves) and held together by circu-
lar, metal bands (hoops). It has flat, parallel ends,
the base is mounted permanently and the top is
usually removable. Both base and top may be per-
manent if one or more holes are cut in the barrel
and sealed with plugs (bungs). A standard barrel
holds 31.5 gallons of liquid or 196 pounds of
solid material (such as flour or treasure), and
weighs 100 pounds when empty.

After determining the magical properties of the
barrel, roll on the following table to determine

the type.

However, it is simple to disassemble. This device
is most often used by priests during their travels

In areas where water is rancid, fouled water can
be collected in this device and, by means of a
drop of sweet water, be made pure.

When this barrel is examined, the victim look-
ing inside it must make a saving throw vs. spell
or be polymorphed into a white ape. In addition,
regardless of the results of the saving throw, one
white ape appears within the barrel and leaps
out, attacking anyone nearby. Another white ape
appears each turn thereafter, until 100 of the
creatures have been created or until a remove
curse spell is applied. The barrel loses all its
magical powers if moved by hand, but may be
transported by the use of telekinesis (weighing
500 pounds).

Neverending Barrel of Grog
**XP Value:** 900 **GP Value:** 4,500
War Captain’s Companion

Often, the greatest worry spelljammer captains
have is maintaining a healthy supply of clean lig-
uids for the ship’s crew. One way this is accom-
plished is by using a neverending barrel of grog.
Grog, a watered down version of cheap, rot-gut
rum, is not particularly good for the crew, but it
will keep them alive (and not complaining)
almost indefinitely. The barrel has a magical
dweomer, but remains empty until it is tapped.
When tapped, it needs to be set upright and lid-
ded. When the handle of the wooden tap is turned
to either the left or right, a dirty, foul-smelling
fluid gurgles forth, filling the cup (or mouth)
lying beneath the spout.

The barrel will forever pour out grog, without
a daily limitation. (After the fifth glass in an
hour’s time, an imbiber must roll a Constitution
check with each glass or pass out. If the check
fails, the character falls asleep for 2d8 hours, and
cannot be awakened by nonmagical means.)

Neverending Barrel of Salt Pork
**XP Value:** 1,800 **GP Value:** 9,000
War Captain's Companion

Another problem of spelljammer captains is the
safe storage of food on board, especially on the
long journeys between crystal spheres. Food kept
in dark, often damp cargo holds has the unsavory
habit of turning bad and spoiling quickly. There-
fore, other means to preserve food need to be
found. Salting meats and vegetables is a common
practice. This curbs spoilage, but storing the bulk
and the extra weight of the meat and salt is a
problem. The neverending barrel of salt pork
allows the ship’s cook to pull up to 100 pounds of
salted pork each day (feeding about 50 crewmen).
Once the salt is scraped, shaken, and dissolved
away, the meat can be cooked, rendering a safe
(although somewhat salty) meal.

When this item is examined, the victim looking
inside is affected immediately and has no sav-
ing throw. All the victim’s items, worn or car-
ried, immediately disappear. Shoulder straps
then appear across the top of the barrel—the
victim may wear the barrel (treat as AC 4 but
with no dexterity adjustments), if desired, by
removing its bottom. The victim’s possessions
are not destroyed, but are merely sent to the
victim’s home. The barrel vanishes if struck by
sunlight.

of Rolling

**XP Value:** 500 **GP Value:** 1,500
The Book of Marvelous Magic

This barrel is useful both for storage and cargo
transport. Its top is easily closed and locks on
command. When laid on its side and a second
command is given, it rolls away from the user at
the rate of 20 feet per round. It cannot be com-
manded to turn, but a third command stops it. It
may be used as often as desired.

Basin
Basins are shallow, round containers crafted out
of ceramics, pottery, or metal. They are chiefly
used to hold water for washing (hands, feet, oral
hygiene). Enchanted basins generally have magi-
cal waters that perform a specific function.

DRAGON Magazine 145

A basin of the angel is a rare, highly prized item
sculpted of precious metal. A spidery design
composed of thousands of interwoven holy sym-
bols adorns its silver base, while its copper bowl
is smooth and reflective. Each basin of this type
has a particular good alignment (either lawful,
neutral, or chaotic), and each of these basins is
sworn to a particular good-aligned deity.

Within the basin’s bowl stands a tall gold stat-
uette of a movanic deva (sometimes resembling a
servant of the deity to which it is dedicated, with
back arched and arms high). The deva figure
pours water into the basin from a crystal vial held
in its hands. The water appears and drains magi-
cally, the basin is always full.

Any evil being touching a basin of the angel
takes 2d6 points of damage and must save vs.
spell to avoid being teleported three miles in a
random, horizontal direction. The basin does not
affect neutral creatures or characters, but it com-
forts any good-aligned being who views it or
touches it, providing a +1d6 morale bonus based
on exact alignment, piety, and so forth of the
viewer or the toucher.

Water from the basin tastes cool and refreshing to
all good-aligned beings who drink from it. For
drinkers of the same alignment as the basin, it cures
disease and cures light wounds with a single sip,
once per week, per individual. A priest of the basin’s
alignment who follows the basin’s patron deity may
drink of its special waters and gain their benefits as
often as he or she likes (maximum of once per day).
Still, a basin of the angel does not realize its full
potential until a 9th-level priest places it within a
permanent shrine to the proper deity. If the priest
then lives in the best manner of his or her faith
always, never straying from alignment, the follow-
ing latent powers accrue to the device:

* It radiates protection form evil in a 240-

yard—radius.

* It causes all evil characters or creatures who
attempt to enter the temple that houses the
basin to save vs. spell at —] or be affected as
the wizard spell repulsion.

* It endows the shrine with a guardian angel, a
movanic deva of average hit points and abili-

ties. This guardian appears only once, at the
time of the temple’s greatest need (as deter-
mined by the DM).

A basin of the angel is about 5 feet high and 2
feet in diameter, and weighs 180 pounds. It is
very awkward to carry. All water taken from it
becomes nonmagical unless consumed within
three rounds.

of Hidden Dangers

**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** 3,000
DRAGON Magazine 145

This magical item appears to be a basin of the
angel, even to the point of radiating a strong aura
of good. However, any evil creature may handle
this item with impunity, for it is actually a device
built by evil gods. A basin of hidden dangers is
constructed by forces of the Outer Planes directly
opposed to those who have basins of the angel
dedicated to them. Thus, Loki may create a basin
of hidden dangers that appears exactly like a
benevolent basin dedicated to Thor, or Set to a
basin dedicated to Osiris.

A basin of hidden dangers immediately and
permanently defiles any good temple it enters,
simultaneously inflicting the temple’s high priest
with a powerful curse. Unless the defiled temple
is razed, the ground beneath it sown with salt, and
a new temple of at least the same size and value
of the old one is built elsewhere, the cursed high
priest will carry temporary defilement (lasting
10d10 years) to any good temple the unfortunate
priest enters. Furthermore, he or she is unable to
learn any spells above the 3rd level until an
atonement is received. This is such a powerful
curse it may only be removed by the methods pre-
scribed above or by employing a wish.

A basin of hidden dangers may be easily
destroyed and does not “follow” a character in the
manner of some cursed items. Note that the
destruction of the basin does nothing to alleviate
its curse.

Basket of Devouring

under the lip.

All items placed into a basket of devouring
have a 5% chance per turn of disappearing. This
can be helpful when an item or valuable piece of
paper is thrown into the basket before its impor-
tance is revealed. (Unfortunately, it can also
cause some problems when incriminating infor-
mation needs to be destroyed and the basket does-
n’t operate for days.)

(It is rumored that items placed in a basket of
devouring are not destroyed. The rumor has it that
the contents are dimensionally shifted into the
Astral Plane. There, the arcane have a special
asteroid base where they sift through the refuse
looking for valuables. All valuable information
and items are catalogued and placed in a vast
library.) This item does not function while a ship
is in the phlogiston.

Battering Ram

A battering ram is a long, heavy beam of wood
with a thick, sturdy head for smashing down
walls and portals. A ram can be carried by a siege
machine or by a group of six or more warriors.
Simple rams often are constructed from nearby
trees and left at the sight of the siege, but magical
versions can be very ornate and are reusable.

Battering rams can also be attached to the front
of sea-faring or spelljamming ships, These rams
are used to crush the life out of enemy craft.

Bigby’s Demanding

A singular item manufactured by a master wizard
of the City of Greyhawk, this ram is a 10-foot,
brass-sheathed battering ram, forged by dwarves
from the Farthest Mountains, It was bathed in the
boiling blood of a dozen yeti to give it strength,
rune-etched with the acid of a black dragon, then
tempered in a living volcano. Its head was forged
from a single wedge of bronze brought from the
Elemental Plane of Earth and carved in the shape
of a clenched fist by six bound efreet. Finally, it
was invested with Bigby's clenched fist, Bigby's
forceful hand, and wall of iron. The result is a bat-
tering ram that takes 10 men, minimum Strength
13+ or the equivalent, to use. On impact, it deliv-
ers a blow equal to triple the usual structural
damage inflicted by a ram.

Beacon
Beacons are any number of different devices,
but one thing they all have in common is their
ability to attract attention. Beacons may be used
to warn vessels of reef barriers, to signal spell-
jamming ships that a waystation is ahead, or
mark courses.

Arcane beacons are devices used to attract spell-

cally, these beacons are used only in the largest
ports—because they do attract unwelcome visitors.

The beacons are fueled by gold, which they
burn at a rate of one gold piece an hour. This
makes them very expensive to keep running, but
most trading ports believe they are worthwhile
investments, since they keep potential clients
from flying past. Some ships also carry an arcane
beacon in case they are stranded and require res-
cue, but such use is rare.

They resemble squat-legged stoves, with clear,

Thayvian
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 10,000
DUNGEON Magazine 38

A Thayvian beacon is a magical device that attracts
a specific type of monster into an area and then
holds it there through a powerful form of mind con-
trol. These beacons were developed by the School
of Conjuration and Summoning in Thay, originally
for use in Rashemen. Minshak Keseri was an influ-
ential member of the School at this time and was
partly responsible for the item’s invention.

To create a Thayvian beacon, the wizard first
needs to find a piece of the monster to be attracted
(a tooth, for example). Next, a skilled metalsmith
is required to cast a bronze disk 1-foot in diame-
ter and 3 inches thick. The likeness of the mon-
ster should be carved into the mold, so that a
relief picture of the beast appears on the disk. The
piece of the monster must be ground or crushed
into the molten bronze.

When the disk has been removed from the mold
and has cooled, the wizard can begin work. The
exact spells to be cast are known only to select Red
Wizards of the School of Conjuration and Sum-
moning, but Elminster of Shadowdale believes
they include enchant an item, permanency, and
charm monster, as well as monster summoning
spells whose potency level must total the Hit Dice
of the monster to be summoned. In other words, to
enchant a beacon to attract bulettes the wizard

Beady Eye

"csi mneeeiieeieeaeiemeemenemnnl

needs to cast monster summoning VII and monster
summoning II (or a similar combination), since a
bulette is a 9-HD monster.

Each beacon must have its own unique com-
mand words to both activate and deactivate it. Mon-
sters that can be attracted by Thayvian beacons
must be of low intelligence or less. The range of a
device is 10 miles per Hit Die of the monster to be
summoned. Once attracted to the beacon, a power-
ful charm affects the monster. The creature must
make an Intelligence check or it cannot stray far-
ther than 1 mile per Hit Die from the beacon. For
each week within the effect of a beacon, the mon-
ster can check again, adding a cumulative +1 to its
Intelligence check. If it cannot overcome the bea-
con’s influence, the monster remains within the
zone of effect, even if this means it starves to death.

Bead

Magical beads are normally % to 1 inch in diame-
ter, made of any color glass, ceramic, metal, or
other material. Beads are fragile and should not
be thrown; almost any impact will shatter a bead,
destroying it and its magic. When found, 1d4+1
beads are usually together, perhaps on a string,
although they need not be all of the same type.

of Accuracy
**XP Value:** 150 **GP Value:** 1,500
The Book of Marvelous Magic

When this bead is thrown, it automatically hits
any victim within 60 feet, and the victim must
make a saving throw vs. spell. If the saving throw
is successful, the bead falls off but does not break
and can be recovered unless broken afterward.
Otherwise, it sticks to the victim and turns into a
small target ring of concentric circles. The effect
lasts for one hour and cannot be removed except
by soap of washing or a wish. If generally aimed
at the side on which the target appears, all weapon
attacks gain a +2 bonus, attacking the targeted
victim. For example, a thief’s backstab attempt
would not gain this bonus unless the bead was
thrown at the victim’s back.

confused, and then completely stunned until the
bead is destroyed. If crushed while in use (by
someone being spied upon, for example), the user
must make a saving throw vs. spell or be blinded
(curable by the usual methods). Although the user
may have any number of extra eyes with these
beads, the eyes cannot be closed and the user can-
not avoid looking through them. If any monster
with a gaze attack looks at the eye in use, the user
must make the appropriate saving throw (possibly
each round), and may not look away. Upon com-
mand, the eye turns into a bead again.

These small, black spheres might be mistaken for
common beads, marbles, or, perhaps, unusually

in diameter and quite heavy, weighing almost an
ounce. One can be hurled up to 30 feet away. Upon
impact, the bead sends a burst of force that inflicts
5d4 points of damage on all creatures within the
10-foot radius of its burst. Those saving take full
damage, but the force has thrown them back.
Those failing to save vs. spell are immediately
encapsulated after taking damage. The force forms
a sphere around the victims (even those of large
size) and they are unable to escape except by the
same means by which a wall of force is brought
down. The effect dissipates in 3d4 rounds. About

A team of Immortals placed this major artifact
deep beneath the earth, in the ruins of the Nithian

was created at great expense of power by the Old

Immortals who wished to reestablish the balance
disturbed by the direct interference of Thanatos
(and his secret ally Corona) in the affairs of the
Nithian Empire.

STRATEGIC REVIEW Magazine 5

These beads (10d4) are mounted on a string, and
may only be used by priests for aid in prayer. All of
the beads are of gem-quality stone (a minimum of
100 gp each), and of uniform size and value.

Bead of Atonement: Allows a user to have an
80% chance of atoning for a transgression that
has caused an alignment change. In other words,
it gives the user an 80% chance of regaining his
or her original alignment.

Bead of Response: Serves as a hotline to the
patron deity, assuring response to prayers, though
in no way guaranteeing that the response is the
one hoped for—gods are fickle.

Bead of Damnation: Serves as a hotline to the
patron’s chief nemesis, which usually gets the
user in trouble.

Bead of Karma: For priests of the 1st to the 5th
levels, it increases their powers by three levels for
3d4 turns; 6th through 10th, two levels for 2d4
turns; and 11th level+, one level for 1d4 turns.

Bead of Succor: Increases the base chance of
response from the god prayed to by 30%.

Bead of Hindrance: Decreases chance of a
response by 30%.

This valuable item allows a priest to exchange one
known spell (not yet cast) for another, if both are
of the same spell level. For example, if the priest
knows detect magic but needs cure light wounds,
the priest may use the bead to forget detect magic
and gain knowledge of cure light wounds. The new
spell may be cast when needed. The priest need not
be fully rested to use the bead. After changing one
spell, the bead disintegrates.

**XP Value:** 1,500 **GP Value:** 12,500
DuNGEON Master Guide

This container resembles a jug or flask. It isa
magical beaker with alchemical properties allow-
ing it to create 1d4+1 doses of 1d4+1 potions.
(The kinds of potions are determined by random
selection.) Different potions are layered in the
container, and each pouring takes one round and
results in one dose of one potion.

Roll 1d4+1, to find the number of potions the
beaker holds. Roll again to find which potions
the beaker contains (delusion and poison are pos-
sible). Record each potion in order of occur-
rence—the potions are layered and are poured in
order. Duplication is possible.

If the container holds only two potions, it dis-
penses them one each per day, three times per
week; if three are contained, one each per day,
twice per week. If four or five are contained, one
per week is produced. Once opened, the beaker
gradually loses the ability to produce potions. The
reduction in ability results in the permanent loss of
one potion type per month, determined randomly.

When these beans are thrown against a solid sur-

The beans are generally carried in metal con-

tainers. A character who falls with a bean in his

ity check is applicable), If a container holding a
bean misses a saving throw vs. crushing blow or
falling, the bean activates.

PCs who eat beans discover that these beans
taste horrible. If a PC spits it out before swallow-
ing, there is no ill effect. Ifa PC swallows a bean,
he or she must roll a saving throw vs. poison for
each bean swallowed. A successful saving throw
has the following effects:

An ingested ooze, slime, and jelly bean causes a
character to suffer flu-like symptoms for 2d4 days
as the bean activates, the resulting lifeform dies, and
the body attempts to purge it. Symptoms include
extreme nausea and vomiting, distended stomach,
diarrhea, and body aches. Such a character could be
transported in a wagon, but would not be strong
enough to ride a horse. The character suffers a -4
penalty to all attack rolls and Strength and Constitu-
tion scores are reduced by 3 points for the duration
of the illness. Effects are cumulative with each bean
swallowed, and if any attribute drops to 0, the char-
acter dies. A cure disease spell administered any
time during the illness removes all effects.

Beholder Mouthpick

**XP Value** **GP Value**
Fangpick: 3,000 6,000

The Ruins of Undermountain
For all their formidable might, the eye tyrants can-
not accomplish the simple task of picking up a
stick without some aid. To circumvent their lack of
appendages and limbs, beholders sometimes use
mouthpicks or tongue-arms to manipulate items.

"Nh cteniieneneeenetteneieneneeinndentenneenenneiieenenmemaa

 

These are nothing more than reaching aids, often
articulated and of metal, held in an eye tyrant’s
mouth. They are manipulated with lips, tongue,
and teeth (in a manner akin to a human pipe
smoker moving a pipe around in his or her mouth)
to move, trigger, or carry items that the beholder
would rather not carry in its mouth to spit out later.

Mouthpicks may be improvised from wooden
masts, tree-trunks, or spars in a pinch, but behold-
ers prefer to use more sophisticated specimens,
generally made of metal, which may end in
spikes (1d6 points of damage), scraping or cup-
ping flanges, shovel-bowls, or pincer-like arms
(one point of piercing damage to any creature
gripped). Numerous beholder mouthpicks have
many-branched ends incorporating all of these
control devices and more.

Mouthpicks save against attack forms according
to the material of their construction. Severing one
or shattering a grasping attachment usually requires
characters to inflict at least 12 points of damage.

Beholders set such mouthpicks between their
teeth, and can withdraw lip and tongue pressure
in an instant—so an attack that rams a mouthpick
back into a beholder’s mouth only does 1d6
points of damage, as the mouthpick strikes the
bony interior plates that protect the inner organs

of every beholder.

%
Several types of magical mouthpicks have been
reported. One, known to still exist in Undermoun-
tain, is described here. A fangpick of electrum-
plated stainless steel. Worth about 20 gp for its
metal content, this 12 foot-long shaft ends in a rake-
or scythe-shaped arc of metal, set with many long,
curved metal teeth. This metal arc grazes opponents
for 1d4 points of damage; if an attack roll is 19 or
20, the pick automatically closes its arc in a “bite,”
allowing the toothed scythe to wrap around the vic-
tim to inflict 1d12 points of damage and hold him or
her immobile for a round, These actions are mechan-
ical, operating for any wielder of the item.

Grooves in the base of the pick contain tiny con-
tacts akin to the buttons on a rod of lordly might. If
manipulated by the tongue or fingers of a skilled user,
these contacts activate the pick’s power (maximum of
three times per day) to paralyze any being struck. A
normal saving throw vs. paralyzation is allowed; if
failed, onset time is 1d2 rounds after being struck,
and the paralysis lasts for 1d4 turns. (This magical
effect is besides physical tooth damage).

A fangpick will levitate whenever released by a
being, to hang motionless in midair until next
grasped or disturbed. Some of these items auto-
matically absorb electrical energy (such as light-
ning bolts) into themselves, sparing anyone
touching a pick from any damage.

The name of the inventor of the mouthpick of
absorption is lost to the ages; presumably, its
invention has limited use for normal beholders, as
their antimagic ray negates any magical functions
of the item. Any magical beholder mouthpicks
can only be fully used by those beholder-kin that
do not radiate an antimagic field.

Bellows

Bellows are made of wood, leather, and metal. Two
rounded wooden boards, each carved with a han-
dle at one end and tapering to a 3-inch tip at the
other, are attached to the sides of a leather bag; a
metal tube covers the tips and is connected to the
bag. When the handles are pressed toward one
another, air is forced from the bag through the tip.

This bellows looks like and is used as a bellows
of breath, However, when pumped and com-
manded, it produces great winds. The winds blow
all loose items about, effecting a cone 60 feet
long and 10 feet wide at its furthest point. Each
victim within the area must make a saving throw
vs. spell or be knocked over and unable to attack
or cast spells. If used to help propel a boat with
sails, the winds add a bonus of 30 feet per round
to the movement rate. The bellows may be used
once per day for up to a full turn per use.

of Roaring
**XP Value:** 1,500 **GP Value:** 7,500
The Book of Marvelous Magic

This bellows appear to be and function as a bellows
of breath—it also produces a cloud of green gas.
The cloud is harmless. However, if any victims
within it are hostile to the user, they all roar in rage
for one round. Their roars bestow a +1 bonus on
their attack rolls and saving throws for one turn and
attract the attention of all other creatures within 120
feet. Only one cloud can be created each day.

Belt

Belts are accessories worn about the waist. Pouches,
scabbards, and other objects can be suspended from
a belt, allowing the wearer easy access to the con-
tents. Belts also are used hold up dungarees, pants,
and hose that are too large. Magical belts can hold
almost any type of enchantment, and their use is as
varied as those of magical rings or staves.

in space wrecks and treasure caches.
By turning a stud on the belt, a wearer who
knows its secrets can /evitate to any height. This
allows the wearer to rise or descend through the air

tation on the number of times this power can be acti-
vated, but turning it on or off requires one round.
The belt can also shed magical light or darkness ina
20-foot radius around the wearer. Identical to the
effects of the wizard spells, these effects affect the
belt wearer as well, lasting up to six rounds at a time
(though the wearer can terminate them sooner).
Once either of the belt powers is used, the belt
cannot repeat that particular effect until a com-
plete turn has elapsed. The belt may be removed
without ceasing to function (the wearer may cre-
ate darkness, slip off the belt, and leave it to creep
blindly toward a known exit to make an escape).

The belt has one additional power. By proper
manipulation of the studs, the wearer can raise a wall
of force twice a day, lasting for up to four turns (or
ending instantly or earlier, if the wearer so desires).
The wail of force covers an area equal to that of the
equivalent spell, cast by a 16th-level wizard.

The belt’s studs all lock into place and cannot
accidentally be manipulated by a casual swipe or
jostle. The belt appears to be leather with a metal
boss, but it saves against dangers as if it were
entirely metal, gaining a +3 bonus as well.

, The Atruagin Clans

The Children of the Elk fashion cylindrical beads
from the shells of various freshwater mollusks and
bivalves. These are known as wampum and are
often traded or used in a manner similar to that of
money in the outside world. While the Elk Clans
do use them as a means of exchange, they gener-
ally prefer to think of the shells as a raw material
from which jewelry can be made. In fact, the vari-
ous colors of wampum are important for their role
in the creation of wampari or shell belts.

Wampari are created under the guidance of
shamani and come in several colors, each of
which has a special purpose. The actual creation
of a wampari requires one month of labor, while
its enchantment is completed in but a single
night. When the belt is assembled, it is brought
and given into the care of a shamani.

The shamani calls upon the person for whom the

"ine

belt was made and, using a sharp knife, makes sev-
eral cuts in the owner’s chest. The symbols that the
shamani makes are always related to the totem
spirit of both the person who made the belt and the
person who will wear it—this symbolizes the bond
between the two. After the cuts are made, the
wounds are packed with various colored herbs and
several magical spells are woven. When all is done,
the belt is enchanted. All wampari have good
effects upon those they were made for, but anyone
else who tries to wear one will be cursed. Once put
on, a cursed wampari cannot be removed without
the aid of a dispel magic spell.

Black Belts: Black wampari attest to the health
and vigor of the wearer. Thus, their owners gain a
+1 bonus to Constitution (up to a maximum of 18)
while the belt is in place. If the belt is donned by
another, a-1 Constitution penalty is imposed.

Blue Belts: Wampari of this type are symbols
of the understanding found in a truly wise person.
They grant a +1 bonus to their wearer’s Wisdom
score (up to a maximum of 18) while in place and
a similar penalty to anyone else.

Golden Belts: It is possible to fashion
wampum that have a golden tint. When such
beads are made into belts and enchanted by
shamani, they increase the Charisma of their
owner by +1 point (up to a maximum of 18).
Others wearers suffer a -1 point penalty.

Green Belts: Green wampari are symbols of
sure-footedness and agility. They bestow upon
their rightful owners a +1 bonus to Dexterity (up
to a maximum of 18) while being worn and upon
other wearers a like penalty.

Red Belts: Wampari fashioned from red beads
are symbols of might and power. They are nor-
mally given to warriors and have the effect of
increasing the wearer’s Strength by +1 point (up
to a maximum of 18) when worn. If someone
other than the belt’s owner puts on the wampari,
the thief loses -1 point of Strength.

White Belts: Wampari set with white beads
are symbols of open-mindedness and clear think-
ing. They impart a +1 bonus to their owner’s
Intelligence score (up to a maximum of 18) and a
like penalty if worn by another.

Shadow
**XP Value:** **GP Value:** —
Five Coins for a Kingdom

Created by the fiend ruler Orcus, the shadow belt
is known in the legends of a hundred planes of
existence—though thankfully not on the Prime
Material Plane. Orcus has subtly engineered its
frequent disappearances and rediscoveries, partly
as a way to test likely candidates for Immortality
in the Sphere of Entropy.

Durhan is the latest candidate; he has already
failed his test. Durhan lacks the self-awareness
necessary for Immortals. His invasion of Trann
endangered the entire realm of Eloysia. Even if
he is aware of this, he cares not—Durhan is
crazed with a lust for power.

A simple leather belt with an iron buckle, it has
a gray, leather strap that fits over one shoulder
and crosses the chest like a baldric. The belt
changes size to fit any wearer.

Carved on the belt and strap are disc-shaped
symbols. When the wearer touches a symbol and
concentrates, a gold skullcap appears, attached to
the belt by an infinitely extendable gold wire. The
belt can produce up to 500 of these caps, which
are used for its power drain ability.

Suggested Powers

* Lightning bolt

* Mass charm

* Power drain (see below)
* Clairvoyance

¢ Levitate

* Immunity

_ The shadow belt is activated when a user puts
it on. The belt extends countless, hair-thin fila-
ments that grow through clothing or leather
armor and into the wearer’s skin—literally meld-
ing to the host’s body. The filaments cannot grow
through metal armor, and the belt does not acti-
vate until the filaments have grown into the host’s
body. Thereafter, the belt can’t be removed until
the host dies or reaches Immortality.

Knowledge of the belt’s powers is acquired

when the belt is activated. Each power is trig-
512

 

169

hg
gered by mental command alone and does not
require continued concentration.

The power drain ability is unique to the shadow
belt. Unlike most artifacts, it does not regenerate
power itself. Instead, it leeches power from other
beings or its host to regain power. A victim must
be willing or charmed, and a gold cap and wire
from the belt must touch the victim’s body.

The belt regains one spell level per day for
each level of the victim. (Normal people count as
lst level for this purpose.) A victim is drained of
vitality while wearing the cap and can take no
action. The helpless victim may suffer from lack
of food or sleep while being drained, but is other-
wise unharmed once the cap is removed.

Suggested Handicaps: When first used, align-
ment changes to a chaotic bent. After that, the
wearer grows 1d4 inches a day. Maximum height
is three times normal, and the body becomes hor-
ribly distorted at large sizes. No damage (except
unceasing agony) while belt is worn; when

removed, the victim shrinks to normal size, tak-

ing 1d6 damage per foot shrunk.

Suggested Penalty: While any power is used, a
heavy storm arises, centered on the user and con-
tinues while the power effect lasts,

Durhan, the current user of the shadow belt, is
wired into 500 wizards of 1st to 21st level. These
wizards have been kidnapped from all over
Eloysia. Their energy gives Durhan an effectively
infinite amount of power to spend,

While wearing the shadow belt, Durhan is immune
to all 1st- through 4th-level spells, charms, mental
control, and poison, and to all spells that cause
instant destruction. Durhan was a 36th-level wizard
before donning the shadow belt; with it, he can cast
any and all wizard spells at any level, repeatedly and
without limitation. The sole exception are wish
spells, which were intentionally placed beyond the
power of the shadow belt by Orcus. (Druid and
priestal spells cannot be cast with this artifact).

Nonattack spells can be amplified in effect by
the belt. For example, a vastly increased fele-
kinesis spell allowed Durhan to remove Solius
from Trann. Other possible effects are as follows:
* Walls of stone, ice, fire, or iron can be con-

structed of indefinite size.

* Polmorphing large numbers of objects at once
is possible (for instance, meteors of a meteor
swarm Cast against Durhan can be altered).

* Monsters of 20+ HD can be created via a cre-
ate monster spell.

~~», Snake Belt -

These amplified spells cannot directly affect
an enemy. Attack spells have their usual effects.
For example, a fireball from the shadow belt
never does more than 20d6 hp damage.

The unpleasant side effects of wearing this
artifact are obvious—Durhan’s huge, distended
form is clearly painful.

even up stone or wooden walls, at speeds up to 6
per round. The belt relays a visual impression of
all it passes to its owner, akin to a wizard’s eye
spell. It causes 1d4 points of damage to any crea-
ture it strikes (biting as a 3 HD monster with 18
hp). The snake belt is considered to have 18/00
Strength for purposes of strangling victims, pin-
ing arms, or forcing a door open or closed.

commanding his monkey to climb into the saddle.
To Udo’s wonder and delight, he sprouted wings
and made his escape. Now, the wizard has taken
the silver buckle from the saddle and sewn it onto
a belt. He still requires a small rider on his shoul-
der to make the belt function, but he’s been used
to having a monkey on his back for a long time.

Zoster of Zoophobia
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** 1,800
The Book of Marvelous Magic

This belt appears and functions as a zoster of
zeal. However, when commanded to function, it
also inflicts the user with a morbid and uncon-
trollable fear of animals of all types (no saving
throw). In addition, the victim must make a sav-
ing throw vs. spell. If the throw fails, the wearer
is overcome by a strange illusion—that all those
nearby are turning into animals. The victim flees
and hides from the animals if possible; the illu-
sion passes when the zoster’s effect ends after one
turn. The phobia does not end, however, and the
victim flees from any normal or giant-sized ani-
mal seen thereafter, running at three times normal
movement rate for at least six rounds. The phobia
can be cured by a remove curse applied by a
caster of 15th level or higher, or by a heal spell.
The phobia returns each time the zoster is acti-
vated: it cannot be removed from the item.

of Ramming
**XP Value:** 1,500 **GP Value:** 7,500
The Book of Marvelous Magic

This wooden bench is 4 feet long, 2 feet wide, 3
feet high, and seats two human-sized creatures. It
weighs 50 pounds and may be carried by one
(using both hands) or two (using one hand each), If
used to ram a door, the ramming is probably suc-
cessful. Unsecured doors may be opened easily;
locked doors open 90% of the time, although this
will trigger most unremoved traps (if any). Wizard
locked doors may be rammed open 50% of the
time, and one-way doors 25% of the time from the
wrong side, although this usually destroys the door.
The bench has no effect on barred doors. It may be
used as often as desired, but each use has a 5%
chance (not cumulative) of destroying its magic.

Berry
Berries, like apples and other fruit, have found
many magical uses, The entries below depict only
a small portion of these. (See Potion for the uses
of magical berries in a DARK SUN Campaign.)

Fireberries

**GP Value:** 1,200

Similar to fireseeds, these are nature’s own vari-
ety. To activate a berry, it must be thrown onto the
ground and a command word spoken. This causes
the berry to burst into flames that inflict 1d8
points of damage and ignite any combustibles
they touch. They may be thrown up to 10 feet.

Many years ago, an old priest spilled a potion of

berries themselves have healing properties.
Twelve berries are on each bush, and each berry
acts as a half-strength potion of healing, curing

berries spoil fairly quickly though, and are only

Bison Skull Totem

**XP Value:** 5,000 **GP Value:** 50,000

DUNGEON Magazine 32
These permanent, magical items are usable by any
Rover shaman. A bison skull totem focuses the mag-
ical ability of a shaman when either held in a
shaman’s hands or placed on top of a totem pole.
When on a totem pole, the skull gives the following
powers to all villagers within 500 yards—cannot be
surprised by attackers, +1 on saving throws, and
protection from evil (as the spell). In a shaman’s
hands, the skull gives the following additional bene-
fits—+2 on saving throws to shaman holding it,
protection from evil 10' radius, immunity to fear,
and protection from normal missiles.

A bison skull totem has several greater powers,
usable once per day. To invoke these, a shaman must
hold the skull overhead and chant a command
phrase. The powers are—a blast of fear (as a wand
of fear), flame strike, insect plague, and sunray. If
the skull is threatened with capture by a non-Rover,
it can teleport itself to the nearest Rover shaman.

Kolkis’s Evil Skull Totem is a twisted parody
of a normal Rover bison skull totem. It can dis-
guise itself to appear as a normal bison skull. For
its powers to be manifested, it must be wielded in
the same way as a Rover shaman uses a good
totem. Although it no longer has the power to
change alignment, it still grants other powers to
its user-—immunity to fear, +2 on saving throws;
inability to be surprised, and protection from nor-
mal missiles. The following powers can be used
once per day: insect plague, confusion, flame
strike, slow, fear, and sticks to snakes. Kolkis’s
evil skull totem has no powers when placed on a
totem pole, unlike a true bison skull totem. Any
good-aligned person who touches this evil stench-
kow skull takes 2d4 hp electrical damage.

Black Wall
**XP Value:** 4,000 **GP Value:** 20,000
DRAGON Magic
This wall is made of pure obsidian. There is a solid
black circle about 50 feet in diameter in front of the
wall. Dragons believe that specific aromas can trig-
ger vivid memories. By touching areas of the black

""l pineinnnnRiER nel

wail in certain sequences, aromas are produced that
enable a dragon, or any other intelligent creature, to
experience racial memories of incidents occurring
thousands of years before birth. If anyone touches
the wall and stands in the circle, he or she feels a
tingling sensation in the body and then smells a
strong aroma that seems to flow from the wall and
envelop his or her head. The intense effect lasts
only a few seconds. Roll 1d6 and consult the fol-
lowing table for the aroma and the effect.

Roll Result

1 Sea Water

2 Decay

3 Violets

4 Baking Bread
5-6 No Effect

¢ Sea Water: This aroma is of sweet, salty air
blowing in on an ocean breeze, triggering
vague memories of living in the sea—play-
fully chasing fish, exploring the murky depths,
breaking through the surface to catch the sun’s
rays. (The implication is that the one touching
has evolved from some sort of marine life.)
This experience is so soothing that the PC
recovers 1d2 hp of damage.

* Decay: The stench of rotting meat triggers
vague memories of living in a dark swamp—
scraping in the mud for scraps to eat, hiding in
cool caves from predators, shaking from fever
chills. (The implication is that the one touch-
ing has evolved from some sort of primitive
swamp-dweller). This experience is so dis-
turbing that the toucher must succeed in a
Constitution Check or lose one hp of damage.

¢ Violets: The fragrance of sweet violets triggers
vague memories of floating in a void—formless
wisps of color, distant echoed voices, flashes of
soft light. (The implication is that the spirit of
the one touching had an existence that predated
his or her physical body.) This experience is so
profound that the toucher is distracted for the
next hour, making all attack rolls at -1.

* Baking Bread: This is the delicious aroma of
freshly baked bread, triggering vague memo-
ries of infancy—snuggling against a warm
body, hearing gentle melodies from a soft
voice, watching a colorful butterfly float by in
the breeze. This experience is so relaxing that
the one touching immediately falls asleep (no
saving throw allowed) and stays asleep until

something or someone wakes the character.

Blanket

Blankets are extremely common items that can be
found in almost every climate and culture. They
are used primarily for warmth or comfort, espe-
cially during sleep. However, they also are used
for decorative or ritualistic purposes. Many
northern cultures use many layers of blankets or
hides as their only form of clothing.

of Comfort

**XP Value:** 600 **GP Value:** 1,600
DRAGON Magazine 73

This blanket automatically maintains a comfort-

able temperature for anyone sleeping under it. It

cannot maintain a temperature difference of more

than 30 degrees, however, from the ambient

atmosphere.

of Devouring

**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** 1,200
The Book of Marvelous Magic

This plain gray blanket is 6 feet square. When it
is used to wrap or cover any living creature,
dozens of tiny mouths appear inside the blanket
and bite the victim for 10 points of damage per
round. Once the mouths appear, a remove curse is
needed to remove the blanket. Once removed, the
blanket becomes nonmagical and powerless.

of Protection
**XP Value:** 3,000 **GP Value:** 15,000
The Book of Marvelous Magic
This plain, gray blanket is 6 feet square. Its user
can rest easily, for it blocks all magical and nor-
mal attacks as long as the user is asleep. It has no
power while the user is awake. A wish spell is
needed to remove the blanket without the user’s

permission.

Silk Coverlet of Warmth
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 7,500
POLYHEDRON Newszine 43

Although it appears as only a finely woven bed-
covering of dazzling color, this coverlet is capa-
ble of maintaining a comfortable temperature for
sleeping—even in the most extreme conditions of
cold and wind. It is always large enough to spread
over three human-sized individuals. It does not
work if it is wrapped around a person. It must be
spread out over someone on a horizontal surface.

of Sleeping
**XP Value:** 900 **GP Value:** 1,800
The Book of Marvelous Magic

This plain gray blanket is 6 feet square. If used to
wrap or cover any living creature, the victim must
make a saving throw vs. spell or sleep until the
blanket is removed. The blanket is easily removed
by anyone except the victim, If the saving throw
is successful, the blanket has no effect. The vic-
tim needs no food or water while asleep, and may
sleep for years. A normal attack roll is required if
the blanket is used in hand-to-hand combat.

The Book of Wondrous Inventions

Blashphor was a kindly and studious wizard who
lived with his wife, Atrina, in the tiny village of
Spinyon, a poor farming community many miles
from the nearest trade route. Blashphor eventu-
ally left Spinyon for a wilderness retreat where he
could do his research without interruption.
Atrina, pregnant with their first child, was less
than eager to go, but Blashphor convinced her
that he needed her help. Besides, he argued, there
could be no better way for their child to come
into the world than surrounded by the magnifi-
cent splendor of nature. Reluctantly, Atrina
agreed,

Six months later, in a small cabin deep in a
beautiful remote woodland, Atrina gave birth to
triplets. Sadly, Atrina died in childbirth, leaving
Blashphor alone with his three new sons. The
grieving Blashphor chose to return to the village
and continue his research, while raising his sons
as best he could, However, Blashphor’s research
went very slowly, and caring for three infants
proved all but overwhelming. Able to transmute
only the simplest of gases and minerals, he devel-
oped diapers as an experimental novelty that kept
his babies dry and clean—a great help to an over-
burdened father, but hardly the breakthrough he
desired.

Believing himself a failure, Blashphor was sur-
prised when new parents in the village took an
interest in his magical diapers. Intrigued, he
began to tinker with another of his seemingly

minor magical experiments and soon came up
with a baby cradle that completely provided for
an infant’s needs. The cradles were made avail-
able at harvest time, much to the delight of the
overworked parents.

The diaper resembles an ordinary white diaper,
but the cloth is somewhat softer and silkier and
sparkles slightly in the sunlight. Small leather
straps in the corners serve as fasteners. The cra-
dle is a rectangular box made of polished wood,
typically oak or maple. Colorful caricatures of
animals and babies are painted on the sides, and
two wooden rockers are attached to the bottom. A
small platform extends from the foot of the cradle
and holds a medium-sized flowerpot containing
sweet-smelling mint plants. Daisies, violets, and
other flowers grow in boxes attached to the sides
of the cradle.

A long wooden rod extends upward from the
flowerpot at the foot of the cradle, and a second
rod crosses it at the top to make a perch. A
brightly feathered parrot sits on the perch, softly
chattering and chirping as it overlooks the cradle.
At the end of the perch is a wooden tube contain-
ing food for the parrot. A small cup at the base of
the tube is filled with seeds.

Another wooden rod is attached to the head-
board. Two objects are attached to this rod and
hang over the cradle. One is a large, leathery bag
ending in a long tube. The other is a delicately
balanced mobile made of several pieces of bam-
boo and crystal. The mobile produces a soothing
tinkle at the slightest touch. A string extends from
the mobile to the parrot’s food tube.

Construction: Blashphor was responsible for
the magical diaper and the crib of pushing. Each
has its own construction requirements. Because
of the time and expense involved, it is a good idea
to create a large number of diapers of enchant-
ment at the same time. Using this method, up to
15 yards of cloth can be enchanted at the same
time (12,000 gp, 39 days), enough to make as
many as 30 small to medium-sized diapers. A
newly woven bolt of cloth made from any natural
fiber interwoven with 10% butterfly silk must
first be hung outside and blown in the wind for
30 days. A permanent transmute foul to fresh
spell (2nd level) is then cast on the cloth. Spell

components include a handful of crushed lilacs,
.an ounce of talcum, and a vial of green slime.

A baby cradle (8,000 gp, 8 days) first requires
the construction of a basic crib out of wood. The

Blashphor’s Magical Diapers and Crib of Pushing

”hapeeneere enn EERE”

crib is varnished, polished, and decorated to taste,
then enchanted to become a crib of pushing.
Components for this enchantment include a pinch
of powdered brass, a baby’s fingernail clipping,
and the pendulum from a clock. The crib is then
lined with the same kind of cloth used to make
diapers of enchantment.

Flowers of the maker’s choice are planted in
the flower boxes, and mint sprigs are planted in
the pot containing the parrot perch. A trained par-
rot, preferably one with a large vocabulary,
should be secured from a reputable trainer. (Ade-
quate training for this purpose takes a minimum
of 10 weeks.) The food tube can be made from a
small, hollow log. This is attached to the perch
along with a cup to receive the food as it spills
from the tube. A string hooked to a latch inside
the tube releases the food when pulled by the par-
rot.
A milk bladder is hung from the wooden rod
suspended over the cradle. The top end of the
bladder has a stopper or valve that can be opened
to pour in fresh milk. The tube end has a valve
that opens at the slightest pressure from an
infant’s lips, but otherwise remains closed. The
bladder is adjusted so that the tube end dangles
within easy reach of a reclining infant. The milk
bladder may be made from a leather flask, but an
air bladder from an aquatic creature makes a bet-
ter one—cleaned and dried, air bladders won’t
leak, and come equipped with natural valves. (In
his original cradle, Blashphor used the bladder of
a giant carp.) A mobile constructed of attractive
bits of crystal, bamboo, and other baubles is hung
next to the milk bladder. The mobile should have
no sharp edges and hang just out of the baby’s
reach. A string from the parrot’s food tube is con-
nected to it.

Statistics:

* Diaper: size varies but averages 2-foot square.
Up to 30 diapers can be made 15-yards of
enchanted cloth.

A diaper of enchantment is secured to an
infant with small leather straps, When the
baby relieves himself, the waste products are
instantly transmuted into a mixture of 95%
pure oxygen and 5% powdered talcum.

* Crib: 4'x2'x3'; parrot perch reached 5 feet
from ground. Weight of entire cradle: about 50
Ibs. Provides up to 12 hours of complete care

for a single infant (suggested age: 3-15
530

months). Milk bladder holds about one gallon.
The parrot food tube holds one week’s supply.

The crib of pushing is activated by the sound of
crying from its occupant. It will continue to gen-
tly rock back and forth as long as the baby cries.
If the baby is hungry, the tyke may suckle milk
from the milk bladder suspended overhead, The
crib is lined with cloth made from the same mate-
rial as the diaper of enchantment and transmutes
any milk that leaks from the bladder or dribbles
from the baby’s mouth.

At the base of the crib is a flowerpot of fresh
mint, fertilized by the droppings of the parrot
perched above. Colorful flowers grow from boxes
on each side of the crib. The mint and the flowers
keep the air smelling sweet and also add to an
aesthetically pleasing environment.

The specially trained parrot keeps an eye on
the infant and provides entertainment and speech
lessons. A string runs from its feeder to the
mobile; when the parrot pulls the string to fill its
cup, the string tugs on the mobile to amuse t
he baby. The parrot’s songs and chatter provide
entertainment while its repetition of words and
phrases helps the baby learn to talk.

Most importantly, the parrot has been trained to
alert the parents in case of an emergency. If specific

cues occur which indicate the baby may be in
trouble, such as gasping for air or extended crying,
the parrot flies like a homing pigeon to the parents
or a specified neighbor and squawks out a warning.

Most magical boats are identical in size to river
boats-20 to 30 feet long with a 10-foot beam
and a 3,000-pound cargo capacity (for larger ves-

Airboat
**XP Value:** 20,000 **GP Value:** 200,000
The Complete Wizard's Handbook

This is a stone canoe that measures 3 feet tall, 12
feet long, and 4 feet wide. Inside are five evenly
spaced stone planks, each capable of seating two
human-sized passengers. A plank on one end of
the canoe is marked with a star symbol in the

‘center. An airboat is also fitted with two sets of

stone oars that conform to ridges carved in both
sides of the craft. These boats respond to the
mental orders of their commanders (the charac-
ter sitting on the plank with the star symbol).
Only a wizard or priest can serve as an airboat
commander.

An airboat can move in any direction and in
any medium. While moving, an airboat is sur-
rounded by an aura of light that allows all of its
passengers to breathe normally, even when travel-
ing in airless space. The aura surrounds the craft
to a distance of 10 feet.

An airboat has a movement rate of 40. It can
move only if it is being rowed with at least one set
of the stone oars. If only one set is used, the craft
has a maximum movement rate of 20; if both sets
are used, the craft has a maximum speed of 40. A
single character can operate two oars, or two
characters can sit side by side on a plank, each
operating an oar. To move at maximum speed, the
rowers must complete a stroke every two sec-
onds; if the rate is less than this, the maximum
speed decreases proportionately. For instance, if
one set of oars is stroking once every four sec-
onds, that airboat has a maximum movement rate
of 10.

The commander must remain seated on the star

plank and can take no actions other than com-
manding the craft. If he or she moves from the
star seat, attempts to operate the oars, or takes
any other action, the airboat stops moving. Simi-
larly, if the captain’s concentration is broken, the
craft stops. If it stops moving while in the air, it
hovers in place. An airboat can hover in place for
only one turn, after that, it sinks gently to the
ground. If it stops moving while on water, the
boat simply drifts.

Canoe of Portage
**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 10,000
The Book of Marvelous Magic

This canoe appears to be and functions like an
ordinary canoe in all respects. When the com-
mand word is spoken, however, all nonliving
items within the canoe stick to it and become as
light as feathers. The canoe thus encumbered
(600 pounds maximum) can be carried as if
empty, requiring two persons and counting as 25
pounds of weight for each. A second command
word negates the effect, releasing the cargo and
returning it to normal.

Canoe of Travel

**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 10,000

This canoe appears to be and functions the
same as a normal canoe. When the command
word is spoken, the canoe resists the current,
staying in the same place, however rapid the
flow. It may then be paddled up or downstream
at normal rates, as if the water were calm and
still. A second command restores normal opera-
tion. The canoe of travel functions for up to
four hours per day. The total time may be spent
in any number of uses; however, each use costs
at least one turn.

DUNGEON MASTER Guide, 1st Edition

A folding boat is always discovered as a small
wooden “box”—about |-foot-long, 4-foot-wide,
and 4-foot-deep. It does, of course, radiate
magic if subjected to magical detection. The box
can be used to store items like any other box. If
the command word is given, however, the box
unfolds itself to form a boat 10 feet long, 4 feet
wide and 2 feet deep. A second command word
causes it to unfold a vessel 24 feet long, 8 feet
wide, by 6 feet deep.

In its smaller form, the boat has one pair of
oars, an anchor, a mast, and lateen sail. In its
larger form, the boat is decked, has single rowing
seats, five sets of oars, a steering oar, anchor, a
deck cabin, a mast, and square sail. The first
holds three or four people, the second carries 15
with ease.

A third word of command causes the boat to
fold itself into a box again. The words of com-
mand may be inscribed visibly or invisibly on the
box, or they may be written elsewhere—perhaps
on an item within the box. The words may have
been lost, making the boat useless (except as a
small box) until a finder discovers them (via /eg-
end lore, consulting a sage, the physical search of
a dungeon—your imagination is the key).

Folding Coracle
**XP Value:** 10,000 **GP Value:** 25,000
Moonshae

This device is similar to a folding boat, except
that it does not create such a grand vessel nor
does it take up as much space when collapsed.

The folding coracle looks like a small leather
patch when folded—about the size of a large
playing card. In fact, the patch may be sewn to a
piece of clothing as a means of disguising it.
When the command word is spoken, it expands
into a circular skin-and-strut craft about 8 feet in
diameter. Up to six human-sized passengers can
travel in it.

The amazing frog boat leaps on command,
jumping out of the water to a height of 120
yards and landing up to 360 yards away. It treats
its cargo, crew, and passengers gently and
causes no ill effects when leaping and landing.
On landing, its keel reaches a depth of only 5
feet and immediately returns to the usual 2-3
foot draft. The one-round leap is nearly vertical
and quite useful to prevent boarding, a monster
attack, etc. The frog boat can leap up to three
times per day.

The barge looks like a common vessel of the
Rhennee. It is 14 feet wide and 36 feet long, on
command it can move at twice normal speed or
60 miles per day, for an unlimited time and under
its own magical power. Four heavy crossbows are
mounted along each side, and more can be added.
The barge has a lugsail that can be raised in
windy weather to hide the magical nature of its
movement.

The hasty barge magically repels water crea-

nets, and gear, or may be used as an extra cargo
hold. However, whatever the space holds cannot
exceed its 3,000-pound total cargo capacity. The
entrance to the extra space is a secret trap door
on the inside the hull. If a house boat takes 20 or
more hull points of damage, the space and the
door both disappear, casting all contents into the
Ethereal Plane.

Ice
**XP Value:** 1,500 **GP Value:** 7,500
The Book of Marvelous Magic
This boat can be used as a magical river boat.
When placed on any icy or snow-covered sur-
face, two flat runners, similar to skis, appear
upon command; each runner is the same length
as the boat and firmly mounted on struts pro-
jecting downwards from the hull. The boat is
lifted, its keel 5 feet above the surface of the ice,
as the struts and runners appear. The runners
enable the boat to move about as if waterborne.
Each runner has 10 hp and disappears if dam-
aged for more than that amount. If the boat falls

over because it loses a runner, it takes 1d6

points of hull damage. The runners are immune
to all normal damage and can be affected only
by magical weapons (treat as AC 4) or spells. An
ice boat can move about with only one runner,
but at 10 feet per turn.

Mistboat
**XP Value:** 4,500 **GP Value:** 45,000

POLYHEDRON Newszine 58

This powerful magical item only works on water;
it is a miniature ivory carving of a sailing ship.
However, when the command word “mistform” is
spoken, the carving turns into full-size ship made
entirely of mist. Despite its appearance, the ship
is quite solid and has the statistics of a carrack
(length 120 feet, width 20 feet, movement 21,
carrying capacity 685 tons). The ship has 70 hull
points, and is equipped with one light mangonel,
one medium mangonel, and four ballistae with 10
rounds of ammunition each. It requires a crew of
20. The mistboat is impervious to nonmagical
fire and cold, and to crushing attacks, excluding
ramming and constriction. Wall of fog repairs one
point of damage to the ship per level of the caster;
solid fog repairs two points per level. If the ship
sustains more than 70 points of damage, the mist
fades and the ivory miniature turns to dust. A
mistboat can be used three times a week, for a
maximum of 24 hours each time.

Portable Canoe
**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 10,000
Tome of Magic
This canvas canoe is capable of comfortably
holding two passengers, The canoe includes two
wooden paddles. The portable canoe can fold
itself into a 6-inch-square packet, about an inch
thick, and weighing just under a pound. Except

for the paddles, the portable canoe must be emp-
tied of all other objects before it can fold. Folding
the canoe requires a command word and five
rounds; unfolding requires a second command
word and two rounds.

Quaal’s Mystical Feather Token
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 7,000
1992 Trading Card 30
Whenever this token is even slightly wet, it turns
into a boat. When the boat dries out completely, it
turns back into its feather token form. This can be
especially troublesome if the owner of the token
is caught in the rain without sufficient protection
from moisture. The boat can carry up to 32 men
and their gear. The token was supposed to be
usable only once, but it appears to have had per-
manency successfully cast upon it.

Semekhtet Barge

**XP Value:** 1,500 **GP Value:** 9,000
Nightrage

Koresh Teyd uses this magical ship to travel
underground. Like a dwarven rockship, it moves
through solid rock as easily as an ordinary boat
moves through water. Also like a rockship, barge
passengers are protected from the environment
and can breathe and speak normally. However, a
Semekhtet barge is not so rare nor hard to pro-
duce as a rockship, and it has figured promi-
nently in Nithian folklore and mythology. (Thus
the name; Semekhtet was a legendary hero who
owned a similar barge.) Though Koresh Teyd
received the barge as a gift from Thanatos, there
is nothing inherent in the barge’s power that nec-
essarily demonstrates Immortal magic.

Treat the Semekhtet barge as an undersea boat,
except that it moves through rock, not water.

Smuggler’s
**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 10,000
The Book of Marvelous Magic

This boat rolls over on command. As it rolls,
gravity reverses for all creatures and objects
within the hull, and a water breathing effect pro-
tects all passengers and crew. The boat still floats,
but only its keel and 2 to 3 feet of draft are above
the water. The smugglers boat can be used upside
down indefinitely—it is extremely useful for
secret, water travel.

GREYHAWK Adventures

This large merchant ship is enchanted to with-
stand the violent storms and huge waves of the
Gearnat in spring and autumn. Many merchants
pooled their wealth to pay the wizard who
enchanted it. A bloody fight erupted afterwards
when the deed of ownership mysteriously disap-
peared, Now the Storm Rider is an item for any-
one strong enough to take it and crafty enough to
keep it. The vessel ignores the effects of storms,
sailing as if in a brisk breeze at all times. Waves
flatten out when the keel touches them and the
effects of rain or snow do not affect the ship.

**XP Value:** 10,000 **GP Value:** 50,000
1992 Fantasy Collector Card 33
This 1-foot by 6-inch by 6-inch box unfolds into a
jaunty vessel, 90 feet long and 17 feet wide that
sails itself through waters of little or no effective
depth (though there must be some water). The ship
is constantly at full sail with the wind blowing in
whatever direction the sailor wishes. Another
unusual feature of this craft is that it cannot be hit
by physical or magical attacks of any type. (All rid-
ers and equipment in the boat can take damage, but

the boat itself remains unharmed.) The boat also
plays pleasant fife and drum music at the command
of the user, boosting the morale of all by one.

Tub of Sailing
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 5,000

This tub is identical to a tub of lard, but it cannot
create anything. If placed in any liquid, it floats
and can support up to 500 pounds of weight with-
out sinking. If a creature sits in the tub and com-
mands it to sail, it moves at a Movement Rate of
18, It is not affected by wind, but it is easily dam-
aged (5 hull points, AC 9).

Undersea
**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 18,000
DUNGEON Magazine 9
This item is identical to a 30-foot-long, standard
riverboat and can be used as one. As it is magical,
however, its Armor Class is 4 and has 40 Hull
Points. No rowers or sailors are needed if the
command words are known. The command words
for the undersea boat are simple anagrams:

with grips so passengers won’t drift away.

This item looks and functions like a sword +1 in
all respects. When immersed in water and the

masted boat with sails (treat as a small sailing
ship). The xebec remains in ship form for as long
as needed, a second command returns it to sword

Bone

A magical bone is a wand-sized object that
appears similar to a human arm or leg bone. A
magical bone can be used only by a human who
holds it and recites the proper command word.
These bones cannot be damaged except by acid, a
disintegration spell, or a wish, all of which cause
the bone to crumble to dust. However, any magi-
cal bone can be turned by a priest; the bone is
treated as if it were a spirit, and a successful
attempt, whether to turn or destroy it, causes the
bone to become nonmagical for 1d4+2 rounds. If
the bone was operating while turned, it resumes
its magical activity after the delay and cannot be
turned by the same priest for an hour.

of Animation
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 5,000
The Book of Marvelous Magic

This bone grows into a human skeleton (as the
monster) on command, The skeleton understands
and obeys the person animating it, but cannot
speak, even if a speak with dead spell is cast. If
given a weapon, it fights on command (AC 4; hp
30, otherwise identical to the monster descrip-
tion). The skeleton can be damaged by any sort of
weapon and disappears if.“slain,” resuming its
original bone form. It can carry up to 100 pounds
weight. If turned (as a spirit, as any bone), the
skeleton disappears, replaced by the original bone
for 1d4+2 rounds; the skeleton then reappears
and resumes its previous activity. A dispel magic
spell automatically causes the skeleton to stop,
paralyzed, for 1d4+2 rounds. The bone of anima-
tion can create a skeleton once per day, and the
creature will serve for one hour or until slain.

uously and requires no concentration. The bone

dances around the victim’s head and shoulders,

trying to interfere and cause distraction. No
attack rolls are made. Instead, the victim must
make a saving throw vs. spell for each round of
the bone’s attack. If the throw is successful, the
bone has no effect; if it fails, the victim takes one
point of damage from bruising and cannot cast a
spell or utter a command word during that round.
The bone of bruising stops dancing on command
or when the victim dies.

Clapper
**XP Value:** 150 **GP Value:** 1,500

DraGon Magazine 181
Dragon bones (or oracle bones, as they are some-
times called) are commonly sold in most apothe-
caries across Kara-Tur for the relatively low price
of 1-6 tael each. However, nearly all of these items
are surely fakes, perhaps animal bones or frag-
ments of turtle shells. True dragon bones are the
polished and enchanted shoulder blades of Oriental
dragons, and they would never be sold so cheaply if
properly recognized. One of these enchanted bones
can aid a shukenja’s casting of divination spells.
Theoretically, the dragon’s spirit travels between
the diviner and a divinity, ensuring an accurate
response through its ties with the Celestial Palace.
The process involves scratching a question into the
surface of the dragon bone with a sharp stylus, then
carving a groove next to the query. The next step
involves touching the groove with the red-hot point,

causing a maze of cracks to spread across the
bone’s surface. By interpreting the length and pat-
tern of the cracks, a shukenja learns the answer.

A dragon bone adds 10% to the success of
augury, doubles the duration of find the path,
allows know history to be cast at twice normal dis-
tance; adds +1 to rolls on Artifact Table 1-24:
Divination Results, and is suggested as a material
component in powerful divination spells (to which
it adds 10% to the chances of success). The com-
plex process involved in utilizing a dragon bone
takes one turn, which replaces the casting time for
all of the above spells. Using this item in casting a
spell does not always cause the bone to vanish, be
destroyed, or become useless; it may be used a
number of times equal to twice the age category of
the dragon from which it came (roll 1d12 for ran-
dom determination), Bones from older dragons
have large surface areas on which to carve ques-
tions. If a dragon bone is found as part of a hoard,
it may have already been used in previous divina-
tions (DM’s discretion; 1d4 suggested).

A shukenja of the 10th level or higher may
enchant a dragon bone if access to a deceased Ori-
ental dragon’s skeleton is possible. Since the requi-
site bones are taken from a dragon’s shoulder
blades, a shukenja may create two dragon bones
from each dragon. The bones must be cleaned,
stained with exotic oils (the ingredients for which
cost 20 ch’ien), and polished. Since an Oriental
dragon’s bones are magical by their very nature,
the fina] enchantment requires but a single casting
of holy symbol. The chance that the enchantment
“holds” is equal to 70%, plus 1% per level of the
caster, the DM should roll this secretly, with 90%
being the maximum chance of success. An unsuc-
cessful enchantment results in a worthless item
or-——on an enchantment roll of 00—cursed dragon
bones. A cursed dragon bone functions like its cor-
rectly enchanted counterpart but provides false
answers, sometimes (10% chance); a warped ver-
sion of the truth or the direct opposite of the cor-
rect answer, often (80% of the time).

of Slaying
**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 10,000
The Book of Marvelous Magic
Upon command, this bone becomes a magical
club +3 (normal damage 1d4), gaining that bonus

or 20 is made while using the club +3 (before any

adjustments), the victim must make a saving
throw vs. magic or be struck dead by the blow,
instantly reduced to 0 hit points. This does apply
to undead. The bone functions once a day for one
turn per use.

of Turning
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 5,000
The Book of Marvelous Magic

This bone may be thrown at any undead monster
as a missile weapon (ranges 40/80/120) with a +4
bonus to attack rolls. If the bone hits, the monster
is affected as if turned by a 15th-level priest,
although the bone may be used by any human
class. The bone of turning must be retrieved to be
thrown again, but there is otherwise no limit to
the number of uses. If an attempt fails by too low
a score on 2d6 after the bone hits, it has no fur-
ther affect on that creature.

Bonnet

Bonnets, in agricultural and industrial cultures,
are wide-brimmed, flimsy hats that are thick
enough to shelter the wearer’s face and neck from
the sun. In tribal cultures, bonnets are head-
dresses displaying or made from the tribe’s or the
wearer’s totem (be it feathers, sprigs of oak, or the
hide of a powerful and respected animal).

damage with weapons. The Strength lasts for one
turn and can be used only once per day.

Book

Books, Librams, Manuals, Spellbooks, and
Tomes—in the AD&D game system, each of
these terms has a unique definition:

* Books may be used only by priests and some-
times raise a specific character statistic.

* Librams are books used only by wizards, and
occasionally boost stats.

* Manuals may be used by both fighters and
thieves, and some include boosts to stats.

* Spellbooks contain spells and surprises. Most
are restricted to priests and wizards, but a few
may be used by any class.

* Tomes may be used by ail classes and some
grant boosts to stats.

All magical books, librams, manuals, and
tomes appear to be normal works of arcane lore.
Each is indistinguishable from others by visual
examination or by magical detection.

A wish spell can identify or classify a magical
work. Other spells, notably alter reality, com-
mune, contact higher planes, limited wish, and
true seeing are useless. A wish reveals the general
contents of a book, telling what classes or charac-
teristics are most affected (not necessarily bene-
fitted) by the work. A second wish is required to
learn the book’s exact contents.

After being studied by a character, most magi-
cal works vanish forever. However, one that is not
beneficial to the reader may become attached to
the character, and he or she is unable to get rid of
it. If the work benefits another character align-
ment, the owner is geased to conceal and guard it.
As DM, you should use your judgment and imag-
ination as to exactly how these items are to be
treated, use the rules in this section as parameters.

of Amon
**XP Value:** 6,500 **GP Value:** 17,000
Kingdom of Nithia

This relic has no known origin. It has existed since
the days of the Nithian Empire on the surface
world. It is a large volume weighing nearly 80
pounds, bound in what appears to be red dragon
hide with raised, unreadable glyphs on the cover.
Raised areas, like veins under skin radiate out from
the glyphs. Sixteen eyes of precious gemstone stare
endlessly out from the cover of the book. To the
casual observer, it appears to breathe.

It is rumored that only the Pharaoh, or the

Pharaoh’s high priest, is able to read it freely. If
569

 

184

X
anyone else tries, they must save vs. spell or go
mad (Intelligence permanently drops to 1). Those
who keep their sanity see only blank pages.

According to legend, each page bears the name
of an ancient Nithian colony, far away from the
Known World. If the Pharaoh wishes to visit one
of these places, he or she need simply open the
book, and read the name written there. The book
then becomes a gate to that particular place, and
the Pharaoh may travel freely to it. However, due
to the spell of preservation, no gates can be
opened to the surface; and if more than an hour
elapses, the user is automatically returned to
Nithia. Since this is a Nithian artifact, the book
itself is constrained to stay within the country’s
borders, and therefore teleports itself back to its
resting place if taken out of the country.

of Binding Souls

**GP Value:** 60,000
DUNGEON Magazine 27
Bound in the hide of a fiend, this is a small, thick
book roughly 9 inches high, 6 wide, and 11%
inches thick. It strongly radiates a pulsing aura of
evil, noticeable even without magical detection.
Its worn pages of thin flesh are covered with
strange sigils and glyphs. Merely looking at the
book’s evil script causes any nonchaotic evil
being to take 3d6 hp electrical damage (no save
allowed) and make a saving throw vs. spell or go
insane. The form that the insanity takes is left for
the DM to decide, but requires the casting of a
heal spell by a priest of at least 18th-level to dis-
pel. Any nonchaotic, evil being who retains pos-
session of the book for more than three days
suffers from a vile rotting disease, similar to
mummy rot, with no save allowed. Curing this
effect requires casting a cure disease spell, also
by a priest of at least 18th level.

The book is a relic that contains the knowledge
and power to ensnare the essence of a deceased
being and bind it to one’s will. The captured
essence manifests itself in a form similar to that
of a ghost, except that its Hit Dice are equal to
that which it possessed in life. The ghost is com-
pletely under the power of the book’s user.

The book is written in an archaic, evil lan-
guage and can be fully understood only by a
chaotic evil priest of at least 10th level.

The casting of an incantation requires that the
spell be cast over the remains of the essence’s for-
mer body, and that the caster know the spirit’s

**XP Value:** —

Disks of Mishakal

"neice

name. Success of the incantation begins at a base
1% chance, rolled once every 12 hours of the
incantation. This chance is modified by the fol-
lowing—for every level of the spirit, subtract 2%.
For every level of the caster (and those of any.
assistants chanting at the same), add 1%. Lastly,
add 1% for each 12 hour period in which the
incantation has been in progress.

Should the incantation be interrupted or halted
at any time, all progress made up to that point is
lost, and any new attempts to ensnare the essence
begins at the base 1% chance again. Also, should
a 99% or greater (unmodified) chance be rolled
in any ensnaring attempt, the essence eludes the
pursuers (hell hounds from the Abyss) and breaks
the spell’s hold. This has the same effect as break-
ing off the incantation.

Once ensnared, however, there is little hope for
the spirit, as the power of the book quickly binds
it to a material form. Escape occurs only when
the new material form is destroyed or when the
caster loses control of the book. This doesn’t
mean that the caster must sleep with book
clutched to breast, but it does require that the
book always be in a place of the caster’s choosing
and readily accessible.

Should the caster lose control of the book, the
spirit becomes free to direct all of its energies to the
death of its captor, attacking until it is destroyed or
the caster is killed, at which point the spirit is
allowed to return to its final plane of existence.

‘The book is immune to normal and most magi-
cal destruction. It must be destroyed by some spe-
cial means, such as throwing it into a particular
volcano, perhaps on the Elemental Plane of Fire,
or by immersion in the acidic blood of some
huge, ancient black dragon. The particular means
of the book’s destruction are left to the DM and
could provide an exciting and dangerous quest.

Disks of Mishakal II
**XP Value:** 100,000 **GP Value:** 500,000
Tales of the Lance

The once-lost Disks of Mishakal, are steeped in
legend. These disks, crafted during the Age of
Might, provide a treatise on the rituals and wor-
ship of the gods of Krynn. Each of the 160 disks
is made of hammered platinum, thin as a quith-pa
wafer and three hand-spans wide. A rod of steel
pierces one edge of each disk, binding the disks
together. Arcane glyphs engraved on both sides of
the disk tell the secrets of the gods. As with any
sacred text, the disks answer a multitude of ques-
tions, but raise a many more.

The disks are said to have been commissioned
by Karthay Pah, though the actual work was com-
pleted at the hands of Eriel Caladon nae Tempus
and a triumvirate of Silvanesti scholars. When the
kingpriests arose, the elves feared for the loss of
this divinely inspired work. Therefore, they sent it
secretly across the land to their brethren in Qua-
linesti. Barbarians from New Sea massacred the
caravan and the disks were lost.

In 255 PC, the disks were rediscovered in
Zhakar—the ogres wanted to melt the disks and
forge them into coins. The disks somehow
escaped melting (perhaps by divine intervention
or a unique magical property). Later, a gray
dwarf named Forlorn Ironbeard summoned the

punish the unfaithful dwarves.

Word of the lost disks reached the kingpriest and
a royal bounty was set for their recovery. In addi-
tion to the glory and power the disks would pro-
vide, the kingpriest knew that quests for the disks
would preoccupy the Knights of Solamnia. Many
valiant knights sought the holy disks, but none ever
found them, At last, the brash plainsman Clear-

brook set out upon the quest. His travels took him
to world’s end and beyond, into the mists of the
Abyss. When Clearbrook returned to Xak Tsaroth,
he bore the disks in a robe of bison skin. He deliv-
ered the relic to the priests of Mishakal, and then
led his pursuers (spies of the kingpriest) into the
Darken Woods—none ever returned.

In Xak Tsaroth, the disks lay hidden. After the
Cataclysm, the barbarian priestess Goldmoon

‘recovered the disks from the ruins. At war’s end

the fabulous disks were ensconced in the temple
of Mishakal at Palanthus for the most devout and
pure souls to study and learn the teachings of the
gods of good.

Anyone with good alignment may touch the
disks, and those with a proficiency in ancient
languages may read them. Those of Neutral or
Evil alignment who attempt to touch or read the
disks, are struck by a lightning bolt that arcs
from the disks, doing 3d10 points damage.
Although priests of Paladine strongly warn peti-
tioners that “they must be at peace with
Mishakal and Paladine to read the disks safely,”
one or two unworthy readers die every year. To
the worthy, however, patient and penitent study
of the disks can unfold the mysteries of death,
creation, and life.

This compilation is a treatise on the construction
and animation of golems. It contains all informa-
tion and incantations needed to make one of the
nine sorts of golems.

The construction and animation of a golem
takes a considerable amount of time and costs
quite a bit as well. During the construction and
animation process, a single wizard or priest must
have the manual at hand to study, and must not be
interrupted. The type of manual found is found
by rolling 1d20 and consulting the table below:

Once the golem is finished, the writing fades
and the book is consumed by flames. When the
ashes of the manual are sprinkled on the golem,
the figure becomes fully animated. It is assumed
that the user of the manual is of at least the 10th
level. For every level of experience under 10th,
there is a cumulative 10% chance that the golem
falls to pieces within one turn of completion, due
to the maker’s imperfect understanding.

A priest who reads a work for wizards loses
1d6(x10,000) experience points. A wizard read-
ing a priestly work loses one level of experience.
The DM must decide in advance for whom the
book is intended. Any other class suffers 6d6
points of damage for opening the work.

RAVENLOFT MC Appendix
According to rumor, there are magical volumes
that detail the procedures used in the creation of
Ravenloft golems. Like the traditional golem
manuals found in other realms, each of these
books describes how to fashion and animate one
type of golem. In addition, the dark powers of
Ravenloft favor the creation of these golems

"iin

over their more mundane cousins, so that any
manual of golems brought into Ravenloft has a
75% chance of transforming into a Book of
Ravenloft Golems when it enters the demiplane.
Such books do not revert to normal when
removed from the demiplane, but the creation of
the golems they describe is not possible outside
of that domain, making these tomes all but
worthless in other lands.

When a Book of Golems is found in Ravenloft,
roll percentile dice on the following table to
determine the type of golem it can create:

‘Under creator, the following nomenclature is
used: P—Priest

The creation of any kind of Ravenloft golem is
a dark and dangerous process for the creator. The
creature must be created with loving care and
special magical spells woven over the body to
bring it to life.

Like traditional golems, those fashioned with the
aid of the dark powers of Ravenloft have a great
hatred for all living things. They are kept in check
only by the will of their creators, who face death at
their hands if they ever escape and become free-
willed creatures. While the spells used to create a
golem usually enslave it so that it cannot refuse to
obey its creator, there is a 10% chance that any
Ravenloft golem will break free of that control.
After that, it devotes all of its time and energy to the
destruction of its creator. Once a golem is created, it
is entitled to a saving throw vs. spell once per
month, on the full moon. Failure indicates that it
must serve for another month, while success indi-
cates that it has become free-willed.

The rituals to animate the body (once it has
been built) require one full month (from full
moon to full moon) and cannot be interrupted in
any way or the entire enchantment process must
start anew. In all cases, the spells used may come
from any source (including devices or scrolls). If
a spell is cast on behalf of the golem’s creator by
a second individual, that spell must contain spe-

cial alterations to make it sympathetic to the crea-
578

ture’s would-be master. There is no additional
cost for these alterations.

Doll Golem: Only a priest of at least 15th level
can create a doll golem. These creatures resemble
a child’s toy—often a baby doll or stuffed animal.
Bone golems can serve as either the guardians of
children or as murdering creations too foul to
contemplate. Construction of the doll’s body
takes only two weeks, but the cost of components
and enchanted elements of the golem reaches
15,000 gp. The spells needed to complete the ani-
mation are imbue with spell ability, Tasha’s
uncontrollable hideous laughter, (un)holy word,
bless, and prayer. The first known examples of
this type of golem turned up in the land of San-
guinia, in the hands of a traveling priest. While
his name has been lost to memory, it is believed
that he researched and built the doll to protect his
wife and daughter as they traveled around this
dark land. History does not record the final fate
of that pilgrimage. It is rumored that the doll sur-
vived and still haunts the domains of Ravenloft
today, but there is no solid evidence that this is
the case.

Gargoyle Golem: This creature is fashioned in
the image of a real gargoyle and is often placed as
a warden atop buildings, cathedrals, or tombs. It
is most similar to the stone golem, save that can
be built only by priests of at least 16th level. The
body must be carved frorn a single slab of granite
(weighing 3,000 pounds and taking two months
to complete) and prepared with components cost-
ing 75,000 gp. Of this money, 15,000 gp is used
to create vestments that can be reused, so a sec-
ond golem could be created for only 60,000 gp.
The spells required to complete the process are
bless, exaction, (un)holy word, stone shape, con-
jure earth elemental, and prayer. The first gar-
goyle golem was fashioned at the command of
Viad Drakov, Lord of Falkovnia, as a means of
defending his castle. Eventually, the secret of
their construction leaked out and others began to
build them. It is rumored that none of these crea-
tures can attack Drakov, and even that they may
all secretly serve him—this may or may not be
true. Although none can report ever having seen
Drakov challenged by such a creature, it does
seem unlikely.

Glass Golem: Fashioned by either priests or
wizards of at least 14th level, the glass golem is
composed entirely of stained glass. Perhaps the
most artistic of all known Ravenloft golems, its

"eects cemicamsianiiitimi

creation takes three months and requires an out-
lay of 100,000 gp. In addition to the materials
required, the following spells must be used:
glassteel, animate object, prismatic spray, rain-
bow, and wish, Because of the mixture of spells,
this type of golem is usually built by multi- or
dual-classed characters or with the aid of a
powerful assistant. While the origins of some
types of Ravenloft golems are firmly estab-
lished, the first appearance of glass golems is
not recorded with certainty in any known
record. It is believed that they were created by a
spell caster who fancied himself an artist (hence
their eerie beauty), but the identity of that sorry
man cannot be guessed. Some say it was the
lord of a small domain (one of the so-called
Islands of Terror) who died at the hands of a
brave band of adventurers.

Mechanical Golem: A nightmare of technol-
ogy and magic, the mechanical golem is an intri-
cate device that depends on both magic and

‘machinery to operate. It is the only known man-

ner of golem that can be built by any class of
character, even those without spell casting abili-
ties, if they meet the requirements listed below.
Construction of the body requires a full year of
work (with no more than two interruptions, each
no longer than 30 days, permitted) and an outlay
of 125,000 gp. Almost half of that money
(60,000 gp) is spent on the creation of a prop-
erly equipped laboratory, and additional golems
may be built for only 65,000 gp using this exist-
ing equipment. The person building the body
must have an Intelligence score of not less than
16 and either experience with fine craftsman-
ship (trained as a watchmaker) or a Dexterity
score of not less than 17, The animation of the
golem requires the following spells: animate
object, fabricate, grease, chain lighining, and
either major creation or wish. The first of these
horrors was created at the order of Easan the
Mad, Lord of Vechor. A twisted man who has
always been fascinated by technological devices,
Easan is said to have foreseen the elements of
this creature in a study of a falling star. While
most doubt that this is anything but more proof
of Easan’s dementia, few can challenge the obvi-
ous conclusion that these evil creatures are a
mix of magic and technology that must surely
have come from the mind of a lunatic.

Seven of the seals are gold and shiny, five are of
dull, charred, and tarnished lead.

The runes on the seals are command words that
activate the magic of the seal. When activated, the
scroll summons a magical entity that the wielder
may command for 3d6 turns. Each of the seven
(gold) remaining seals summons a different being
(the proper element need not be available for ele-

This is a work of ineffable evil—meat and drink to
priests of that alignment. To fully consume the con-
tents requires one week of study, but once this has
been accomplished, the evil priest gains one point of
Wisdom and enough experience points to place the
character halfway into the next level of experience.

Priests neither good nor evil who read this
book either lose 3d4(x10,000) experience points
or become evil without benefit from the book;

FO cece eeeelieee ienllliaeIeeaeestiemeeene li sleiarnelieeientiedl

there is a 50% chance for either. Good priests
perusing the pages of this unspeakable book, the
Book of Vile Darkness must successfully save vs.
poison or die; and if they do not die, they must
successfully save vs. spell or become perma-
nently insane. In the latter event, even if the save
is successful, the priest loses 250,000 experience
points, less 10,000 for each point of Wisdom.

Other characters of good alignment suffer 5d6
points of damage from handling the tome, and if
they look inside, there is an 80% chance a night
hag attacks the character that night. Nonevil neu-
tral characters suffer 5d4 points of damage from
handling the book, and reading its pages causes
them to succeed on a save vs. poison or become
evil, immediately seeking out an evil priest to
confirm their new alignment (see the Book of
Exalted Deeds for details).

In Ravenloft: Reading this book requires a
Ravenloft powers check. When the week long
reading is complete, the evil priest gains just
enough XPs to rise two levels—not the paltry
half-level increase granted in other realms. The
priest still gains one point of Wisdom, and char-
acters of good alignment suffer a curse if a save
vs. spell succeeds. In Ravenloft, curses can be
excruciatingly deadly.

+ A thief wearing the boots gains a +10% bonus

* The Dexterity of any character wearing the
boots is increased by one point for all purposes
where the hands are not involved. Thus, a thief
cannot claim a bonus to skills such as open
locks, but a bonus to Armor Class may apply,
and likewise a bonus applies to Dexterity
checks in certain situations (to avoid a fall).

* The wearer gains the tightrope walking profi-
ciency; if this is already possessed, a -4 bonus
modifier applies to all proficiency check die
rolls when wearing the boots.

A wearer of boots of balance cannot claim a fur-

of balance cannot be added to the bonus gained if
the wearer also uses gauntlets of dexterity.

accomplices to do so. Hence, to obey the geas, if
the wearer is attacked in the middle of a robbery,
the thief must either flee, abandon the stolen
goods (which cannot be recovered later), or spend
the first few rounds getting out of the boots. Such
an item might be the perfect gift for a wizard to
give to a thief of dubious morality.

The boots are created by casting enchant an
item on a pair of finely-worked leather boots,
preferably of elven manufacture, followed by the
casting of silence 15' radius by a priest, perma-
nency and geas. With the enchantment complete,

the silence applies only to the footsteps of the .

wearer of the boots.

Moccasins of Free Movement

ii pneteneseeeeerenmeeeemmmemmmmmmmmmmnccnlll

of Jogging
**XP Value:** 1,200 **GP Value:** 6,000
DraGon Magazine 72

This special footgear allows a jock to jog ata
steady pace for six hours without needing to rest.
These boots are also referred to as “sneakers,”
probably because they allow jocks to add +1 to all
surprise rolls.

of Levitation
**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 15,000
DUNGEON MASTER Guide, 1st Edition

Like other magical boots, these soft boots expand
or contract to fit any feet from giant to halfling in
size. Boots of levitation enable the wearer to
ascend or descend vertically, at will. The speed of
ascent or descent is 20 feet per round, with no
limitation on duration. The amount of weight the
boots can Jevitate is randomly determined in 14-
pound increments by roHing 1d20 and adding the
result to a base of 280 pounds (a given pair of
boots can Jevitate from 294 to 560 pounds of
weight). Thus, an ogre could wear such boots, but
its weight would be too great to levitate. (See the
2nd-level wizard spell, levitation.)

Loki’s
**XP Value:** 6,000 **GP Value:** 47,500
Gods, Demigods, & Heroes
These boots combine the powers of water walk-
ing, flying, traveling, and speed.

Midnight Slasher’s
**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 14,000
RAVENLOFT MC Appendix II: Children of the Night

The Slasher wears a pair of drowish boots of
elvenkind that enable him to move silently with a
95% chance of success. His boots, along with his
cloak, work only in darkness—they give the
Slasher triple normal chances for surprise.

Moccasins of Free Movement
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 10,000
Maztica Campaign Set

These beaded leather shoes are marvelous talismans
that convey multiple effects—they function as boots
of elvenkind and allow their wearer to move silently,
they also permit a full movement rate, whatever the
footing—as long as the character is walking. Thus,
he or she can cross swamps, wade through shallow
water (but not swim), even cross a pool of sticky tar,
as if walking on smooth, level ground.

Boots of the North

of the North
**XP Value:** 1,500 **GP Value:** 7,500
DUNGEON MASTER Guide, 1st Edition

This footgear bestows many powers upon the
wearer. First, the character is able to travel across
snow at normal rate of movement, leaving no
tracks. The boots also enable the wearer to travel
at half normal movement rate across the most
slippery ice (horizontal surfaces only, not vertical
or sharply slanted ones) without falling or slip-
ping. Boots of the north warm the wearer, so that
even in a temperature as low as -50° F is com-
fortable with only scant clothing—a loin cloth
and cloak, for instance. If the wearer of the boots
is fully dressed in cold-weather clothing, temper-
atures as low as -100° F have no effect.

In a DRAGONLANCE Campaign: On Ansalon,
of course, boots of the north are called boots of
the south.

of Pinching
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** 1,800
The Book of Marvelous Magic
These boots appear to be and function as boots of
tracks but they cannot be removed until a remove
curse is applied. They pinch the wearer’s feet
when the tracking function is used, slowing the
wearer’s movement rate by 1 MV point, cumula-
tive with each turn or part of a turn of use, Any
victim reduced to zero movement must be carried
or magically transported about and cannot walk;
the effect disappears when the boots are removed.

Runjoye’s Winged

**XP Value:** 2,500 **GP Value:** 12,500
1992 Fantasy Collector Card 147
Runjoye’s boots are of better quality than most
other winged boots. They possess a flying speed
of 21 and maneuverability is class A. They are
usable for up to four hours per day, rather than the
usual two (for every 12 hours of uninterrupted
nonuse, the boots regain two hours of flying
time). Like other owners of winged boots, Run-
joye doesn’t need to maintain concentration in
order to fly, so he can cast spells while airborne.
Unlike other winged boots, Runjoye’s quit work-
ing quite suddenly when their magic expires. For-
tunately, he wears a ring of feather falling for just

such an emergency.

Shalandain’s Boots of Starstriding
**XP Value:** 3,000 **GP Value:** 15,000
1992 Fantasy Collector Card 133
Shalandain won these magical boots from a scro
during a card game. The boots allow Shalandain
to tread upon the gravity plane of any ship with-
out drifting away. Movement is cut in half, but
jumping down to the gravity plane does not result
in oscillation. Shalandain can jump from the
gravity plane to the gravity plane or even the deck
of another ship as if she had the jumping profi-

ciency,

of Speed
**XP Value:** 2,500 **GP Value:** 20,000
DUNGEON Master Guide, 1st Edition
These boots enable the wearer to run at the speed
of a light horse-24 base movement. For every
10 pounds of weight over 200 pounds, the wearer
is slowed by 1 MV, so a 180-lb human with 60
pounds of gear would move at 20 base MV.

For every hour of continuous fast movement,
the wearer must rest an hour. No more than eight
hours of continuous fast movement are possible
before the wearer must rest. Boots of speed give a
+2 bonus to Armor Class in combat situations in
which movement of this sort is possible.

Spider’s Boots of Stealth

**XP Value:** 3,500 **GP Value:** 25,000
POLYHEDRON Newszine 90
“Spider” was the nickname of the premier thief of
the city of Rel Astra. No one knew his real name,
origin, or anything else about him, which was
precisely the way the thief wanted it. Spider was a
loner, a half-elf who never formed a close rela-
tionship with anyone in the Rel Astran Thieves’
Guild.

There could be no doubt that he was the finest
and most successful burglar in living memory,
and his loyalty to the guild was never in question.
Still, those in the guild considered him a malevo-
lent menace. He was openly, undeniably evil.
That fact and his appearance and dress, led to
rumors that he worshiped of Lolth, the spider
queen.

Spider was obsessed with his alias and nick-
name, and very flamboyant when on a caper. His
face was tattooed in a web-pattern, and much of
his clothing was embroidered with similar motifs.
His boots and cloak were known to be enchanted,

and speculation was rife whether he had found
609

Boots of Sriding and Springing

"algae eee nennieeade name eiannemnpeee naam

the items in his travels and they had subsequently
shaped his personality and tastes. Regardless, it
was known he had at least three additional pairs
of the enchanted boots made so that one pair
would always be clean.

Spider's boots of stealth are black, calf-length
suede boots with a crisscrossing pattern of silver
webs, They act as slippers of spider climbing.
However, when worn by a thief, their other pow-
ers activate. The boots increase a thief’s abilities
to move silently and hide in shadows by 15%. In
addition, a thief can move along natural webs at a
rate of 6 and cannot be stuck in any kind of nat-
ural or magical web.

of Star Striding
**XP Value:** 3,000 **GP Value:** 20,000
DRAGON Magazine 159
These boots are similar to all magical boots,
shrinking or expanding to fit any S-M size crea-
ture. However, their usefulness is limited to space
adventurers. The boots allow a wearer to walk
along a gravity plane without drifting away from
the ship. The boots allow movement across any
gravity plane, though movement is half normal
due to the lack of a solid surface.
A character falling or jumping from a ship
toward a gravity plane comes to rest on the plane

 

with no oscillation through the plane. Any char-
acter falling prone on the plane remains there;
when the character orients so as to tell which end
is up and changes position, the boots interact with
the gravity plane and the wearer “bobs” up to the
surface of the gravity plane until he or she stands
on it.

The boots allow for running and jumping to
other gravity planes at the wearer’s regular move-
ment rate. Due to the flexibility of the gravity
planes, the boots give the wearer a Jumping pro-
ficiency when used to leap onto other gravity
planes. The wearer can also use the jumping pro-
ficiency when jumping from the gravity plane to
the ship with no damage or penalties.

of Stomping

**XP Value:** 900 **GP Value:** 1,800
The Book of Marvelous Magic
These boots appear and function as boots of
speed but only affect movement rates, not Armor
Class, number of attacks, or anything else. When
they are used to move quickly, they make the
footsteps of the wearer sound like the thuds of an
elephant that can be easily heard up to 120 feet
away.

of Striding and Springing
**XP Value:** 2,500 **GP Value:** 20,000
DUNGEON MASTER Guide, 1st Edition
The wearer of these magical boots has a base
movement rate of 12, regardless of size or weight.
That speed can be maintained tirelessly for up to
12 hours per day, but thereafter the boots cease to
function for 12 hours—they need that long to
recharge.

In addition to the striding ability, these boots
allow the wearer to make great leaps. While nor-
mal paces for an individual wearing this type of
footgear are 3 feet long, the boots also enable for-
ward jumps of up to 30 feet, backward leaps of 9
feet, and vertical springs of 15 feet.

If circumstances permit the use of such move-
ment in combat, the wearer can effectively strike
and spring away whenever he or she has the ini-
tiative during a melee round. However, such
activity involves a degree of danger—there is a
base 20% chance that the wearer of the boots
stumbles and is stunned on the following round.
Adjust the 20% chance downward by 3% for each
point of Dexterity the wearer has above 12 (17%
at 13 Dexterity, 14% at 14, 11% at 15, 8% at 16,

event, the boots better Armor Class by | due to

of Tracks
**XP Value:** 1,500 **GP Value:** 7,500
The Book of Marvelous Magic

This useful pair of boots allows the wearer, on
command, to leave tracks like those of any crea-
ture (dragon, giant, ogre, or anything else) while
walking. The boots function as often and for as
long as desired.

of Traveling and Leaping
**XP Value:** 2,500 **GP Value:** 20,000

DUNGEON MASTER Guide, 1st Edition

These boots appear to be ordinary footgear. If
magic is detected, they radiate only a faint aura of
enchantment and alteration. When they are on the
owner’s feet and he or she concentrates on the
desire to fly, the boots sprout wings at the heel
and empower the wearer to fly, without having to
maintain the concentration.

The wearer can use the boots for up to two
hours per day, all at once or in several shorter
flights. If the wearer tries to use them for a longer
duration, the power of the boots fades rapidly, but
it doesn’t abruptly disappear—the wearer slowly
descends to the ground.

For every 12 hours of uninterrupted nonuse,
the boots regain one hour of flying power. How-
ever, no amount of nonuse allows the boots to be
used for more than two hours at a time. Some
winged boots are better than others. To determine
the quality of a given pair, roll 1d4 and consult

Brazen
**XP Value:** 9,000 **GP Value:** 45,000
STRATEGIC REVIEW Magazine 7

This item has the appearance of a highly-burnished,
brazen flask, shaped like a Klein bottle. The flask is
corked and the cork has a red seal impressed bear-
ing mystical runes, When uncorked, the symbols on
the seal may be used to compel 1d6 djinni or 1d2
efreet into the bottle, which is then corked. When
one creature is being compelled, the compulsion is
at +4 effectiveness, for two creatures the effective-
ness drops to +1, and more than two creatures have
normal saving throws.

The bottle may also be used to attempt to jug
one of the following—a balor (+3), invisible
stalker (+2), an air elemental (-1), a fire elemental
(-2), or a minor fiend (+1). If forcibly compelled
into the bottle, any of the above creatures (includ-
ing the djinni and efreet) are in very foul moods
when next uncorked (attacking with haste and
ferocity). When found in a dungeon, or elsewhere,
a bottle may already be occupied—at the DM’s
discretion. If a considerable time has elapsed since
the being was compelled into the jug (say 1,500
years or so), the being may be so glad for its new-
found freedom that it willingly serves the person
who freed it for 1001 days. In some cases (a balor
for instance), the liberated creature may attempt to
destroy everything in the immediate vicinity.

of Containment

**XP Value:** 4,000 **GP Value:** 20,000
The Book of Marvelous Magic
This small bottle can hold up to 20 units of any
fluid. A magic potion counts as one unit, as does
one gallon of any nonmagical fluid. The bottle
keeps all of its contents separate, and each may
be recalled by name. However, any fluid stored
must be poured from the bottle to be used. The
bottle appears empty. If broken, all its liquid con-
tents disappear.

Efreeti
**XP Value:** 9,000 **GP Value:** 45,000
DUNGEON MASTER Guide, 1st Edition
This bottle is typically fashioned of brass or bronze,
with a lead stopper bearing special seals. A thin

stream of smoke is often seen issuing from it. There
is a 10% chance that the effeeti is insane and attacks
immediately upon being released. There is also a
10% chance that the efreeti of the bottle grants only
three wishes. The other 80% of the time, however,
the inhabitant of the bottle will serve normally (see
the MONSTROUS MANUAL accessory). When opened,
the efreeti issues from the bottle.

In a DRAGONLANCE Campaign: Efreeti bottles
do not exist on Ansalon.

of Evaporation

**XP Value:** 500 **GP Value:** 1,500
The Book of Marvelous Magic
This bottle is identical to a bottle of containment
and usually functions in the same manner. How-
ever, its entire contents may disappear without
warning. There is a 5% chance of disappearance
any time the user attempts to remove a liquid
from the bottle.

Eversmoking

**XP Value:** 500 **GP Value:** 2,500
DUNGEON MASTER Guide, 1st Edition

This metal urn is identical to an efreeti bottle
except that it does nothing but smoke. The
amount of smoke is very great if the stopper is
pulled out, pouring from the bottle and totally
obscuring vision in a 50,000 cubic foot area, in
one round. Left unstoppered, the bottle fills
another 10,000 cubic feet of space with smoke
each round until 120,000 cubic feet of space is
fogged. The area remains smoked until the bottle
is stoppered. When the bottle is stoppered, smoke
dissipates normally, The bottle can be resealed
only if the command word is known.

In a DRAGONLANCE Campaign: Eversmoking
bottles do not exist on Ansalon.

of Fireflies
**XP Value:** 600 **GP Value:** 3,000
The Book of Marvelous Magic
This bottle appears and functions as a bottle of
containment. However, when a skin of wine is
poured into it, the bottle glows with many tiny
lights and the wine is immediately consumed.
The lights can be commanded to glow with any
brightness desired and can light an area as small
as 1-foot across or up to 120 feet in diameter. The
bottle cannot be totally darkened, except magi-
cally. The firefly light lasts one hour per skin of

wine, as often as desired.

The bottle of pleasant odors was developed to

of Preservation
**XP Value:** 200 **GP Value:** 2,000

DRAGON Magazine 194
While they look like normal glass bottles from
the outside, these common, magical devices are
invaluable to wizards who use them for storing
odds and ends. The bottles come in a variety of
sizes and shapes, but all share one property; their
interior walls project a spell designed to preserve
indefinitely the freshness of anything placed
within them, including spell components or
ingredients for the manufacture of potions and
other magical items. A more mundane use for a
large bottle of preservation would be the storage
of perishable food items, but the use of even a
common magical item to preserve inexpensive
food seems a bit wasteful.

Thought
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 5,000
Tome of Magic

This item usually takes the form of a metal flask
similar in appearance to an efreeti bottle. Bottle
and stopper are usually engraved with intricate
runes. The bottle can be used to store and protect
important memories and thoughts, and is often
used by powerful characters as a way of manag-
ing their (potentially cluttered) memories.

To use the bottle, a character concentrates on
the thought or memory to be stored. He or she
then uncorks the bottle and speaks the word of
command. The thought or memory is then trans-
ferred from the character’s brain into the bottle.
All details of the thought or memory are held
within the bottle. The caster remembers the gen-
eral nature of the thought (“Oh, that was my
thought on the design of an efreeti-powered
steam engine!”), but need not worry about forget-
ting specific details, since these are trapped in the
thought bottle.

To retrieve a thought, a character uncorks the
bottle and speaks another word of command. The
thought or memory is then transferred directly
into the user’s brain.

Thought bottles are sometimes used to protect
vital information. A messenger carrying vital
plans through enemy territory where there is a
significant chance of capture and subsequent
interrogation might carry all sensitive plans in
one or more bottles. The messenger does not
know the contents or the command word and
therefore cannot reveal the contents of the bottles.
Likewise, a spy could gain secret information,

transfer it to a thought bottle, then use forget or
630

 

200

X
modify memory to wipe the information from his
or her mind. After this, the spy is incapable of
revealing the sensitive information.

Thought bottles are sometimes used as “mem-
ory archives,” where characters can save memo-
ries that are “cluttering up” their minds. (This
would be more of a problem for long-lived races
such as elves, since the sheer volume of memo-
ries recorded over several centuries could be
overwhelming.)

Thought bottles function (both storage and
retrieval operations) for any intelligent creature.
When discovered, 75% of all thought bottles are
capable of holding only a single thought or
memory. The remaining 25% have a capacity of
2d4 separate thoughts or memories. There is a
separate word of command for each “thought
slot.”

In Ravenloft: It is possible for a self-willed
undead to place a thought in a bottle that reflects
the monster’s inner essence. Any mortal who
opens the bottle and speaks the command word
suddenly experiences the depths of evil of the
undead monster’s mind. This is cause for a mad-
ness check. Vampires and liches occasionally use
this magical item as a trap for unwary hunters.
Since they rarely lose any thoughts, these crea-
tures have no other use for the bottle.

Thuba’s Efreeti Bottle
**XP Value:** 12,000 **GP Value:** 60,000
1993 Collector Card 465
Thuba’s magical bottle contains not one but two
efreeti inside of it, a mated pair. Thuba is a partic-
ularly cruel and punishing master, and the efreeti
pair loathe him. However, he is wise and thor-
ough and has never slipped when issuing his
commands. The efreeti wait and plot for the day
they may gain their revenge upon Thuba. He,
however, knows very well their hatred for him
and has several surprises for them, should they

ever try to disobey.

of Trapping
**XP Value:** 3,500 **GP Value:** 17,500
DRAGON Magazine 194
These magical bottles look absolutely normal
when empty, except for their large, flaring
mouths, and the elaborate, hinged stoppers that
close them. The bottle’s magic is activated when
it is pointed at an object or person of less than
120 cubic feet in volume (which includes most

Bottle of Trapping

“Th panenmneenieinnnituenenntnnnietniniseeeneennineneennennemmele

 

 

humanoids 12 feet or less in height) and the lid is
opened. When this happens, a beam of multicolor
light lances out from the bottle’s mouth to strike
the target. If the target fails a saving throw vs.
spell, it shrinks to a size that lets it fit within the
bottle. (As if affected by a reduce spell cast by a
12th-level wizard; a 12-foot-tall creature would
shrink to 3 inches.) Then the target is sucked
toward the bottle’s mouth.

At that point most inanimate objects are irre-
sistibly sucked into the bottle, but living creatures
can attempt to grab the lip of the mouth and hold
on against the force of suction. To cling to the
edge of the mouth, they must succeed at a
Strength check on 1d20 each round that they wait
for rescue. The bottle can only hold one shrunken
object at a time, so if the target does end up in the
bottle, it is entirely empty. While the bottle’s
walls are as fragile as normal glass from the out-
side, they are stronger than steel from the inside,
foiling most attempts to escape.

There are two ways to exit the bottle. At the com-
mand of the holder, the bottle can expel its contents
the same way that it trapped them, shooting them
outward and subjecting them to an enlarge spell so
that they return to normal size within seconds of
escape, Someone may escape a bottle of trapping

when the bottle is destroyed, an easy task from the

prevents it from enlarging its contents, so that any-
one escaping from a shattered bottle of trapping
still stands just a few inches tall until a dispel magic
or enlarge spell is cast.

Solars use an enormous composite bow with a

The bow of accuracy is simple, but effective. The

Black
**XP Value:** 2,500 **GP Value:** 15,000
Black Courser

Whenever a character draws this bow, the target is
automatically hit—provided the target is visible
and within a range of one mile. The shot inflicts
maximum damage according to the type of arrow
fired, so this weapon is truly devastating if the
black quiver (see Quiver) is also found. Unfortu-
nately, every time the bow is drawn, it perma-
nently drains one point of Constitution (the PC
doesn’t realize this until after the first shot has
been fired).

The desert centaurs use several varieties of magi-
cal bows (typically +1 to +3). In addition to these,
the most powerful and valued is a gleaming,
white composite bow simply called the dow of the
centaurs. Despite its name, it can be used by any
tace. The bow enables the archer to shoot twice
the normal number of arrows and doubles the
effective range. The first arrow loosed from this
bow in a round strikes at +3 to attack and dam-
age, the second at +2, the third at +1. Subsequent
shots in a round have no modifiers.

Crossbow of Angling
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 7,000
The Complete Thief’s Handbook
This appears to be a normal light crossbow,
although it has a thick wrist strap attached that is
of an unusual design and toughness. On command,
it can fire bolts with special properties up to three
times per day. The magical bolt fired counts as a
bolt +2 for determination of attack rolls (and dam-
age if appropriate), When fired, this special bolt is
trailed by a pencil-thin, snaking line of faint blue
light (which radiates magic fairly strongly) that
connects it to the crossbow. When the bolt impacts,
the head expands into a small claw that embeds

itself in the target, such that the bolt grips it
strongly. By the use of a second command word,
the crossbow user can “reel in” the target, the thin
“cord” of magical energy shrinking to drag the tar-
get to the archer.

The speed at which the target is retrieved
depends on weight, friction, and distance—the
maximum speed is 60 feet per round. The DM may
need to exercise some judgement in these cases. If
the target is heavier than the archer or is immov-
able or braced in some way, then the crossbow
archer may actually be dragged to the target rather
than the reverse. This can be exploited, of course,
to pull a thief up to a ceiling or up a wall. The mag-
ical cord is AC -2 and takes 15 points of damage
(nonmagical weapons do no damage) to destroy.

ever, the weapon creates its own bolts. These
are treated as +0 magical bolts, but can hit any
target capable of being damaged at all by physi-
cal weapons (even those, for example, which
can only be hurt by +3 or blunt weapons). Bolts
disappear after hitting or missing. On each shot,
roll a d20 for the number of bolts fired, sub-
tracting 5. Results of 5 or less are treated as 0
(that is, there is a 25% chance the crossbow
fires nothing at all. Otherwise, it fires 1 to 15
bolts). The bolts spread out in an even cone, in a
forward direction; from a single bolt straight
ahead to 15 in a 90-degree cone. Therefore,
unless the target is very wide or very close, no
more than 1 or 2 bolts will strike a single target.

This magical bow offers no bonuses on attack

of being able to fire two arrows at the same
time. Whenever a nonmagical arrow is fired
from the bow, it automatically creates and fires
a second arrow. If the first arrow hits its target,
so does the second; if the first shot misses, the
second arrow has normal probabilities to hit.
All arrows shot from this bow, whether they hit
or not, are destroyed upon impact (or as soon
as it is determined that they did not hit) and
cannot be recovered.

When fired, this bow ignites any arrow it shoots. In
addition to regular damage, the arrow causes 1d6 hit
points of fire damage. Magical arrows must save vs.
magical fire if shot from this bow; if they fail the
save, they catch fire and lose all magical enchant-

arrows perform normally. These arrows ignite com-

Fire teeth bows can set fire to a maximum of

Gem

**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 7,000

DRraGOn Magazine 127
Created long ago by a prestigious halfling bowyer
and the Archmage Bendalyre, gem bows were
developed to help halfling societies combat their
enemies. Over the years, the gem bows have disap-
peared from halfling realms. They are now lost and
all but forgotten by the race that created them. All
are bows +1, of excellent craftsmanship, and have
the ability to gain additional powers.

On the face of each bow is an indentation above
the handgrip. If certain gemstones are set into this
notch, the bow is then capable of bestowing one of
three special powers on any arrow fired. Arrows
must be nonmagical to gain these powers.

A gem bow gains one charge per 200 gp value
of the gem. Gems set into a gem bow decrease in
value by 200 gp as each charge is used, eventually
becoming normal stones (or dust) with the expi-
ration of their charges. These bows function nor-
mally with respect to range and rate of fire.

This type of bow (self or composite) always has a
+3 bonus to hit targets. It acts as a normal magi-

number is rolled. Then, the arrow it fires strikes
directly at the target’s heart (if it has one), slaying
the victim instantly. Attack roll required are as

DRAGON Magazine 127
This bow, made of ivory and mithral steel, is
believed to have been first created by the Elder
Craftsmen of Niflheim (an area of the Gray
Waste). Duplicates of the ice fang bow have been
crafted by human and elf wizards ever since. The
main function of an ice fang bow is to create ice
arrows from water vapor in the air. The user need
only pull on the bowstring and release it; the
arrows are created instantly, but may only be

~ epee eee esas iaaecsmrres ea rrae

fired at a rate of two per round, to allow the bow
time to recharge.

These magical arrows are +1 on attack rolls
and cause double damage (2d6 hp damage for
normal flight arrows) vs. fire-using and fire-
dwelling creatures. If used against any other sort
of being, these arrows are merely +1 on attack
and damage. Each ice fang bow can generate a
total of 1d100+50 ice arrows before its magic
fades. A discharged and nonmagical ice fang bow
is still finely crafted and worth 1,000 gp.

Unfortunately, in hot climates (120°F+) the
effective range of these arrows is halved. In envi-
ronments where the temperature is over 300°F
(certain Inner and Outer Planes and the effected
area of a fireball spell), the ice arrows cannot
form. If normal or magical arrows are fired from
this bow, they do not gain the bonuses against
fiery creatures, and the bow performs in all ways
as a normal bow.

Potent and permanent, these i/lusory missile
launchers are bows, slings, or other missile weap-

ments by high-level illusionists. They can be used
as normal missile launchers with no bonuses, but
if the user merely prepares the weapon for firing,
without fitting a missile, an illusory missile of
whatever type is appropriate for the launcher, is
conjured up. When the owner “fires” the weapon,
the illusory missile travels to its target as noted
above, and any thinking enemy who believes the
illusion takes damage equal to that from a normal
missile (save vs. spell with Wisdom bonuses oth-
erwise), As with all illusions, these are useless
against unthinking opponents such as golems and
undead. As consolation, they give their users an
unlimited supply of “ammunition” against nor-
mal foes.

~ Iron Bow of Gesen

Iron Bow of Gesen
**GP Value:** —
The Horde Campaign Set
This item is very simple-looking. It is made
entirely from black iron, and is strung with a
golden wire. This item and the hammer of Gesen
were the weapons of Gesen Khan, a legendary
hero of the steppes. He claimed the magical items
by slaying a powerful manggus. From then on, he
fought many monsters, conquered rival tribes,
went on daring raids, and fought great battles. As
long as he had his bow and hammer, he was never
defeated. Finally, in his old age, he rode to the
lands of the west and was never seen again.

The bow and hammer may have reappeared sev-
eral times since his disappearance. It is hard to be
certain. Unscrupulous conmen and dishonest wiz-
ards have foisted both crude and cunning imita-
tions on the unwary. The Yeke-noyan of the Suren
was said to have had the bow and hammer when he
drove the Kao out of the endless Waste. Some even
say the weapons have now come into the hands of
the new warlord of the Tulgan, Yamun Khahan.

Although they look heavy and impossible to
use, both the bow and hammer are quite light.
The bow is the mightier and more valuable of the
two weapons. Although made of iron, it flexes
easily. Any arrow fired from it is automatically
considered magical for that attack, +5 to attack
and damage rolls. Arrows instantly appear in
hand when using the bow, so the owner never
needs to fear running out. All ranges for the iron
bow are double those for a normal short bow. In
addition, the iron bow can fire a 20 HD lightning
bolt three times a day. This has a range equal to
an arrow shot from the bow.

Characters possessing the club and bow invari-
able become chaotic good, although this occurs
over a period of time. Worse still, the character is
unable to refuse any challenge, adventure, or
heroic deed, no matter how dangerous or impossi-
ble. He or she will refuse aid from others on these
adventures. Should the character refuse to under-
take an adventure, the bow and hammer will
instantly disappear.

with a shimmering cord. Closer examination
reveals that the bow is of iron, cunningly wrought
to appear like wood, while the string is a golden
wire. The bow is light and can be drawn back
with ease, bending more than iron should allow.

The bow is one of the two great weapons of
Gesen Khan, a legendary chieftain among the
horse nomads. (The other weapon is the hammer
of Gesen.) Gesen was supposedly the first to
unite all the warring tribes.

One of Gesen’s treasures was the iron bow,
supposedly the first bow ever made. No ordinary
person, it is said, could bend it, and none could
withstand the fearsome arrows loosed from its
string. A single shaft from it could sunder a tree
or shatter stone. Furthermore, since it was the
first bow, it was the greatest and wisest of all
bows. No one who touched it shot poorly after
that.

Eventually Gesen died and was buried some-
where on the steppes. It is said that the bow was
interred with him, but since that time, many
claim to have seen or used it, The iron bow is an
excellent artifact for use by a warrior, especially
if the adventure pits the party against some
tremendous foe. Because of its seemingly normal
appearance, characters will have to be wary of
fraudulent copies.

Other warriors covet the artifact, and the group
will be besieged by claimants based on ancestry,
great need, and fitness. Most try to take the bow
by force. The characters will find themselves in
situations not unlike the notorious gunslingers
who had always to face new challengers.

Constant Powers: Any arrow shot from the
bow is temporarily transformed into an arrow +5,
providing attack and damage bonuses. Arrows
leap from the quiver to the string of their own
accord, allowing up to four shots per round. The
bow has twice the range of a normal short bow.

Invoked Powers: Three times per day, the
owner can fire an arrow as a lightning bolt or
flame arrow spell (cast at 20th level). Once per
day the owner can use any arrow of slaying.

Curse: Users of the bow risk artifact transfor-
mation. Should this occur, the character gradually
changes in features and knowledge into a wild
horseman of the steppes. The character may for-
get how to read or sail, instead becoming an
expert rider. The transformation does not affect
class abilities. Once it is complete, the character
is subject to artifact possession, unable to resist

any adventure or good cause.
Suggested Means of Destruction:

* It must be returned to the vengeful shade of
Gesen, who is wandering the steppes.

* It must be flattened with 1,000 blows from
the hammer of Gesen.

The avatar uses a Jong bow +5 with quadruple
normal ranges, and can create two arrows of slay-

ing each day (any type).

of Speed
**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 12,000
DRAGON Magazine 127

This weapon is +1 on attack and damage rolls. If
there are undamaged and nonmagical arrows
within 10 feet of the bow, those arrows are tele-
ported, nocked, and ready to fire, as soon as the
archer pulls back the string. This allows the normal
rate of-fire for the archer to be doubled. Some 10%
of these bows are able to teleport any arrow within
10 feet, magical or not, to the bow for firing. The
archer can only distinguish one arrow from another
if the arrows are distinctive. If the arrows are basi-
cally identical, they are chosen at random.

Underwater Crossbow
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 10,000
Port of Raven’s Bluff
These function as regular weapons on the surface,
but they also work underwater with the same
ranges as their surface counterparts. They do not
require special bolts.

of the Unicorn
**XP Value:** 2,750 **GP Value:** 18,000
DRAGON Magazine 139

The bow of the unicorn performs normally as a
long bow +3 unless the archer (who must be of
chaotic good alignment) commands otherwise. If
the user chooses, an arrow shot from the bow
becomes an arrow of slaying that affects anyone
who has harmed or slain a unicorn. The archer
can also command the arrows fired from the bow
to cause a living target to fall asleep when hit (as
the wizard spell sleep, doing no damage) or to
stop the target (as the wizard spell hold person,
again doing no damage) for 20 rounds. The bow
itself causes the effects, and any arrows fired
from it are briefly enchanted.

Ten percent of the bows of heartseeking are
enchanted to be useful against vampires. These
bows can fire wooden arrows into a vampire’s
heart and slay it on the spot. Any score of 20 or
better, including all bonuses, means that the bow
of vampire slaying has killed its vampiric target.
No other beings are so affected by this bow.

of Warning
**XP Value** **GP Value**
With Curse: — 1,500
Without Curse: 500 10,500
DRAGON Magazine 127

At first, this bow appears to be a bow +3, but
when an arrow is fired at living targets of evil
alignment, it always misses. Furthermore, the
arrow’s flight always alerts an evil victim and
instantly directs his or her attention to the loca-
tion of the user of the bow, negating all further
surprise advantages. If the nature of this bow is
discovered, the curse can be removed by magical
means, such as dispel magic, wish, or limited
wish spells, or by priestal means, such as a
remove curse spell. The curse is considered to be
12th-level magic. Once the curse is removed, the
bow becomes a bow +3.

Bowl
Bowls are used to hold soups and stews. They can
be crafted from wood, metal, ceramic, or even a
soft stone such as pumice. Magical bowls are gen-
erally used to summon or command water elemen-
tals, or they are used to control, create, or divine
through a magical fluid in the bowl’s depths.

The Magister
This bowl resembles any other magical bow] save
that it fills with blood either once per day (24
hours), upon command, or of its own volition
once every four rounds after being activated.

While in the bowl, blood will not congeal, and

medical supply (it will be compatible with all to
whom it is given), stirge lure, or hurled at oppo-
nents to blind them temporarily in a fight, et
cetera. Eighty percent of these bowls contain
human blood. Others contain elvish, gnome, and
even (most rare) dragons’ blood. Such bowls fill
9d10 times, and then vanish.

Calabash of Plenty

food and drink the owner desires, twice per day.

of Commanding Water Elementals

**XP Value:** 4,000 **GP Value:** 25,000

DUNGEON MASTER Guide, 1st Edition

This large container is usually fashioned from
blue or green semiprecious stone (malachite or
lapis lazuli, for example, sometimes jade). It is
about 1-foot in diameter, half that deep, and rela-
tively fragile. When the bowl is filled with fresh
or salt water and certain words are spoken, a
water elemental of 12 Hit Dice appears. The sum-
moning words require one round to speak.

Note that if salt water is used, the elemental is
stronger (+2 per Hit Die, maximum 8 hp per die,
however). Information about water elementals
can be found in the MONSTROUS MANUAL acces-
sory. (See also Bowl of Watery Death.)

In Ravenloft: An elemental cannot return to
its native plane unless it finds a normal escape
route from Ravenloft. If an elemental is freed
somehow from control, it attacks the character
who summoned it.

of Delicacies

**GP Value:** 3,000
DRAGON Magazine 73
A small, covered, dark-crystal bowl, rather like a
sugar bowl. When the user places both hands on
the covered vessel, and speaks the name of a deli-
cacy (for example, “caviar”), the bowl fills with
one ounce of the named delicacy. The magic may
be used 10 times a week, for the same or different
items. Only delicacies “implanted” in the bowl
may be produced. Such bowls usually are
implanted with 1d6 delicacies; a particular one
might produce caviar, frog’s legs, fried ants,
gooseberry jam, and port salut cheese.

Bowl of Watery Death

Orel

of Ship Sinking
**XP Value:** 4,000 **GP Value:** 25,000

IMAGINE Magazine 19
This bowl, when filled with crystal clear water,
allows the owner to command the most powerful
kind of 16 HD water elemental. (Unlike the stan-
dard bowl of commanding water elementals). It was
created by a mighty wizard in a city-port beset by
pirates, and given to the ruler. However, the elemen-
tal princess Olhydra was instrumental in causing a
geas to be placed on the bowl, she being anxious to
preserve the status quo. Anyone commanding an
elemental to his or her service would unleash it onto
the first three ships sighted, before any free choice
could be made. The geas was revealed (in most
tragic circumstances) when the bow] was first used.

The manufacture of this a bow! of ship sinking
requires the casting of enchant an item, conjure
elemental, and permanency. The geas in this case
was placed on the item during the fabricating
process by another, something that can easily
happen unless precautions are taken.

Each time the bow] is used, the ship being inflicted
with the bowl’s effect, must roll a saving throw vs.
lightning or sink (refer to item saving throws given in
the DMG). If the saving throw is successful, the crew
is able to react quickly enough to position the ship in
such a way that it does not capsize.

of Watery Death
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** 1,000
DUNGEON MASTER Guide, 1st Edition

This device looks exactly like a bow! command-
ing water elementals, right down to the color,
design, magical radiation, and other details. How-
ever, when it is filled with water, the wizard must
successfully save vs. spell or shrink to the size of
a small ant and be plunged into the center of the
bowl. If salt water is poured into the bowl, the
saving throw suffers a -2 penalty.

The victim drowns in 1d6+2 rounds unless
magic is used to save the character, the wizard can-
not be physically removed from the bow! of watery
death except by magical means—animal growth,
enlarge, or wish are the only spells that will free
the victim and restore normal size. A potion of
growth poured into the water has the same effect, a
sweet water potion grants the victim another sav-
ing throw (a chance that the curse magic of the
bowl works only briefly). If the victim drowns,
death is permanent, no resurrection is possible,

and even a wish cannot save the victim.

Bringer of Doom

Box

Boxes can be constructed of solid wood, metal,
wooden slats, paper-board, paper, and, on occa-
sion, mysterious substances that resemble stone
or rock. Magical boxes can be used to entrap
creatures both vile and good. Overall, however,
boxes have a multitude of possible functions
making them fairly safe items to find.

Bringer of Doom

**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** —
Outer Planes MC Appendix
So long in the past is the Age of Doom that it can-
not even be conceived of by mortals. This was a
time of great lamenting, for the society of that
lived in that age was destroyed in the twinkling of
an eye. Their own powerful magic and exalted
sciences became too great for them, and their
passions overcame their senses. In a great wave
of power, the race destroyed itself, leaving but
one remnant.

Perhaps it would have been better had they left
nothing behind, but the artifact known as the
bringer of doom somehow survived that great
holocaust. The bringer of doom is a small box
with a strange, circular red gem set upon its top.
If the gem is touched and depressed, the box itself
explodes in a blinding flash of power and destruc-
tion. So great is the force of the blast that every-
thing within 100 feet of the item (including the
user and the box) is utterly destroyed.

The explosion opens a temporary, one-way rift
to the Gray Waste, from which 10 to 1,000
hordlings pour forth and rain destruction down
upon everything they encounter. There is a 10%
chance that some other, greater fiend will come
through the rift, as well.

The bringer of doom always reforms, after
destruction, and manages to be discovered at a
later time, by the unknowing.

Burglar Detection
**XP Value:** 800 **GP Value:** 4,000
DRAGON Magazine 73
A nondescript small box. For approximately eight
hours after a button on the side is pushed, this
item is set to make a cacophony of noises similar
to the approach of a large group of people when,
and only when, a person comes within 5 feet of it.
It is commonly used to scare off burglars.

"apelin paca ianamaicnime

Dead
**XP Value:** 300 **GP Value:** 3,000
Lost Ships
This term refers to a stone box constructed of
atharstone, a rock found in many asteroids and a
few mountain ranges on some planets. The sides
of the dead box are made of solid slabs of the
stone, sealed with natural rubber mixed with gor-
gon’s blood.

A properly constructed dead box completely
and utterly foils any means (magical or natural)
of detecting the presence of any magic, residual
dweomer, alignment aura, or heat differential
within the box, when such detection is attempted
from outside the box. Dead boxes may be of any
size (from small rooms to tiny coffers), but all are
very heavy—atharstone is heavier and more
durable than lead.

To work, a dead box must be “airtight.” It is
rumored that the name of the box comes not only
from the magically dead properties of such boxes,
but from the fate of a wizard or other fool who
tried to hide in one to escape detection.

of Delightful Transports

**XP Value:** 2,500 **GP Value:** 25,000
The Complete Thief’s Handbook
These wooden boxes are 6-inch cubes, and come
in identical pairs (often decorated with great
attention to detail). When a nonliving object of
suitable size is placed inside, the lid closed and a
command word spoken, the object disappears,
only to reappear (effectively teleported) in the
matching box. This function operates up to three
times per day.

While boxes of delightful transports are obvi-
ously very useful, they have certain limitations. It
is not possible for the object teleported to cross
any planar barriers. And, while the distance
between the boxes has no affect on the teleporta-
tion range, there is always a 5% chance that the
object dispatched does not reach its destination,
instead appearing at some random location 10d10
miles away. Thus, transmission of valuables is not
recommended. The boxes are more often used to
send messages, which can always be sent in
duplicate (this method results in a high probabil-
ity for at least one successful dispatch).

The major limitation on use of these boxes,
though, is that no enchanted object can be fele-
ported using them. Even the placing of a simple

Nystul’s magic aura spell on an object prevents its
699

being teleported using these boxes. Therefore,
magical items such as rings, potions, amulets,
and other such things, small enough to fit into
one of these boxes, cannot be teleported to distant
locations.

Dido’s Flatbox
**XP Value:** 5,500 **GP Value:** 22,500
1992 Fantasy Collector Card 510

Dido’s flatbox is set with an obsidian chip on its
lid that is very hard to see. The chip has been
imbued with an antimagic shell with a radius of 5
feet. Because of the chip, Dido can carry his flat-
box in a bag of holding or magically teleport
without it exploding. However, the box is not pro-
tected against psionic extradimensional travel.
Since most of Dido’s rivals are psionicists, he
feels fairly safe with his storage container. Exter-
nally, the flatbox is 3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet, but
its interior is about 6 feet deep.

Face of Xenous .

**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** —
Treasures of GREYHAWK.

From the outside, this exquisitely carved, rose-
wood box with copper trim is a thing of beauty—
inside is a thing of terror; the living face of the
evil, mad Archmage Xenous Zenpor. Unwilling
to die or become undead, she made a deal with
the evil god, Nerull, the Reaper. Using two sepa-
rate wishes, Zenpor wished—to be able to live
long enough to see the enslavement of Oerth and,
that her face would always remain beautiful.

The wicked Nerull granted her requests. The
god ripped away Zenpor’s face and placed it in a
specially created box. She has slowly gone mad
over the years following the granting of her
wishes.

Although she has lost her spell abilities,
Xenous is still a formidable opponent. When the
lid of the box is opened, she can use any of the
arcane abilities granted to her by Nerull. A
nonevil creature that touches the box takes 4d6

points of damage and ages 14 years. Xenous can-

open the box using telekinesis, but cannot teleki-
netically move herself.

Primary Power: Summon one of each type of
elemental. 16 HD, no control needed, once a
week.

Major Benign Powers: Cone of cold (10 dice,
twice per day), flesh to stone (once per day), and
telekinetic gaze (1,000 pounds, twice a day).

Tome of Magic
A practical example of hypergeometry and hyper-
mathematics, the flatbox appears to be a wooden
box about 3 feet long, 2 feet wide, and 2 inches
deep. It weighs eight pounds. The top of the box
is a hinged lid.

When the lid is opened, the interior of the box
is filled with impenetrable darkness. The dark-
ness cannot be dispelled by any form of magic; it
is a characteristic of the hypergeometrical topog-
raphy of the box.

Viewed from the outside, the flatbox appears to
be only 2 inches deep, it actually has the internal
volume of a box 6 feet deep. (Thus, it has a vol-
ume of 36 cubic feet.) The maximum weight that
can be loaded into a flatbox is 500 pounds. No
matter how much of its volume is filled, the flat-
box still weighs only eight pounds.

Since the inside of the box is completely dark,
the only way to retrieve a specific item is to feel
around within the box. Finding an object this way
takes 1d4 rounds.

There is a significant danger associated with the

flatbox. If it is taken into an extradimensional
space (such as a portable hole), if it is teleported,
gated, or transported via dimensional folding or
any analogous method, or if it ever suffers 15
points of damage, the flatbox explodes violently.
The explosion destroys all contents of the box and
inflicts 4d10 points of damage on any creature
within 20 feet (save vs. spell for half damage).

of Heating
**XP Value:** 1,200 **GP Value:** 6,000
DRAGON Magazine 73

This is a box of gears and cogs, with a crank handle
protruding from one side. When the crank is turned,
heat emanates from the top of the box, more heat as
the crank is turned faster. Through magical means,
the energy of motion of the crank is magnified and
turned into heat sufficient (with steady cranking) to
heat a medium-sized room in winter.

Ice
**XP Value:** 800 **GP Value:** 4,000
The Complete Ranger’s Handbook

This is an airtight box 1-foot-square, made of
black metal with a single hinged panel. Opening
the panel reveals the hollow interior. Centered on
the outside of the panel is a white metal pointer
resembling a small arrow. The pointer can be
rotated in any direction to regulate the tempera-
ture inside the box. If pointed straight up (toward
the hinges), the temperature remains at 70°F. For
every complete clockwise rotation of the arrow,
the temperature inside the box drops one degree.
Therefore, if the arrow is rotated 30 times, the
temperature drops to 40°F. Rotating the arrow
counterclockwise raises the temperature 1 degree
per rotation. The temperature can’t be lowered
below 0° or elevated beyond 70°. The box is use-
ful for making ice and preventing food spoilage.

DRAGON Magazine 45

A box of many holdings is a cubical, oaken chest.
Each face of the chest may be decorated with
ornate carvings of a similar nature (75%) or with-
out any artwork at all (25%). There does not
appear to be any obvious lid to the chest. A detect
magic spell will reveal that magic is emanating
from the direction of the chest. Each side of the
box of many holdings can be treated as a “lid” to
the chest; each side may be opened to display a
compartment the size of the chest itself. (Note
that while one side of the chest is opened, the
remaining five become locked and no amount of
prying or “thieving” abilities can open any of
them). Each side is opened by the same method—
a small hole on each side holds a small peg or rod
that must be provided by the character. This trips
a latch allowing the side to swing back on hinges,
much the same as a normal chest lid.

Each compartment thus revealed is capable of
holding its own contents, not to exceed the vol-
ume of the box itself. This enables the owner of
the chest to store six times the volume that would
normally be expected from a chest of similar size
(in a box of many holdings with the dimensions of
2 cubic feet, 48 cubic feet of material could be
stored instead of just the expected 8). The weight
of a fully loaded chest is equal to the weight of
the chest itself plus the weight of the contents of
the heaviest compartment.

As with many magical treasures, 15% of the
extant boxes of many holdings are not without
their drawbacks. One side of the chest, chosen
randomly by the Dungeon Master, issues a ran-
dom curse when opened. Treasure may be
stored in this space with no ill effect on the
treasure itself, but each time the side is opened,
a new curse, randomly chosen by the DM, takes
effect on the opener. (Among magical scholars,
it is not known whether the curse is inherent in
the creation of the box or if it was purposely
placed there by the ancient wizard who created
these boxes). A remove curse removes the curse
upon the next opening only, but not subsequent
openings.

If the box is destroyed, (saving throw applicable
as for hardwood with magical bonuses), it will do
one point of damage for each inch along one of its
sides to all within a radius of 10 feet (if the box is 2
feet on all sides, it will do 24 points of damage to
those within 10 feet of it). There is no saving throw
for this damage. In addition, all objects or creatures
inside it disappear upon the chest’s destruction.

Two to five (1d4+1) of these 17- by 5-inch boxes

a small swinging door. Every box is marked with
a simple but unique symbol, found only on that
specific box. Boxes may be placed in a stationary
location anywhere in the world with a small pack-
age or message inserted through the swinging
door. When the handle is pulled and concentra-
tion is centered on the symbol of another box, the
message or package disappears from the original
box. It then reappears in the box selected within
1d4 days. The red handle on the outside of the
box moves to the downward position and locks
there whenever a message or package is received,
until the item is removed.

Roughly three dozen of these items are believed
to exist, and all of them look the same—a warm-
to-the-touch box made of dull gray metal that is 3
inches wide, 3 inches high, and 12 inches long.
There is one slot on the top of the box, and one on
the bottom; each is large enough to manage a siz-
able coin. Anyone who looks into a slot sees only
a blob of moving, molten metal.

Near the slot on the top are buttons made of
different metals—copper, silver, bronze, elec-
trum, gold, and platinum.

The box is used to convert coins to different
currencies of the same value. For example, if a
gold coin is put in the slot and the silver button is
pressed, 10 silver pieces are released. Pressing
the copper button releases 200 copper pieces,
Pressing the gold button releases a gold coin of a
different minting—a gold danter might become a
gold bicenta.

' The box cannot be used to create coins of
greater value. Only exact conversions are made.

Ohm’s Black
**XP Value:** 1,250 **GP Value:** 12,500
POLYHEDRON Newszine 82
Created by the famed wizard-naturalist Ohm, the
box is a perfect 12-inch cube with a dull black
finish. It weighs only one pound, and its surface
is smooth with no apparent openings.

The box was designed to carry creatures as
large as 10 feet tall, as heavy as 2,000 pounds.
The box is aware of the creature’s needs and pro-
vides a habitable environment for up to five days.
For example, the box provides a soft bed and a
lounge (complete with a seven course meal) for a
pampered halfling, or a salt water pool with fresh
fish for a kuo-toa. A creature left in the box for
longer than five days is automatically released.
Only one creature can be kept in the box at any
one time.

The box’s inhabitant is oblivious to the outside
world; dropping or rapping on the box is unno-
ticed by those inside. However, destroying the
box will dispel the magic and release the occu-
pant. Creatures inside the box can escape only by
means of a wish, or limited wish. All forms of
teleportation and interplanar travel are nullified
inside the box. However, magic resistant crea-
tures can check their magical resistance once
each time the box is used against them. If the roll
fails, the creature can be trapped for five days,
just as any other creature. Creatures trapped in
the box cannot be detected by any form of scry-
ing or divination except for contact other plane
or commune spells, which work normally with
respect to the trapped creature. Trapped creatures
cannot communicate with the outside word via
telepathy or other psionic abilities.

To trap a creature in the box, the owner must
place the box within 10 feet of the it and speak the
command word. The creature is transported into
the box in a blinding flash. If more than one crea-
ture, including the box’s owner, is within 10 feet of

of weight it can hold. Its only limitation is its
size. All items placed in the box must be inani-
mate or dead. If a living creature is placed in the
box, the creature is in a state of suspended anima-
tion until removed. When removed, the creature
must roll a system shock roll. If the roll fails, the
creature dies.

Strongbox of Immobility
**XP Value:** 300 **GP Value:** 3,000
DRAGON Magazine 73
A strongly constructed metal box (size can vary)
with a key. When the user utters the word of com-
mand (“heel”), the box stays exactly where it is
presently located, even if the user lets go. It is
anchored to the ether, and any force strong enough
to move it inevitably destroys it in the process.

A small box, often with a jeweled hand carved
on the lid. Each time it is opened, all within a
12-foot radius must roll a saving throw vs.
spell. Each creature that fails receives the
effect of four simultaneous charges from a staff
of withering, each creature that succeeds
receives two charges. Dragons are unaffected
by the box. After 1d20 times being opened, the
box disintegrates.

Bracelet

Bracelets are ornamental chains or straps that are
worn on the wrist. Made of almost any conceiv-
able material, bracelets can be adorned with etch-
ings, gems or other precious stones, or metallic
inlays. Like rings and other enchanted jewelry,
magical bracelets have no limitations on what
kind of magic they can hold. Only one magical
bracelet can be worn on any one arm, to a maxi-
mum of two bracelets (for creatures with more
than two arms). If more than two are worn by the
same creature, all magical bracelets cease to
function.

of Charms

**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 10,000
The Complete Fighter’s Handbook
This appears to be a nicely crafted bracelet of
sturdy gold links. It looks like any other bracelet
to which small charms and mementos are
attached. But when a warrior (only a warrior,
multiclass warrior, or dualclass warrior) slides
the bracelet around the blade or haft of a weapon,
and speaks the command word engraved on the
bracelet’s clasp, the weapon disappears, and a
gold charm matching the weapon appears on the
bracelet.

Thereafter, when the warrior speaks the com-
mand word and the name of the weapon, the
weapon magically appears in the hand on whose
wrist the bracelet rested, and the bracelet disap-
pears.

The bracelet can hold up to four weapon
charms this way. They can be normal or magical.
Shields and miscellaneous equipment cannot be
held on the bracelet—only weapons. Siege weap-
ons cannot be held.

The change from bracelet to weapon takes no

time at all, but this can only be done once per
716

 

216

X
turn. The bracelet itself can be used just eight
times in a day; turning the bracelet into a weapon
counts as one use, and turning the weapon back
into a bracelet counts as one use.

If the weapon held in the bracelet’s enchant-
ment is called on and used, then disarmed, the
character cannot call on another weapon from the
bracelet, The bracelet itself is within the weapon.
The character must retrieve the weapon first, and
only then can its magic be used.

A weapon can be taken out of the bracelet’s
array. When a character wishes to do this, he or
she takes the bracelet of the wrist and speaks the
name of the weapon, and then says the command
word—a reversal of the previous procedure.

The bracelet does not magically know its
owner. Anyone who steals the bracelet from its
owner and discovers what it is may use it and call
the previous owner’s weapons forth.

This item is best used when the wielder wants
to carry a variety of different weapons, and wants
to do so secretly. With a single warrior, the weap-
ons might be a long bow and quiver (quivers
count as part of the weapon they carry arrows
for), a bastard sword, a halberd, and a dagger.
This gives the warrior the ability to call forth the
weapon best suited to the task at hand. Ifa
weapon is broken, the bracelet isn’t; the user
needs to call forth the bracelet, then separate the
broken weapon from it.

Quivers are not magically replenished when
they are the size of charms. Whatever number of
arrows are in the quiver when it becomes a charm
are still in it when it becomes a quiver again.
Likewise, a broken bowstring stays broken.

The bracelet of charms may not be used on the
same weapon as a set of rings of readiness.

Dalamar’s
**XP Value:** 7,000 **GP Value:** 35,000
Tales of the Lance
The true name of this ancient artifact is lost to
time, it received its current (and misleading)
name when Dalamar took it from its resting place
in the Tower of High Sorcery and presented it to

“ Equus Bracelet __

Tanis. Dalamar did this to offer Tanis some small
protection against the magic of the death knight,
Lord Soth.

The bracelet contains an evil taint that prevents
those of lawful or chaotic good alignments from
using it. If those folk touch the bracelet, they are
struck by lightning that arcs from the artifact,
causing 3d10 points of damage. Any character
class may wear the bracelet, though it provides
limited protection against magic. It offers 10%
magic resistance against spells of 3rd to Sth level,
20% against those of 6th to 7th level, and 30%
against those of 8th to 9th level. The wearer can,
using a command word, call up magic resistance
three times a day for each of the three spell
ranges, The command word must be uttered just
as the opponent casts the spell.

Sadly, this benefit comes at a cost. The evil
taint of the bracelet causes the user’s alignment to
slowly slide toward chaotic evil. Every nine uses
(equivalent to a full day’s use of the magic resis-
tance) cause the character to slip one alignment.
From the top, the progression is as follows: law-
ful good, neutral good, chaotic good, lawful neu-
tral, neutral, chaotic neutral, lawful evil, neutral
evil, chaotic evil. The DM should keep track of
the number of uses of the bracelet and, after each
nine, slip the player a note showing his or her new
alignment. The PCs will soon discover the cause
of this shift.

Equus
**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 8,000
DUNGEON Magazine 22
An equus is a magical piece of jewelry that, upon
command, polymorphs into some form of a beast
of burden. The word “equus” (plural “equi”)
comes from an ancient language and has no lit-
eral translation in the common tongue. The clos-
est translation is “beast of burden” or “horse,” but
the word can be applied to anything that is used
like a horse. Thus, an actual horse, mule, worg,
camel, dog-sled team, nightmare, or any other
creature that can be ridden, used to pull a load, or
carry goods can be termed an equus. Equi come
in many different varieties, with the most com-
mon listed below. While 80% of equi are either
good or neutrally aligned, 20% polymorph into
evil creatures like nightmares, worgs, and giant
spiders. It is said that the death knight Shan
Nikkoleth once possessed an equus that polymor-

phed into gorgon form.
719

 

217

Si
Equi bracelets are invariably made of silver,
one side engraved with the image of the creature
it becomes, the reverse side etched with the com-
mand word.

Creature List

The DM may choose the form of the creature into
which the equus polymorphs from the following
table. The bracelet form polymorphs into one
type of creature only. A DM who prefers to roll
randomly should add the roll of 1d8 to that of
id12 and consult the table below. The DM should
use only a creature he or she feels comfortable
with and is sure will not give the PC an unfair
advantage in the campaign. Types of creatures
can be added to or deleted from the list as the DM
sees fit. Any of the following creatures that do
not appear on Table 49 in the PHB should be
considered equal to a heavy horse in movement
rate and encumbrance.

If the eguus is slain (reduced to 0 hit points or
less) in creature form, the creature immediately
reverts to bracelet form and cannot change into
creature form again. Damage to the creature form
of the equus can be healed magically by cure
wounds spells. If the creature is allowed food and
rest, it heals naturally at the rate of 1 hit point per
day. However, the equus can neither heal itself
nor be healed while in bracelet form.

Ivy

**XP Value:** 1,500 **GP Value:** 7,500

DRAGON Magazine 5
A fragile band of enchanted, forest ivy, the ivy
bracelet is created only in forest havens of druids
or sylvan creatures. It imparts to its wearer the
power of plant control (as the potion) until it is
removed. It also enables one to speak with piants,
as the priest spell. Any hand-to-hand combat can
destroy this delicate item, unless it saves vs.
crushing blow (as bone or ivory).

Medegian Bracelet of Lost Ships
**XP Value:** 1,500 **GP Value:** 15,000
GREYHAWK Adventures
This silver disk contains a zircon stone that was
enchanted by a greedy wizard who used it to
attain great wealth before he was captured and

hung by pirates.

The stone in the bracelet glows red on the side
that faces the nearest sunken ship within 1 mile.
When the gem enters within 50 feet of the hori-
zontal (not vertical) distance from a sunken ship,
the stone glows blue. When the command word is
spoken, the bracelet causes the sunken ship to
rise to the surface for two turns.

The bracelet has up to 25 charges and cannot
be recharged. The detection ability drains no
charges, but raising a sunken ship drains a num-
ber of charges depending on size.

For each sunken vessel discovered, there is a
25% chance that 1d6 other lost ships lie in the
same area. Only one ship can be raised at a time.
Each vessel has a 75% chance of being inhabited
by a random monster. Lost ships tend to consist
mostly of rotting wood covered with seaweed.
Each character who boards a raised ship has a

20% chance per turn of taking 1d6 damage from
falling through unstable floorboards (optional
Dexterity check to avoid damage). Note also that
a ship broken into several fragments may require
several separate charges, and that a badly shat-
tered ship may not be recoverable.

of Scaly Command

**XP Value:** 2,500 **GP Value:** 25,000
The Complete Wizard’s Handbook
This coral bracelet enables the wearer to control
water dwelling creatures with animal intelligence
or lower (mainly fishes and reptiles). The crea-
tures must be within a half-mile radius of the
caster in order to be controlled, and they must be
within 30 feet of each other. The number of crea-
tures that can be affected is a function of Hit
Dice. The spell affects 1d10 Hit Dice of mon-
sters. Monsters with 5+3 Hit Dice or more are
unaffected.

The center of the area of effect is determined
by the spellcaster. The creatures with the fewest
Hit Dice are affected first, and partial effects are
ignored. The caster does not have to be in the
water to command the creatures. The control lasts
for 2d6 turns and cannot be dispelled. No saving
throw is allowed against the magic of the bracelet.
The wearer can use this ability once per week.

The Land Beyond the Magic Mirror
This bracelet is lined with semiprecious stones. If
the stones are examined, it can be seen that the
large ones are merely star quartz, though of an
unusual blue-violet color that shades toward sil-
ver in the light. Each of these stones contains a
wish, but the only way to learn of this property is
to actually make a wish. Detection magic does
not reveal the nature of this bracelet and its
stones. The bracelet has 1d6 of these wish quartz
stones.

Bracer
Bracers are thick bands of metal or leather that
are strapped, belted, or tied to a character’s fore-
arm. Generally, the magic that is instilled in brac-
ers is good only during combat, since most
bracers help protect the wearer from injury, or
improve chances to strike at an opponent. Excep-
tions do exist, however, and more are found each

day.

Bracers of Archery

of Archery
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 10,000
DUNGEON MAasTER Guide, 1st Edition

These magical wrist bands are indistinguishable
from normal, nonmagical protective gear. When
worn by a character or creature able to employ a
bow, they enable the wearer to excel at archery.

The bracers empower a wearer to use any bow
(not including crossbows) as if he or she were
proficient in its usage, if this is not the case. If the
wearer of the bracers has proficiency with any
type of bow, he or she gains a +2 bonus to attack
rolls and a +1 bonus to damage whenever that
type of bow is used. These bonuses are cumula-
tive with any others, including those already
bestowed by a magical bow or magical arrows,
except for a bonus due to weapon specialization.

of Attraction

**GP Value:** 1,000
DRAGON Magazine 91
These arm guards appear to be normal bracers,
although they radiate magic, and are revealed as
bracers of defense (AC 2) if an identification
attempt is made. Any character who puts them
on, however, will find his or her wrists drawn
together irresistibly, until the bracers of attraction
are stuck to each other. Under such a condition, it
is impossible to successfully cast a spell that has
a somatic component; any attempt to do so will
simply result in the spell being wasted. Fighting
can be done, but with some difficulty—the
wearer suffers a -2 penalty on all attack and dam-
age rolls for as long as the bracers are stuck
together.

The bracers can be separated if the wearer
makes a successful bend bars roll, and they
remain apart for 1d4 rounds after that. Whether
the bend bars attempt succeeds or not, another
such roll cannot be made until one turn has
passed, When they are stuck together, the bracers
can be removed by any other character with a
Strength of 18 or greater. To remove them, either
the wearer or another character needs a Strength
of at least 16.

If the bracers of attraction are not removed
physically, they can only be taken off after a
priest of at least 10th level casts remove curse, or
by a limited wish, alter reality, or wish spell. The
bracers retain their cursed nature even after
removal (physically or magically), and provide no
AC benefit.

POLYHEDRON Newszine 82

These magical bracers can be activated if the
wearer has a Strength of at least 14. The wearer
slams the bracers together and yells the command
word, creating a cone of sound that is 120 feet
long, 2 feet wide at the base, and 30 feet at the
wide end. All creatures within the cone must save
vs. spell. If the save is successful, the creatures
are stunned for one round and deafened for two.
Those who fail the saving throw sustain 1d10
points of damage, are stunned for two rounds,
and deafened for one turn.

If the bracers are quickly slammed together
twice, a wave of ultrasonic sound, 1-foot wide and
100 feet long is created. The sound weakens materi-
als such as metal, stone, and wood. These objects
must save vs. disintegration with a +4 bonus or be
destroyed. Magical items are immune to the attack.
If the bracers are used more than once a day, there is
a 10% cumulative chance per use that they explode
and inflict 4d10 points of damage to the user.

of the Blinding Strike
**XP Value:** 4,000 **GP Value:** 20,000
The Rogues Gallery

These bracers look exactly like most magical
bracers. If worn by nonwarriors, they simply act
as bracers of defence, AC 4. However, they have
two special powers that reveal themselves when
worn by fighters. First, the bracers allow the user
to add +1 to his or her initiative rolls whenever
they are worn. Second, on mental command, the
bracers double the number of strikes the wearer is
allowed for a particular round. The fighter may
only use this second power three times per day.

of Brachiation
**XP Value:** 100 **GP Value:** 1,000
DUNGEON MASTER Guide, 1st Edition

These wrist bands appear to be of the ordinary
sort, but they enable the wearer to move by
swinging from one tree limb or vine to another to
get from place to place. This power can only be
employed in locales where these kinds of envi-
ronmental conditions exist. Movement is at a rate
of 3, 6, or 9—the more jungle-like the conditions,
the greater the movement rate.

The wearer is also able to climb trees, vines,
poles, and ropes at a rate of 6, and can swing ona

rope, vine, or other dangling, flexible object as if

The wearer can also jump as if wearing boots
of striding and springing, but the jump must cul-
minate in the grasping of a rope or vine, move-
ment through the upper portion of trees, the
climbing of a tree or pole, or some other activity
associated with brachiation.

of Brandishing
**XP Value:** 3,000 **GP Value:** 15,0000
Tome of Magic

These unpredictable and bewildering items appear
similar to other magical bracers, but their magic is
revealed only when the character wearing them
uses a charged rod, staff, or wand. When a charge is
expended from such an item, the bracers of bran-
dishing alter the charge expenditure and the local
balance of magical forces in a chaotic manner. The
drain on the charged rod, staff, or wand is actually
in the range of five charges to -4 (the item is
recharged). The number of charges used is 1d10 -5
(with negative results indicating that charges are
restored). If an item is reduced to fewer than zero
charges by a drain, it crumbles into dust.

Items that are not normally rechargeable can
be recharged through the chaotic operation of
these items except for the rod of absorption.

These appear to be bracers of defense, and actu-

anger by a dangerous enemy. At that moment, the
bracers drop Armor Class to 10 and negate any
and all other magical protections and Dexterity
bonuses. Bracers of defenselessness can be

These magical bracers function like bracers of

wearer an effective Armor Class of 2. In addition,
if the wearer chooses to attempt to parry an oppo-
nent’s attack, the bracers cause the opponent to
take a -4 attack penalty, making a successful par-
rying attempt more likely. The wearer may only
parry in this manner against one opponent in any
round, and cannot attempt to parry unless the
wearer takes no offensive action during that round.

periods of time. Legends say that nothing can

harm the wearer when they are worn. No spell or
weapon can pass though the protection the brac-
ers provide, but then again, no nonattack can pen-
etrate either. If the bracers are worn, they do not
allow the wearer to eat, drink, or touch another
thing. The wearer cannot attack another crea-
ture—even with missile weapons. The unfortu-
nate user is completely cut off from everything,
levitating slightly above it. Once removed, the
bracers return to where they had been found,
which means they return to Lumbe. The bracers
cannot be physically removed from a body, unless
the wearer removes them, and then they immedi-
ately teleport away. Sarelk has never put them on,
so they always return to him.

These devices allow a wearer to swim at a con-

and at a speed of 12 indefinitely, The bracers also
confer water breathing upon the wearer for an
indefinite period. They do not, however, allow
one to use fire or to wield weapons underwater as
one could on the surface. The bracers appear to
be ordinary wrist guards or arm guards; they con-
tain no engraving or other elaborate decoration.
As with all magical bracers, both must be worn
by the same character in order to work.

Noj’s Bracers of Brandishing

**XP Value:** 3,000 **GP Value:** 15,000
1992 Fantasy Collector Card 514
The nature of Noj’s bracers has been warped by his
claw of magic exchange so that the bracers appar-
ently have a 60-foot, radial area of effect. Should
Noj used a charged item (rod, wand, staff), the
number of charges spent is chaotically altered by
1d10-5, crumbling to dust any item whose charge
counts falls to zero or less, while actually recharg-
ing others. But thanks to Noj 5 magical claw (and
his generally double-edged life), anyone who uses
their own charged item within 60 feet of Noj expe-
riences the same effects.

Phandoorl’s

**XP Value:** 4,000 **GP Value:** 20,000
Menzoberranzan Campaign Set

Named for the ancient drow wizard who devised

them, these dark, ordinary looking bracers have

been made by many wizards since, because they

ON renee

are extremely useful. They automatically protect
the wearer against all attacks by all sorts of arach-
nids and snakes (including other beings who have
magically assumed such forms), forcing them to
attack the wearer of these bracers at -3 on attack
rolls, and allowing the wearer a +2 bonus on all
saving throws vs. webs (of any sort—even webs
and web monsters, which have nothing to do with
arachnids), venom, acidic, and other secretions.

In addition, Phandoorl’s bracers completely
ward off all attacks made by whips of fangs, those
borne by priestesses of Lloth; the fanged heads of
such weapons simply cannot touch the wearer of
the bracers.

Phandoorl’s bracers may be worn under cloth-

around the thighs, biceps, or ankles, as well as
wrists, and still function normally. If a single

throws vs. poison, webs, and secretions.

Brass Horseman

These brass golems were created by the ancient race
of the City of Brass as guardians and guides. They
serve only those who know the command words—
all others are attacked on sight. Only by learning the
command words and finding a brass horseman can
one visit the fabled City of Brass, for the horseman
may be commanded to guide its master to the city
and grant protection for the journey.

Brassier of Defense

The brassier of defense will not come off except by
command of the wearer, granting the wearer an
Armor Class 2 while in use. It lowers the morale of
all males attacking the wearer by -1. This piece of
clothing cannot be worn by males, and automati-
cally adjusts to fit the female wearing it.

Brazier
A brazier is a metallic receptacle used for holding
hot coals. These are often used to heat rooms, but
are more commonly covered with grills to cook
food. Magical braziers are commonly used to
summon and control fire elementals, or to create

magical effects covering large areas.

**XP Value:** 4,000 **GP Value:** 25,000
DUNGEON MASTER Guide, 1st Edition
This device appears to be a normal container for
holding burning coals, however, if detect magic is
used, a dweomer is present. It enables a wizard to
summon an elemental of 12 Hit Dice from the
Elemental Plane of Fire. A fire must be lit in the
brazier—one round is required to do so. If sul-
phur is added, the elemental gains +1 on each Hit
Die (1d8+1 hit points per Hit Die). The fire ele-
mental appears as soon as the fire is burning and

. acommand word is uttered. (See the MONSTROUS

MANUAL accessory for other details.)

In Ravenloft: The elemental cannot return to
its native plane unless it finds a normal escape
route from Ravenloft. If the elemental is freed
somehow from control, it attacks the summoner.

Hu’i Wing
**XP Value:** 600 **GP Value:** 1,200
Kara-Tur
Under Karak is a huge subterranean fortress built
by the Kozakurans, with many unexplored levels
(mostly flooded). Local rumors have the invaders
still hiding below. It is an extremely dangerous
place and few brave souls dare to enter, but some-
where in its depths lies the singular, most valu-
able Koryoan relic, the hu’i wing.

For many years it was the centerpiece of a shrine
near Goisho, where monks of the Wing-ta order
tended it. It was stolen by the Kozakurans and car-
ried to Karak where it was built into the fortress
below the city. It is a huge copper brazier, 8 feet in
diameter, with an ornately carved lip of swimming
dragons and sail-finned carp. A fire must be started
in it—the hotter the better. When the brazier begins
to glow with heat, the dragons and carp become
cherry-red and begin to flow around its lip. Soon
they begin to swim, faster and faster, until they are
a blur of flames spinning about the coals.

Anyone viewing the flames at this point sees
them flashing white, as time is torn and fades into a
picture of the future. An important event is revealed,
such as a disaster, a civil war, or an assassination,
but the vision will not involve the personal des-
tinies of the watchers, unless they are very impor-
tant indeed! The vision is the same event for all, but
come from a different perspective for each, and
those events do come to pass in the next year. This
knowledge can be used for good or evil, to prosper
or aid, at the viewer's discretion. The object cannot

DUNGEON MAsTER Guide, 1st Edition

This device is exactly like a brazier commanding
fire elementals. However, when a fire is started
within it, the burning causes great clouds of mag-
ical smoke to pour out in a cloud with a 1-foot
radius around the brazier, All creatures within the
cloud must save vs. spell or fall into a deep sleep.

At the same moment, a fire elemental of 12 Hit
Dice appears and attacks the nearest creature.
Sleepers can be awakened only by a dispel magic
or remove curse spell.

Bridle
This leather apparatus is placed about the head of
a riding animal for control and guidance and
includes a headstall, bit, and reins. A horse or

unless it has multiple heads.

of Acquiesce
**XP Value:** 500 **GP Value:** 2,500
Dracon Magazine 73

When placed on a recalcitrant beast, the bridal of
acquiesce forces the creature to obey the ordinary
commands of its master. It cannot, however, force
an animal to act against its own fears (for exam-
ple, to run into a fire), nor does it have any effect
when unusual orders are given—the beast simply
does not understand. The harness is particularly
useful for mules and camels.

Plane Shifter
**XP Value:** 6,000 **GP Value:** 30,000
New ltem

This is a marvelous piece of tooled leather,
adorned with emerald and stainless metal, that
fits any equine beast, whether it be a mule, a
horse, a pegasus, or a unicorn. If fitted upon the
head of such a beast, the rider can move from the
Prime Material Plane to one of the Outer or Inner
Planes. Unfortunately, there is little contro! over
where the bridle takes the rider.

Each bridle is designed to home in on a spe-
cific Outer or Inner Plane, and the stamps on the
leather are designed to give some sort of impres-
sion of the destination. For example, a bridle cen-
tered on the Elemental Plane of Fire is stamped
with little flames. The Outer Plane destination is
stamped with its symbol (found in the
PLANESCAPE boxed set), and the Prime Material
designation is stamped in a swirling combination
of earth, air, fire, and water.

To use the bridle, one must merely touch the
stamp and speak the name of the plane to which it
is associated. There is a moment of whirling ver-

"ii

tigo, and character and mount are instantly trans-
ported to the last place where the bridle was used.
Unfortunately, this is not always the best of all
possible situations. ...

of Soaring
**XP Value:** 1,600 **GP Value:** 8,000

This bridle gives the mount the ability to fly (as
the wizard spell) at any rate up to 360 feet per
turn. The speed is not affected by encumbrance,
but the duration is six hours per day if the animal
is lightly encumbered or three hours if fully
laden. The total time is not limited to a single
journey and may be used in any number of parts.
Each night uses one turn of flying time even if the
flight is only of a few rounds’ duration.

of Speaking
**XP Value:** 1,400 **GP Value:** 7,000

This bridle gives the mount the ability to under-
stand and speak in the common tongue. Since
most riding animals are not highly intelligent, the
words and ideas are limited.

The Book of Marvelous Magic
When used by an animal trainer (an NPC special-

can only be used on large four-legged mounts,
such as egriffons, hippogriffs, and pegasi.

of Wings
**XP Value:** 1,500 **GP Value:** 7,500

On command, this item causes wings to grow
from the mount. A normal horse gains the
movement rate of a pegasus (480 feet per turn
flying) with these wings. The effected creature
probably (90%) will not cooperate at first, dis-
liking the sudden appearance of the wings and
refusing to fly. This chance can be reduced if
the animal is handled carefully and spoken to
(using a speak with animals spell); the chance
decreases by 10% per turn of explanation. A
bridle of wings functions three times per day for
up to one hour per use. The wings disappear at
the end of the hour.

A brooch is an ornamental piece of jewelry with a

DUNGEON Magazine 11
This item appears to be a decorative pin set with
rubies, worth about 2,500 gp. However, it has dis-
tinct magical properties and can be used by a PC
of any race and class. Each brooch has 1-50
charges.

Once per week, the brooch allows the wearer to
teleport himself plus an additional 750 Ibs. to any
part of the Prime Material Plane familiar to the
person. This power drains two charges. Up to
three times per week (but never more than once
per day), the wearer can blink (as the 3rd-level
wizard spell), except that the distance of dis-
placement is 6 feet, and the direction of displace-
ment is of the wearer’s choosing. This power
drains one charge. Once a day, the wearer can
become invisible (as the spell). This power uses
no charges.

Furthermore, the brooch acts like a ring of pro-
tection +1 so long as the wearer has it on his or
her person and wears no other form of magical
protection or armor. The brooch of begoing may
be worn with bracers of defense, however. No
charges are drained by this ability.

Equus
**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 8,000
DUNGEON Magazine 22

An equus is a magical piece of jewelry that, upon
command, polymorphs into some form of a beast
of burden. The word “equus” (plural “equi”)
comes from an ancient language and has no lit-
eral translation in the common tongue. The clos-
est translation is “beast of burden” or “horse,” but
the word can be applied to anything that is used
like a horse. Thus, an actual horse, mule, worg,
camel, dog-sled team, nightmare, or any other
creature that can be ridden, used to pull a load, or
carry goods can be termed an equus. Equi come
in many different varieties, with the most com-
mon listed below. While 80% of equi are either
good or neutrally aligned, 20% polymorph into
evil creatures such as nightmares, worgs, and
giant spiders. It is said that the death knight Shan
Nikkoleth once possessed an eguus that polymor-
phed into gorgon form.

This is a simple copper or silver brooch in the
shape of the creature it becomes after polymorph-
ing. The command word is engraved on the back
of the brooch, It may be worn as a decorative pin
or used as a clasp for a cloak or cape.

Creature List

The DM may choose the form of the creature into
which the equus polymorphs from the following
table. The jewelry form polymorphs into one type
of creature only. A DM who prefers to roll ran-
domly should add the roll of 1d8 to that of 1d12
and consult the table below. The DM should use
only a creature he or she feels comfortable with
and is sure will not give the PC an unfair advan-
tage in the campaign. Types of creatures can be
added to or deleted from the list as the DM sees
fit. Any of the following creatures that do not
appear on Table 49 in the PHB should be consid-
ered equal to a heavy horse in movement rate and
encumbrance.

If the equus is slain (reduced to 0 hit points or
fewer) in creature form, the creature immediately
reverts to brooch form and cannot change into
creature form again. Damage to the creature form

of the equus can be healed magically by cure

wounds spells. If the creature is allowed food and
rest, it heals naturally at the rate of | hit point per
day. However, the eguus can neither heal itself
nor be healed while in brooch form.

Ivory Plume of Maat
**XP Value:** **GP Value:**
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Master Set

This small, exquisitely crafted brooch, shaped
like a feather, was created by a great paladin, the
beautiful fighter Maat. She was a many-talented
mortal, and strove always to promote good over
evil. Her device is said to enable the user to fol-
low in her noble footsteps, doing good deeds and
furthering the cause of law and justice.

The plume is 3 inches long, made of very fine
ivory. The plume is active when acquired. Knowl-
edge of the powers is granted immediately, tele-
pathically, to any user who is a paladin or good
knight. Any other would-be user must gain the
knowledge through a contact other plane or com-
mune spell, by asking Maat directly.

Each of the following powers is activated by
mental command alone:

Suggested Powers: (All abilities are at 20th
level.) Dispel evil, geas, continual light, turn (as
20th-level priest), lie detection, know alignment,
choose best option (duration one turn; affects one
choice), purify food and water, repair normal
objects (affects up to 100 pounds of nonmagical
material), remove fear, saving throw bonus (+4
bonus), immune to disease (range touch; affects
al) nonmagical diseases; duration 18 turns),
immune to energy drain (range touch; duration
six turns).

Suggested Handicaps: When first used, a wall
of stone forms as a closed cylinder around the
user. However, if the user closes his or her eyes,
thinks of justice (or Maat), and steps forward, the
wall vanishes when touched. The wall is com-
pletely invulnerable to outside attacks, including
a wish. If the wall is destroyed or damaged by the
user, he or she takes double damage from all
physical attacks (no saving throw, and unremov-
able, as a handicap). Secondly, alignment changes
to a lawful bent; if already lawful, the character
becomes more rigidly so, and works more actively
to defeat chaos.

Magic error: An 80% chance of error applies
whenever the user casts a spell (or uses a magical
device requiring a command word) to harm any

 

 

Brooch of Number Numbing

"\CrCrNU TE

lawful or neutral creature that has no evil inten-
tion.

Suggested Penalties: Whenever the item is
touched, and if the creature touching the plume is
chaotically-aligned or has evil intentions, disinte-
grate is cast with no saving throw.

If the user slays a lawful creature, he or she is
immediately reduced to —-10 hp, and dies (no sav-
ing throw).

The following have standard chances of either

occurrence:

¢ Harden: A volume of up to 30,000 cubic feet
of mud, mire, swamp, or other muck suddenly
dries completely, if within 120 feet of the user.

* Opponents: 1d4 chaotically-aligned enemies
magically materialize out of the air, within 30
feet of the user. All the creatures are of one
type; the type has a number of Hit Dice equal
to 31-50% (1d20+10) of the user’s levels. The
creatures are native to the user’s plane of exis-
tence (consider undead as native to any plane).
Each opponent has maximum possible hit
points. Neither side has surprise.

mal form (no saving throw). They remain as ani-
mals until they leave the lighted area. The /unar

tinuously while worn.

The brooch must be in plain sight to have any
effect. Anyone conversing with someone wearing
the brooch is allowed a saving throw vs. spell to
avoid the effects.

If the saving throw fails, the victim falls under
the brooch’s special enchantment. The victim for-

gets the relative value of numbers and cannot

Brooch of Obsidian Shattering

remember if five is greater than three or if tens
are smaller than hundreds. Furthermore, the vic-
tim does not recognize his or her inability to
remember the values of numbers. While under
the influence of the brooch, the victim thinks that
all numbers are pretty much the same. He or she
accepts any claim pertaining to numbers and
accepts almost any financial deal.

The victim remembers the relative values of
coins (that gold pieces are worth more than silver
pieces), but not their exact conversions. Thus, the
victim is unable to remember whether 2 sp or 100
sp are equal to 1 gp.

The enchantment lasts only as long as the
wearer is present and for 2d6 rounds after that.
Once the effect wears off, the victim regains a
normal understanding of numbers. Furthermore,
he or she remembers exactly what was said and
done while under the influence of the brooch,
although, perhaps, not the cause.

up to 60 charges, and must be activated by being
touched with a piece of obsidian (that turns into
dust) as the elven word “shallackan” (shatter) is
spoken. The brooch shatters all obsidian within
120 feet of the wearer when activated. These
brooches are especially effective in disarming
opponents armed with obsidian weapons.

A pair of 2-inch platinum pins in the shape of

two individuals—on clothing, or directly on their
bodies. A wearer hears what the other is saying in
his or her native language. This effect is similar to
a comprehend languages spell. The translation
works only between two wearers. The pins can be
transferred from one person to another as often as
necessary. Only verbal communication is trans-
lated. The pins of communication lose their magic
if they are separated by 100 feet for more than
five minutes.

this mundane task, it can be used to absorb magic

Broom

Brooms consist of a 4- to 6-foot-long wooden
pole that serves as the item’s handle. A fan of
straw or similar material is attached to one end of
the handle with a length of thread or a metal ring.
When drawn across a floor or other firm surface,
the straw gathers up loose dirt for easy removal.
(Please note that it is possible for an individual to
have a magical broom without ever being aware
of it.)

of Animated Attack

DuNGEON MAstTER Guide, 1st Edition

Indistinguishable from a normal broom, except
by means of magical detection, this item is identi-
cal to a broom of flying by all tests short of
attempted use, Using it reveals that a broom of
animated attack is a very nasty item.

If a command word (“soar”) is spoken, the
broom does a loop-the-loop with its hopeful rider,
dumping the hapless flyer on his or her head from
1d4+5 feet off the ground. The broom then
attacks the stunned victim, swatting the would-be
rider’s face with the straw end and beating with
the handle.

The broom gets two attacks per round with
each end (two swats with the straw, two with the
handie). It attacks as if it were a 4-HD monster.
The straw end causes blindness for one round if it
hits. The other end causes 1d3 points of damage
when it hits. The broom is Armor Class 7 and
takes 18 hit points to destroy.

spell or be blinded. The broom is AC 0, has 20 hp,
and can be affected only by magical spells or
weapons.

cally only while indoors and only if commanded
by a wizard. Upon command, it grows arms. It
can carry up to 500 pounds and is able to grow up
to six arms, as needed, to perform its duties. It
may be commanded to sweep and can clean a 10-
by 10-foot area of dust and grime in six rounds, It

Sweeping IT
**XP Value:** 120 **GP Value:** 600

This is a straw broom of normal appearance,
Upon the utterance of the proper command word
(written in Common on the end of the handle), it
sweeps out the room it occupies. It does not oper-
ate outdoors. It will attempt to sweep out all
unprocessed organic material such as dirt, leaves,
and living and dead animals and insects, even
humans. The reverse of the command word, or
completion of the task, stops it.

Brush

A brush consists of a wooden or ceramic piece, 4
to 6 inches long that serves as the handle. One
side of the handle is generally ornately decorated.
The other side has several hundred, thin animal
hairs, or bristles, embedded in it. There are spe-
cialized brushes designed for all kinds of tasks
from personal grooming to applying paint.

Vladium’s Fabulous Equine
**XP Value:** 600 **GP Value:** 3,000
POLYHEDRON Newszine 82

This magical brush is made of silver and inlaid
with tortoise shell. The bristles are of fur from a
giant, black ermine. Although the bristles are
soft, they easily remove dirt, debris, and loose
hair from any mammal with the first stroke. The
great paladin Audry Vladium grew tired of the
constant grooming and time required to keep her
war horse immaculate, and so she commissioned
the creation of the brush from a long-forgotten
wizard. There are only about a dozen such
brushes known to be in existence.

Bucket of Fire Snuffing
**XP Value:** 500 **GP Value:** 2,500
DRAGON Magazine 73

This miniature, bronze bucket has a bronze inner
surface that looks much like water. If the bucket
is brandished at a fire, as though water were
being thrown from it, the fire reacts as though a
normal bucket of water had been thrown on it,
except that no chemical reaction takes place. The
bucket can be used repeatedly on any normal fire.
It has no effect on magical fires.

Buckle
A magical buckle looks like any ordinary buckle
and is used to fasten a belt about the waist. Magi-
cal buckles are always made of fine metal (often
gold or platinum) and may be decorated with

Oh ceaestetemnneeissneeciieeiiieaeietieeseemmmanassantemaeemeemmamaamasmeiamateeal

gems. If the owner does not know it is magical, it
might be sold for 100-600 gp. If two or more

in which smal] objects may be kept. It contains
several miniature weapons when found, each
about an inch long—a mace, spear, war hammer,
battle axe, two-handed sword, and a light cross-
bow with 10 quarrels. When any one of them is
held and the command word uttered, the item
enlarges to full size. There is a different com-
mand word for each weapon, and the weapons
have no plusses when enlarged. If the word is
spoken a second time, the held weapon returns to
miniature size and may be replaced in the buckle.
Each weapon can be enlarged only once per day;
a dispel magic spell causes any enlarged weapon
to shrink (no roll needed).

Buttercup’s Bouquet
**XP Value:** 600 **GP Value:** 2,400
POLYHEDRON Newszine 43

Buttercup, a charming and ingenious half-elf of
the locksmith persuasion, was best known for her
wit and ingenuity. She favored a device crafted
specifically for her by an infatuated, magic-using
admirer. It resembled a collection of glorious
blossoms and was made to be worn on the lapel
or in the hair. When a secret catch is released, a
gaseous substance squirts forth, blinding every-
one within a 15-foot radius. Buttercup, of course,
knew to keep her eyes closed. The fumes dissi-
pate immediately, but the blindness persists for
1d8 rounds per individual.

Button

Buttons are small disk- or barrel-shaped knobs
that are attached to an article of clothing. They
serve as fasteners when passed through a loop or
button hole. Buttons are commonly made from
bone, wood, coral, shell, metal, or ceramic. Magi-
cal buttons cannot be discerned from mundane
buttons without the use of a detect magic spell.

sharp edges that do 2d6 damage on contact. The
full size discs may be thrown up to 200 feet and
disintegrate on contact.

This small, dark ivory bone button may be used

it is placed on cloth and the command word spo-
ken, the cloth becomes nigid; the cloth is treated
as if a stout door fastened by a wizard lock cast by
a 21st-level wizard. Something such as a normal
blanket may thus be used to secure valuables. The
button unlocks when touched and the command
word spoken.

Cabinet

Cabinets are wooden constructs used to
hold a variety of items. The size, shape, and over-
all dimensions of a cabinet depend largely upon
what it’s designed to hold. For example, a tall
cabinet might hold long garments, weapons,
farming tools, or other large objects. Locks can
be easily installed on cabinets to help protect
valuable contents.

of Air Restoration
**XP Value:** 600 **GP Value:** 6,000
DRAGON Magazine 159

With the recent flood of groundling adventurers
moving into space, the arcane have introduced a
new item needed on many heavily laden ships—
an air supply device. Many of these are included
with new helms, instead of offering helms with
portal locators. They have also been sold to older
customers at a fixed price. The cabinet of air
restoration works on the same principle as a fur-
nace helm, by drawing magic from magical
items, The small cabinet stands 2 feet tall by 1-
foot wide; two small doors in its front open to
reveal a hollow area 10 inches square. The front
and sides of the cabinet are of dark hardwood, but
the base and repository within the cabinet seem
to be made of crystal—the same crystal found in
many minor helms. When an item is placed inside
the cabinet, the crystal glows deep green, bright-
ening whenever it is producing fresh air. When a
charged, magical item is placed within the cabi-
net, 1d3 charges are immediately drained away
prior to use. With each subsequent use, the cabi-
net of air restoration drains one charge from the
magical item and generates 50 cubic yards of
fresh air, enough to support up 12 crewfolk for
one week before the air becomes foul; a single
command word activates this function.

A second command word activates the full
potential of the cabinet of air restoration, allow-
ing it to regenerate the entire air envelope of the
ship. When commanded, the cabinet drains 1d8
charges for every 10 tons of the ship and restores
the atmosphere by one rank. For example, to
restore the atmosphere aboard a hammership (a
60-ton ship) from foul air to fresh, the cabinet
would drain 6d8 charges from an item. The
atmosphere would be completely restored, sup-
porting a crew of 60 for four to eight months with
a regenerated atmosphere.

This item is used in conjunction with H’veyk’s
robe of immediate access (see Robe). The cabi-

is through the H’Veyk's robe of immediate access.
If the cabinet is broken into (AC 3, hp 30), the
wearer of the robe has only a 25% chance of
finding items when digging through the robe’s
pockets.

The cabinet can hold a total of 200 pounds of
material, allowing the robe’s wearer to immedi-
ately find whatever is needed (unless, of course,
someone breaks into the cabinet).

This cabinet appears identical to a cabinet of

only once per month.

unless another command is uttered, but it is then
carried easily, having only 100 pounds encum-
brance, regardless of its contents. A third com-
mand causes shelves to appear or disappear
within it, as many as desired and spaced in any
manner; the shelves cannot be removed by any
means. The cabinet can hold up to 1,000 pounds
or any object small enough to fit inside.

This cage is identical to a cage of carrying. How-
ever, when touched to a creature, the cage
expands to a 9-foot cube and fills with 1,000
ordinary bats—then the cage disintegrates. The
user may point the cage in any direction, and the
bats will travel in that direction for at least 1d4+1
rounds. Afterward, the bats are not under any sort
of control. The batting cage is useless after that,
but the bats are real and permanent.

gence, such as a war horse, the creature must
make a saving throw vs. spell; if it fails, the
beast is drawn into the cage in miniature form
along with all the equipment it carries. Mounted
tiders are unaffected except by the disappear-
ance of their mounts. The cage can be used to
avoid leaving one’s horse and equipment out-
side a dungeon. —

of Entrapment
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** 1,500

This cage looks and functions like a cage of car-
rying. However, if a touched animal] makes its
saving throw against the effect, the user is drawn
into the cage in miniature form instead, with all
equipment carried, and cannot be released until a
remove curse spell is applied. Items carried and
spells known by an entrapped victim cannot be
used until the victim is released.

of Shelter

**XP Value:** 1,500 **GP Value:** 7,500

The Complete Fighter's Handbook.

This object looks like a large bird cage that has

been neatly folded into a package about the size of

a medium shield, The user, who can be of any char-

acter class, places it on the ground, steps back, and
claps his or her hands loudly two or three times.

If the hands are clapped twice, the cage grows
into a sturdy, metal-framed tent that can house
eight people or two horses. The tent confers no
magical benefits on its inhabitants, but by using it
and huddling together for warmth, a party can
survive a snowstorm that would kill an unpro-
tected party. lf the tent is erected in the desert, a
party can avoid the danger and discomfort of a
sandstorm.

If the user claps his or her hands three times,
the cage grows into a strong 10- by 10-foot cell.
The door to the cell has the equivalent of a wizard
lock; the cage’s owner can open it at any time, and
any magician with a knock spell can open it by
using that spell. A person in the cell would have
to make a successful bend bars/lift gates roll (or
use a knock spell) to escape; the door’s lock can-
not be picked.

To return the cage to its original form, the
owner Claps again, twice if it is in tent form, three
times if it is in cage form. If someone is in the
tent while it is collapsing, it opens around the
person inside—both the tent and the victim are
unhurt. If someone is in it when it is a cage and it
collapses, it inflicts 2d6 damage before it breaks
open—after that it is ruined forever.

The cage of shelter knows its owner. If someone
finds it in a treasure, the finder must carry it in his
or her gear for one month so that the cage can
attune itself to its new owner. If its true owner sells
it to someone else in the cage’s presence, the cage
will obey the claps of its new owner immediately.

String
**XP Value:** 500 **GP Value:** 2,500
The Complete Ranger’s Handbook

This looks like a piece of white thread 20 feet
long, flecked with gold. When arranged in a cir-
cle so that the ends touch, the string cage creates
an invisible barrier that prevents any creature
contained inside from leaving. The invisible bar-
rier has the strength of a wall of force and has the
shape of a closed cylinder about 6 feet tall. The
string cage functions only if it is placed on the
ground or other solid surface; if it is moved, the
barrier dissipates. Because of its light weight, the
string can’t be thrown like a lasso; if rocks or
other weights are attached, its magic is negated.
Therefore, the device is mainly used to contain
sleeping, trapped, restrained, or cooperative crea-
tures.

A string cage can contain any single creature,
so long as the creature fits inside the circle. Phys-
ical attacks and most spells have no effect on
string cages. The creature trapped inside can’t
move it. A disintegrate spell destroys the device,
as will a rod of cancellation or a sphere of annihi-
lation. A creature contained in a string cage can
escape by using dimension door, teleport, or a
similar spell. Only the person who originally
formed the circle can separate the ends and free
the creature inside, Otherwise, a string cage lasts
for 3d4 hours, at which time the ends separate
automatically. A string cage can be used only
once per day.

Cameo

A cameo is a gem or stone carving showing a
relief design in one color against a background of
another, usually darker hue. Stones with bands of
color—such as onyx—make the best cameos.
The designs on a cameo may take nearly any
form, but the most common patterns are nature
scenes and busts (portraits showing a silhouette
of the head and neck).

charmed, the fighter obeys nearly any instruc-
tion, even if it involves certain death. If the
fighter fails any saving throw, he or she van-

pear when the fighter vanishes.

Equus
**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 8,000
DUNGEON Magazine 22

An equus is a magical piece of jewelry that, upon
command, polymorphs into some form of a beast
of burden. The word “equus” (plural “equi”)
comes from an ancient language and has no lit-
eral translation in the common tongue. The clos-
est translation is “beast of burden” or “horse,” but
the word can be applied to anything that is used
like a horse. Thus, an actual horse, mule, worg,
camel, dog-sled team, nightmare, or any other
creature that can be ridden, used to pull a load, or
carry goods can be termed an equus. Equi come
in many different varieties, with the most com-
mon listed below. While 80% of equi are either
good or neutrally aligned, 20% polymorph into
evil creatures such as nightmares, worgs, and
giant spiders. It is said that the death knight Shan
Nikkoleth once possessed an equus that polymor-
phed into gorgon form.

The cameo may be worn on a chain or pinned
to a garment. It bears an obsidian silhouette of a
creature on a turquoise background. The com-
mand word is etched on the reverse side.

Creature List

The DM may choose the form of the creature into
which the equus polymorphs from the following
table, The jewelry form polymorphs into one type
of creature only. A DM who prefers to roll ran-
domly should add the roll of 1d8 to that of 1d12
and consult the table below. The DM should use
only a creature he or she feels comfortable with
and is sure will not give the PCs an unfair advan-
tage in the campaign. Types of creatures can be
added to or deleted from the list as the DM sees
fit. Any of the following creatures that do not
appear on Table 49 in the PHB should be consid-
ered equal to a heavy horse in movement rate and
encumbrance.

If the equus is slain (reduced to 0 hit points or

 

235

less) in creature form, the creature immediately
reverts to cameo form and cannot change into
creature form again. Damage to the creature form
of the equus can be healed magically by cure
wounds spells. If the creature is allowed food and
rest, it heals naturally at the rate of 1 hit point per
day. However, the equus can neither heal itself
nor be healed while in cameo form.

This item appears and functions as a cameo of
appearance in all respects. However, the fighter
appearing never hits any targets and automati-
cally rolls a 1 on any attack roll. The fighter
keeps trying, however, and complains about bad
luck. The inept warrior also fails the first saving
throw required and then vanishes.

Can

A can is a cylindrical container. Each has two
command words; one to open, causing the top
to disappear, and one to close, causing the lid
to reappear. Cans may be from 2 to 6 inches in
diameter, and 2 to 12 inches in height. Some
recreate their contents each time they’re
opened. Other cans can be emptied only once,
but even these remain airtight and watertight.
Roll on the table below to determine the type
of can found.

Found in various sizes, these cylindrical metal
containers act like bags of holding except that
only food can be put into them. If anything else is
put into the can, the items disappear after three
rounds, Food placed in the cans neither rots nor
ages. Cans of preserving hold from 1-cubic-foot
to 6 cubic feet of food, depending on the size of
the can. Generally a can’s physical dimensions
are one third of its actual capacity; a 1-cubic-foot
can has a diameter of about 5 inches and is about
2-inches high. A 6-cubic-foot can is about 10
inches in diameter and about 4 inches high. The
weight of the food in a can of preserving is

Zwann’s Irrigation
**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 5,000
1992 Fantasy Collector Card 382

Zwann wasn’t satisfied to rest on the creation of
his watering can (see below). He wanted to make
it even more efficient, and he eventually created
the irrigation can. This can must be buried in the
ground and left there, but it conveys permanent
immunity to disease, drought, insects, bad
weather, and other nonmagical trauma over a half
acre of soil. A plot of land blessed with Zwann's
irrigation can will even grow crops throughout
the winter provided there is an average of four
hours of sunlight per day. So long as the can
remains in the ground, the land remains fruitful,
but the can must be annually unearthed and
“seeded” with 500 gold pieces.

Zwann’s Watering
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 5,000
Tome of Magic
Invented by the noted botanist Salerno Zwann,
this otherwise ordinary watering can is activated
when the user fills it with two gallons of water
and lets it stand undisturbed for 30 days. At the
end of that period, the user may sprinkle the water
from Zwann'’s watering can over a patch of tilled
soil no larger than a 25 feet square. Seeds subse-
quently planted in this treated soil grow normally,
but are permanently immune to disease, drought

insects, bad weather (such as hailstorms and early
frost) and all other forms of nonmagical trauma.
The plants can be harvested normally by the
planter.

Water from Zwann 5 watering can has no effect
on already maturing plants. It cannot revive with-
ered, diseased, or insect-infested plants. The
patch of soil retains its effectiveness for one year;
after that it must be watered again for the effect to
be renewed.

Candles

During preindustrial times, fire was the only
source of illumination for people’s homes after
the sun went down. Torches and oil lamps were
commonly used to light large rooms, while can-
dles served as small, portable sources of light for
reading or lighting one’s way to bed. Candles also
figured in many religious services as either part
of the altar ornamentation or as an aid to prayer
and meditation.

Early candles, also known as rushlights, con-
sisted of animal fats wrapped in rushes, husks,
or moss, then set alight. Later candles were
made of tallow obtained from animal fats or, in
the Orient, from the seeds of the tallow tree.
Wicks for the candle were also introduced and
were made of cloth strips or woven cord. Tallow
candles are very cheap compared to wax can-
dies, and this is reflected in the equipment list
in the PHB. These candles burn more quickly
and produce a fair bit of smoke, however. Wax
candles are used for making magical candles,
and there are several sources of wax for making
enchanted tapers.

Wizards use white candles made from sperma-
ceti, a waxy material obtained from sperm whales
and small and large bottle-nosed whales. Priestal
magical candles are made of beeswax taken from
either the regular or giant species of bee; the wax
produced is dark yellow in color. Druids use can-
dies made from the wax obtained from the bay-
berry, an evergreen shrub whose berries are
covered with a waxy coating. A bushel of berries
yields about four to five pounds of a pleasant
smelling, green wax.

Only the purest grade of wax is used in making
magical candles. That and the cost of the scent
that must be added to the wax in its liquid state
(acting as a bond between the wax and the special
ingredients used to impart magical properties),
vastly increase the cost of a wax candle specially

_

ordered by a spellcaster from a candlemaker.

Candles may be purchased ready made from a
candlemaker who will also, for an additional
charge, add whatever incense, perfume, oils, or
herbs are required to prepare the candle for
enchantment. A wizard may hire an alchemist to
prepare the candle and add whatever special
ingredient is required. Priests and druids may be
able to find a member of their order who is
skilled in candlemaking to perform the task. To
lessen the chance of spell failure when enchant-
ing the candle or investment when the finished
candle is placed upon the altar, the spellcaster
should make the candle himself.

There are two methods of candlemaking—
molding and dipping. A candle mold is the sim-
plest method. Molds should be made of either
pure silver or the bone of a creature of magic
such as a dragon. Wicks of woven silk cord are
placed in the molds, and the molten wax, with
its scents and magical ingredients already
mixed in, is poured into the molds and allowed
to cool. During the procedure, the spellcaster
chants or prays. After the candles have cooled,
the usual process for enchanting an item may
begin.

Dipping takes longer, but reduces the chance
of spell failure during enchantment, since the
spellcaster can more easily prevent imperfections
like cracks or air bubbles from forming in the
candle, While chanting or praying, the spelicaster
repeatedly dips the wicks into hot wax heated in a
crystal vat, allowing each coating of wax to cool
and harden before redipping. Once finished, the
candles are ready for enchantment. If the spell-
caster uses candles prepared by a candlemaker,
the chance of spell failure increases by +20.

Magical candles usually come in two sizes—
small ones about 3 inches long and the thickness
of a very small twig, and regular tapers 8 to 12
inches long and % to 1 inch thick. The large taper,
as stated in the DMG description of the candle of
invocation, burns for four hours and can be extin-
guished by normal means for later reuse. The
smaller candle burns for 10 minutes; its spell
effects, like the larger candles, cease once it is
extinguished.

Candle powers are effective within a 25-foot-
radius of the candle. Unless specifically stated,
all beings within the area of influence, except
the person who lit the candle and those who

enter the area of effect later, are affected by the

spell, Normal saving throws apply unless stated
otherwise or unless the spell effect is similar to
known spells. Except where noted, all candles
may be snuffed out by normal means. From 1d6
small candles or 1d2 large candles may be found
in a treasure cache; they may be all of a kind
(50%) or a mixed assortment chosen by the DM.
In a hoard, 80% of the candles will be small.
Experience point (XP) values listed are per
candle, for both small and large varieties. No
experience is gained from using cursed candles.

For every three days spent in making these
candles, they will burn for one turn, up to a maxi-
mum of 10 turns (for a candle which took 30 days
to make). The magic of these candles takes effect
when the candle is snuffed out, or burns down to
nothing at the end of its duration. These candles
must be burned in the presence of their intended
victims in order to work.

One curse can be placed on a victim for each turn
of burning, up to a maximum of six turns of

burning and six curses. The curses are:

Roll Curse
} Weakness (Strength reduced to 3).
2 Insanity (Intelligence and Wisdom both

reduced to 3).

| Clumsiness (Dexterity reduced to 3).

4 Poverty (all precious metals, gems and
jewels on the victim’s person turn to
clay).

5 Loneliness (Charisma reduced to 3).

6 Exhaustion (Constitution reduced to 3).

Saving throws can be attempted for each curse,
and if successful negate that particular curse only.
Casting remove curse negates one curse for each
casting of that spell. Saving throws may be
attempted, where applicable, for the effects of all
candles except red candles. Any candle that does
not burn continuously for at least one turn has no
effect. A candle extinguished midway through a
turn is treated as though it had not burned at all
during that turn, but the turn is counted against
the maximum amount of time a certain candle
may be burned. For example, a candle witha
maximum life of five turns is extinguished mid-
way through its third turn of burning. Its effects

ell

are as though it had only burned for two turns
(not two and a fraction), but if it is reignited after
that, it has only two turns of burning left before it
goes out automatically.

At least two such defense candles are needed to

the druid and wizard spells. The wall may be in
the form of a curtain up to 60 feet long between
the two candles, or in the form of a ring enclosing
a space up to 20 feet in diameter when the can-
dies are set on opposite sides of the individual
who lit them. The ring will move with the user
provided both candles are carried; the circle then
automatically shrinks to enclose only the bearer
of the candles. The wall reaches 20 feet high and
causes 4d6 hp damage to any creature passing
through it, 2d6 hp damage each round to crea-
tures within one to 10 feet of the candles, or 1d6
hp damage each round to creatures from 11 to 20

of Invocation
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 5,000
DUNGEON MASTER Guide
These specially blessed tapers are dedicated to
the pantheon of gods of one of the nine align-
ments. The typical candle is not remarkable, but
if a detection spell is cast, it radiates magic. It
also radiates good or evil, if appropriate.

Simply burning the candle generates a favor-
able aura for the individual so doing—if the
candle’s alignment matches that of the charac-
ter’s. If burned by a priest of the same alignment,
the candle temporarily increases the priest’s level
of experience by two, enabling additional spells
to be cast. He or she can even cast spells normally
unavailable, as if of a higher level, but only so
long as the candle continues to burn. Any burning
allows the casting of a gate spell, the respondent
being of the alignment of the candle, but the taper
is immediately consumed in the process.

Otherwise, each candle burns for four hours. It
is possible to extinguish the candle as one would
any other. However, it can be placed in a lantern
or otherwise sheltered to protect it from drafts
and other things that could put it out. This doesn’t
affect its magical properties.

In Kara-Tur: Candles of invocation are dedi-
cated to one of the three main ethical systems:
good, evil, neutrality.

Tome of Magic

This candle enhances attacks against a particular
enemy within a defined area. The user lights the
candle while speaking the exact name of a single
foe. If the exact name is not known, the user must
precisely identify the foe; saying, “the evil war-
rior” isn’t precise enough, but stating, “the evil
warrior who rules the village of Fair Meadows
and carries a golden shield” is sufficient.

All characters who remain within a 50-foot
radius of the lighted candle receive a +2 bonus to
all attack rolls made against the stated foe,
regardless of whether or not the foe is within 50
feet of the candle. Characters who venture out-
side the area of effect lose the bonus. When the
stated foe is within the area of effect, he or she
suffers a -1 penalty to all attack rolls.

There can be no interposing surfaces such as walls
or doors between the candle of propitiousness and
characters it affects. The stated foe is not allowed a
saving throw to resist the effects of the candle.

The candle of propitiousness burns for up to
one hour. If it is moved after it is lit, its magic is
immediately and permanently negated. Likewise,
if its flame is extinguished, its magic immediately
ends. Any magical or natural force capable of
extinguishing a normal flame, such as a gust of
wind or a splash of water, can extinguish a candle
of propitiousness. A candle of propitiousness can
be lit and used only once.

This candle burns normally for one round after being
lit, then apparently goes out. During the second
round, aerial fireworks shoot out of the candle’s tip
like the spell pyrotechnics, with the same blinding
effect on creatures within a 10-foot area of effect.
The candle does not perform the second function of
the pyrotechnics spell (obscuring smoke). These can-
dies are made with mimosa, phosphorus, and the
ichor from a will o wisp or a boggart.

Once lit, the smoke from this candle coalesces
into an image identical to the individual who lit
the taper. The image is capable of independent
movement within a 25-foot radius of the candle,
as ordered by the mental command of the candle
lighter, but cannot go past these bounds. Weap-
ons, clothing, and other items are copied exactly;
the image cannot do damage, nor can it cast
spells, though it may appear to do so. Each time a
person or creature encounters the image, he or
she must save vs. spell or mistake the image for
the person. The error is quickly realized when the
image is attacked, since any attack on the image
destroys it. The person who lit the candle may
step beyond the area of effect without destroying
the image, but must stay within sight of the image
in order to control it. The controller cannot take
any action other than movement at half speed;
doing otherwise destroys the image. Extinguish-
ing the candle cancels the illusion. These candles
are made with attar of roses and bay leaf, blood
from a giant chameleon and hangman tree sap,
plus several drops of quicksilver.

This object, made of an unknown substance, is

This taper is similar to the candle of divination, in
that the spelicaster who lit it can automatically
recall and cast any spell, that the caster knows. For
example, a 7th-level wizard who knows fireball is
able to recall and cast the spell twice, as permitted
by the wizard’s level of experience, without having
memorized the spell beforehand. These candles are
made with rosemary and sage, and blood from a
highly intelligent, nonhuman, spell-using creature.

of Transference
**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 10,000

When used, this item causes its victim to make
saving throws vs. spell with a —-4 penalty to the
roll. If the throw fails, the victim’s life force is
transferred to the flame, and the candle takes the
shape of the victim as the body disappears. A
remove curse cast upon the lit candle by a 26th-
or higher-level caster restores the victim com-
pletely, and the candle disappears—a wish may
also be used. If a speak with monsters spell is
used, the flame speaks with the voice and life
force of the victim. The flame does not burn the
candle and it cannot be extinguished, not even by
magical wind; only water or some magical
method can put it out. If put out, however, the
victim dies. A polymorph object spell can there-
after restore the body, but only if applied while
the candle is lit; otherwise the victim dies.

blanket a 50-foot-diameter area. Except where
stated, all characters and creatures within the area
of effect are affected, including those who enter
the cloud later. A successful save vs. poison pro-
duces no effect; failure to save causes the noted
effect to occur. The cloud dissipates one turn after
the candle is extinguished; it must be doused with
water to cease producing vapors. There are five
varieties:

Roll Candle Type
01-02 Insanity gas: Victims act as though
they were under the permanent effects
of confusion, as the priest spell. A heal,
restoration, limited wish, alter reality,

condition.
Poison: Creates a cloud of poison gas
against which all characters must save
or die (taking 20 hp damage if the save
is made).

Sleep: Affects all characters and crea-
tures of all levels within its 25-foot
radius, except the individual who lit the
candle. Sleep lasts while the victims
remain near the fumes, plus 1d10
rounds after their removal.

Smoke: A dense cloud of smoke
forms, totally obscuring vision beyond
2 feet. If the candle is lit within an
enclosed space smaller than half the
size of the cloud’s 50-foot-diameter,
spherical area of effect, all characters
including the one who lit the candle,
must save vs. poison or suffocate in

Invisibility does not resume if affected creatures

Candle Snuffer
A candle snuffer is a metal rod with a cup on one
end that is used to put out candles or other very

and may be from 2 inches to 3 feet in length.
Magical snuffers usually function when touched
to either the flame or body of a lit candle.

This snuffer appears to be a snuffer of dousing and

put out a larger fire, the snuffer explodes as a fire-

the area. Each victim may make a saving throw vs.
spell to take 4 damage, and fire resistance applies.
The explosion destroys the snuffer.

Cane
A cane is a wooden or metal stick normally used
for assistance in walking. Magical canes may be

This expends one charge. If two charges are
expended, the damage bonus is doubled, while
triple damage is caused when three charges are

Roll Condiment
1 Ketchup of Slowness: When this is
dumped on the ground or floor, any crea-
ture approaching within 10 feet of the
ketchup is slowed (moving and attacking

at half normal rate) for 1 hour.

Mustard of Success: This hardened, yel-
low goop has no effect unless an edged
weapon is used to “cut” it. Any weapon
thus treated gains a +2 bonus to all attack
rolls for one hour. The mustard may be
used to enchant up to three edged weapons.
Pepper of Sneezing: When one ounce of
this pepper is thrown at a creature, the
victim must make a saving throw vs. poi-
son or stop moving and sneeze for one
round. A new saving throw may be made
each round, but the victim continues to
sneeze until a saving throw is made.
Sneezing victims may not move, and suf-
fer a +2 penalty to AC, and a -2 penalty
to all saves (which does apply to further
attempts to stop sneezing).

Salt of the Earth: Each ounce of this salt
may be sprinkled on either one human-
sized creature or in a 10- by 10-foot area.
If used on a creature, a normal attack roll
is required to apply it. If successful, the
recipient takes double damage from each
wound after that, caused by an edged
weapon. The effect lasts 10 rounds or
until the salt is washed off. If used on an
area of ice or snow, the salt causes it to
melt in one turn, even if magically cre-
ated (such as a wall of ice).

Jelly of Attraction: This purple, sweet
smelling jelly attracts the attention of all
normal and magical insects within 30
feet. Giant-sized insects are permitted a
save vs. spell to resist the effect, but with
a -4 penalty to the roll. When attacking
an insect that is attracted to the jelly, the
attacker gains a +4 bonus on the first
attack roll, but the insect is then free of
the magical attraction and its effects,
even if the attack misses. An attack on
one insect does not disturb the others.
The jelly may be used only once, and is
eaten by the insects.

Jam of Logs: This lumpy, brownish goo
may be poured out onto the floor. On com-
mand, it grows to become pile of normal,
nonmagical wooden logs, completely fill-
ing a volume of 1,000 cubic feet. The logs
will block the passage of any solid crea-

day, after uttering the command word, the canteen
fills itself with the fresh, red yolks of an erdlu—a
refreshing treat for any inhabitant of Athas. This
item is meant to serve as a personal canteen for a
lone traveler. It is possible for a member of some

more than seven times in a single, one-week

illusions do not have their intended effect. Dis-

Only one cap can be made from a single beguiler

Dream Cap of Veluna
**XP Value:** 1,500 **GP Value:** 7,500
GREYHAWK Adventures
This cap was enchanted by a wizard who sought
to unlock the mysteries of the inner mind. The
result of his work is a small leather cap that can
affect the future of a sleeping wearer.

For each full night spent asleep, a wearer of the
cap experiences dreams of warning. A sleeper
dreams of a nest creature or force that will
threaten or attack him or her. If the character is to
be attacked by an NPC, monster, spell, or natural
hazard, the cap reveals it in a dream. However,

* ceneneeniniesinaeseeemeteennteneteeetneeeeeenninininttepninieatemenniitememmnieeel

the threatening force or creature is usually sym-
bolized rather than revealed in actual form. For
example, a minotaur may appear as a bull or a
large, hairy man; a fireball may appear as a land-
scape of flames (such as the Elemental Plane of
Fire).

A dreamer must save vs. paralyzation to face
the danger courageously. If the saving throw is
successful, he or she gains a +2 bonus on saving
throws, ability checks, and attack rolls while
encountering the real danger when it actually
arrives. If the saving throw fails, the character has
not faced his or her fears, and receives a -2
penalty to saving throws, ability checks, and
attack rolls in the actual encounter.

The character always remembers dreams
caused by the cap, though the DM need not men-
tion the memory unless the player asks. After the
actual encounter with the threat, a character can
make an Intelligence check in order to make the
connection between the dream and the reality.
Thus, the cap’s owner may not realize the cap’s
powers until after many nights of disturbing pre-
monitions.

This cap causes the wearer to fall into a deep
slumber. The victim cannot be awakened unless a
remove curse spell is applied; however, the
required level of caster is equal to the number of
turns spent asleep. Thus, after 36 or more turns
asleep, a remove curse from a 36th-level caster is
needed. The sleeping victim needs no food or

Pileus

**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** —

DunGeons & Dracons Master Set
The Pileus (pill-A-us) was made deliberately
similar to the red Liberty Cap, a long-time sym-
bol of freedom. An Immortal Paragon wizard
named Saturnius created it to bring freedom to
enslaved mortals. It is rumored that the wearer of
this cap will remain free forever, and can free
those imprisoned, no matter the reason.

The pileus is a simple, red felt cap, which
enlarges or shrinks to fit any user. It must be
worn if its powers are to be used.

This cap is inactive when found, and remains
inactive until the would-be user wears it while
freeing prisoners of his or her race. The night
after this act, the user receives knowledge of the
cap’s powers and the command words, while
dreaming.

The pileus produces its effects, either upon the
user or some object within range, whenever the
user mentally commands it to do so.

Suggested Powers: (All abilities are cast at 20th
level.) Dimension door, knock, free person (frees
all bonds, prison doors, and shackles). Magical
imprisonment is affected by a dispel magic spell
cast at 20th level.), immune to paralysis (Range
touch; Duration six turns.).

Suggested Handicap: Repel others. The user
slowly develops a invisible, repulsive aura; the
reaction rolls of all those coming within 30 feet
are penalized -3 when the artifact is first used.
However, treat any attack result on the Reaction
Table as “Flee in disgust.” Other characters may
make saving throws to try and tolerate the repul-
sion, but the given penalty applies to those rolls
as well. A new saving throw must be made for
each hour spent in the user’s presence.

Suggested Penalty: Rot. A body part becomes
diseased and falls off in one hour. This affects the
toes first (one by one), then the fingers, ears, and
nose, and then limbs. A cure disease applied
before the part falls off will negate the effect, at
least for that occurrence.

The wearer of this cap gains a +2 bonus to saving
throws against spells of one particular school of
magic. In addition, specialists of the designated
school cannot inflict a-1 penalty on a wearer’s
saving throws against their specialist spells. The
nature of the school cap is determined using a

Of these caps, 10% are mixed blessings since
they have a cursed side effect—the wearer suffers
a—I1 penalty to saving throws against spells of
opposition schools. The curse takes effect the
first time the wearer is subjected to a spell from
an opposition school. Once the curse has been
engaged, the cap cannot be removed except by
use of a remove curse spell.

of Sleep
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** 500
The Book of Marvelous Magic

This cap causes the wearer to fall into a deep
slumber. The victim cannot be awakened unless
a remove curse spell is applied; however, the
level of the caster needed is equal to the number
of turns spent asleep. Thus, after 36 or more
turns asleep, a remove curse from a 36th-level
caster is needed. The sleeping victim needs no
food or water.

Cap of Teleportation

of Teleportation

**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 5,000
Tall Tales of the Wee Folk
This red bonnet permits its wearer to teleport
without error to another location and back again,
once a day. The wearer raises his or her right
hand, says, “Here’s off to—,” and is instantly
transported to the named destination. The desti-
nation can be no more specific than a city, and
the wearer has no control over the exact spot he
or she appears. To return, one raises the left hand
and says, “Here’s off back to—,” naming the
place of origin. Again, the destination is hazy; the
wearer arrives somewhere within 1d4—-1 miles of
the point of original departure. A character is
transported with all immediate possessions. One
tale tells of a man who was about to be hanged in
a city to which he had (somewhat inadvertently)
teleported himself; as his last wish, he asked “to
wear the red cap in my pocket.” He then promptly
teleported himself home, bringing not only the
hangman’s noose around his neck, but the gal-
lowsplank as well!

of Vision
**XP Value:** 300 **GP Value:** 1,500
The Book of Marvelous Magic
This cap enables the wearer to see in the dark
(infravision, 90-foot range) whenever desired.

Caparison

A caparison is an ornamental covering for a
horse, covering its body but sometimes the neck
and head as well. It is usually worn only for
show, as for a parade, but magical caparisons are
often enchanted to be useful on adventures.
Magical caparisons are nearly always made for
specific groups of knights, and thus have spe-
cific color patterns woven into them showing
the symbols or coats of arms of those knights or
their liege lords. They are enchanted to enlarge
or shrink slightly to fit any horse from pony to
the largest draft or heavy war horse perfectly.
They also resist stains and stay perfectly clean,
regardless of the circumstances, and will not trip
nor blind their wearers.

Armored
**XP Value:** 4,000 **GP Value:** 20,000
New Item
The armored caparison grants the horse wear-

ing it a base Armor Class of 4 without the use

”" i caensereeeesterstenteeeesihreisennntieeieeesengeiaiaiennsnyineneienennenenmeslll

of actual barding. Any real barding worn
beneath it has no effect. Further, this armor
grants its wearer AC 0 against pointed, piercing
weapons‘such as arrows, quarrels, pikes, and
spears.

of Comparison
**GP Value:** 500

 

**XP Value:**
New Item

The caparison of comparison functions in all
respects as any other magical caparison. How-
ever, it has the additional quirk that within 14
days after it has been put into use, it curses its
rider with a form of deranged envy, such that the
rider begins to compare everything he or she has
with the possessions of friends and allies. The
rider is then compelled, every day after that, to
somehow acquire a possession of a friend that is
better than a similar item he or she owns. For
example, if the rider owns a sword +2 but the
rider’s best friend has a sword +3, he or she is
compelled to get that sword by any means pos-
sible, including theft and treachery. The rider
cannot be reasoned with on this matter, and only
a remove curse spell from a priest of 10th or
higher level frees the rider of envy—at least of
the magical variety.

of Enslavement

**XP Value:** **GP Value:** 500

 

New Item

The caparison of enslavement functions like
other magical caparisons, until such time as the
horse’s owner or regular rider climbs upon it
while the caparison is being worn. At that point,
the rider magically falls under the telepathic
control of the horse and must do whatever the
horse wants done. If the horse is tired of walk-
ing, the rider stops the horse and lets it rest. If
the horse is hungry, the rider feeds it or lets it
wander off to eat. If the horse wants to go
home, the rider takes it home. The enslavement
lasts even after the rider dismounts, so that the
rider tends to every whim of the horse, until a
remove curse spell from a priest of 10th or
higher level is cast upon the rider while
mounted on the caparison. Then the rider may
dismount and remove the caparison without fur-
ther effect.

**XP Value** **GP Value**
+1: 1,000 5,000
+2: 2,000 10,000
+3: 3,000 15,000
New Item

The caparison of protection functions as a ring of

protection, with the following exceptions:

* The bonuses to saving throws and Armor
Class are granted to both the horse and the
rider. If more than one being rides on the
horse’s back, the protective qualities of the
caparison function only for the horse.

* If magical barding is worn, the protective
qualities of the caparison function only for
saving throws, not for Armor Class.

¢ Only one caparison may be worn at a time by
any horse.

of Silence
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 5,000
New Item
The caparison of silence allows horse and rider to
travel soundlessly over any terrain. No sounds
made by the horse and rider (shouts, snorts, hoof-
beats) can be heard. This does prevent any spells
with verbal components from being cast by the
rider, however.

of Sustenance

**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 5,000
New Item
The caparison of sustenance allows the horse
(but not its rider) to go indefinitely without food
or water. It also keeps the horse looking perfectly
groomed and kills all equine parasites and minor
pests (such as flies) that touch either it or the
horse. Finally, it prevents all diseases having a
magical cause, and grants the horse a +3 bonus to
save against magically induced diseases, such as
from a cause disease spell or a mummy’s rotting
touch.

Cape

A cape is a sleeveless garment that falls loosely
from the shoulders and is fastened about the neck
with a chain or cord. A cape may be worn over
armor or ordinary clothes, or even over a coat. A
magical cape is made of fine cloth, often with
strands of gold or silver woven into the fabric.
(See also Cloak and Coat.)

Cape of Horns

of Disguise

**XP Value:** 500 **GP Value:** 3,000
The Book of Marvelous Magic
This cape allows the wearer to change body shape
into any form of the same approximate size. It
does not change facial features, voice, or size,
merely the appearance of the arms, legs, and
body.

of Good Hope

**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 15,000
The Book of Marvelous Magic
This item gives the wearer a morale of 10 (if
applicable) and a bonus of +4 on all saving
throws vs. fear. It also allows a saving throw to be
made without adjustments whenever magically
created fear is so powerful as to allow none nor-
mally .

of the Hornet
**GP Value:** 2,400

DRAGON Magazine 5
With this cape, the user may fly at 360 feet per
round indefinitely, The cape grants the user the
ability to fire as many as three “stings” each
round. A sting is a bolt of energy with a 25-foot
range that causes 1d4 points of damage to any
creature it hits. The user must use his or her
THACO to determine the attack’s success.

Wearing this cape grants the user a +2 AC
bonus against normal and magical missiles, but
not against any other type of attack. The wearer
can also turn invisible whenever desired (one turn
duration, followed by a one turn recharge period).
As with normal invisibility, once the user makes
an attack, the invisibility dissipates.

**XP Value:** 800

of Horns

**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 5,000
The Book of Marvelous Magic

This cape appears to be like any other, but, when
commanded to function, it causes horns to grow
from the wearer's head. The horns prevent the use
of any helmet, and this bestows a -1 penalty to
Armor Class if the victim usually wears any type
of armor, The horns cannot be used for attack and
may be removed safely only by a remove curse
spell. If the horns are broken off or damaged, the
victim loses 1d4 hit points permanently; this loss
can be regained only by a wish.

all other protective items, magical or ordinary, includ-
ing armor, shields, rings of protection, and so forth.

of Reeking
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** 1,000
The Book of Marvelous Magic
This cloak appears to be a cape of disguise, but,
when commanded to function, it makes the wearer
smell like a rotten fish. The smell is easily detected
for a range of 120 feet and ruins all chances for sur-
prise. The victim may not remove the cape until a
remove curse is applied by a caster of the 25th level.

Shadow
**XP Value:** 2,500 **GP Value:** 15,000
The Book of Marvelous Magic

This powerful cape is of immediate benefit to
thieves, it bestows a +25% bonus to hide in shad-
ows attempts. Any character may use the item,
however, and any creature not wearing metal armor
can hide in shadows with a 25% chance of success.
In addition, the cape enables the wearer to magi-
cally travel from one shadow to another; the effect
is identical to a wizard’s dimension door spell (360-
foot range, no chance of error), except that the user
must be in shadow to activate the cape and must
arrive in a shadow. The shadow cape may be used
for magic travel three times per day, but misuse
does not count as a use. (Any attempt to travel to
lighted or occupied areas fails.) Any fire, normal or
magical, can instantly destroy the cape unless the
user makes a successful saving throw vs. spell.

Carrague’s Iron Golem

Carrague’s [ron Golem
**XP Value:** 4,000 **GP Value:** 40,000
POLYHEDRON Newszine 84
Nineteen years ago, Carrague created what he
thinks is a better and more useful iron golem.
Unlike a normal golem, Carrague 3 iron golem is
not animated by an elemental spirit. Instead, a
fighter wears a suit of plain looking, magical
brown leather armor and a metal helmet fitted
with ruby lenses. The armor allows the fighter to

control all the golem’s actions at a distance.

The golem instantly responds to any motion
the fighter makes. The control range is 120 feet.
The golem also has the same THACO as the con-
trolling fighter. In addition, the controlling
fighter uses the ruby lenses to see through the
golem’s eyes. The fighter must mimic any action
the golem undertakes, which can make the fighter
rather conspicuous to opponents. However, the
fighter need not have the golem in view to control
it. Controlling the golem requires some concen-
tration. Damage to the fighter does not break
control over the golem, but the fighter can do
nothing else while operating the golem.

Carrague’s iron golem has all the powers and
immunities listed for iron golems in the
MONSTROUS MANUAL accessory, except that it can-
not breathe poison gas. If the fighter wearing the
armor is killed, paralyzed, or rendered unconscious,
the golem ceases to function. Destruction of the
armor renders the golem useless, and vice versa.

Carpet

Carpets, otherwise known as rugs, are floor cov-
erings designed to make a floor more comfortable
and more attractive. Often, carpets are hung on
walls in order to cover holes or open windows.
(Such carpets are more properly called tapes-
tries.) Magical carpets usually provide transport,
issue warnings, or trap intruders.

_ Accursed Rug

Accursed
**XP Value:** 400 **GP Value:** 2,000
Mordenkainen’s Fantastic Adventure

This rug 1s made from rich silks, and is finely
woven. Depicted upon its surface is an alien
wilderness consisting of rooted trees in strange
colors, multiheaded animals, and gaudily
plumed sawtooth birds among crooked, dun-col-
ored branches. Double suns, one red, the other
white, are seen rising, shedding their opulent,
mingling hues over a twisted, purplish river,
flowing through greenish yellow plants set
along its banks. In the distance is a grandiose
city, a miniature in perspective, but the distance
to it seems endless, suggesting that the artist’s
depth is distorted or that the city is gargantuan
in size,

This rug radiates magic and is actually an item
known to Tomorast as the accursed carpet. When
handled, the rug takes on one of the following
two aspects (50% chance of each):

* The rug animates, moving and attacking of
its own accord as if it were semi-intelligent.
The rug’s characteristics are: AC 5; MV 15
flying; HD 7; hp 40; #AT |; Dmg 2d10
points smothering; SA once attached, smoth-
ers for automatic damage; SD, see below.
The rug flies about, attempting to land on
and smother victims below it. When it hits, it
inflicts smothering damage automatically
until destroyed. Victims trapped under it
move at half speed, have a -2 penalty to ini-
tiative, and if a weapon used is while trapped
inside the rug (50% chance), it may only
inflict half damage.

+ In this aspect, the rug remains where it is on
the wall. Several strong, thick threads (2d6
strands, 50 feet long, of the carpet’s frilly
edging) hang from it. Attached to the end of
each thread 1s a foot wide mouth with many
teeth that seem especially made for severing
and chewing. Each “mouth” attacks as a 6
HD monster, inflicting 1d6+1 points of dam-
age per bite. Other statistics are as given
above.

Damaging the rug: In cither aspect, this rug is
immune to spell attacks. Fire and weapon attacks
affect it as follows:

* Torch: 1d6 points per hit.

* Flask of Burning Oil: 2d4 points initially,
[d4 points per round for the following three
rounds.

256

ommend

* Raging Fire (bonfire, cask of oil, etc.): 2d6
points per round in the fire: rug catches fire
for six rounds, 2d4 points per round.

« Magical fire: No effect.

Weapons: Piercing weapons and blunt weap-
ons inflict only magical and character Strength
bonuses, if any. Slashing weapons inflict those
bonuses, and the following normal damage per
hit:

* Dagger: | point.

* Short sword and hand axe: |d2 points.

* Long sword: |d4 points.

* Bastard sword and edged polearm: |d6
points.

* Battle axe/broad sword/halberd: 1d8 points.

* Two-handed sword: |d10 points.

passengers and moving at a rate of 30—until the
uscr flies it at an altitude above 200 feet. Then the
carpet rises slightly, stalls, and begins a final
dive. Unless they have some means of preventing
the fall, those on the carpet suffer 20d6 hit points
impact damage and must make a saving throw vs.
death magic to avoid instant and unpleasant
deaths.

This magical rug is similar to a rug of smothering
but functions on the command word of the owner.
It will wrap up any who stand upon it (other than
the owner) and smother them, rendering them
unconscious (but not dead) in 1d4+2 rounds.
Creatures that do not need to breathe are
unharmed, but unable to move, Jt requires an ani-
mate object, hold plant, ot wish to escape the car-
pet, or strength of 19+ to unwrap it (it unwraps at
the command of the owner as well). The carpet
may be destroyed by inflicting 25 hp on it (AC

are determined by rolling percentile dice and con-
sulting the table below. Each carpet has its own
command word to activate it—if the device is
within voice range, the command word always

manding the carpet to do anything at all, is para-
lyzed (saving throw applicable), causing all
aboard to stretch out along its length. It then
begins to radiate a temperature of 375° F. and
continues until the victim is well done. Needless
to say, the smell of frying human (or halfling, elf,
dwarf, gnome or half-orc) may attract any mon-
sters in the area who are fond of such delicacies.

Leonardo’s magical carpet is of an unusual size—it
is a mere 3 feet wide, but fully 12 feet long. This
unusual size allows 6 fully equipped individuals to
travel in single file on the carpet. The narrow
design, however, allows the carpet to travel at a
speed of 42, despite the size and the weight of its
burden. Leonardo uses the carpet to transport other
wizards and himself, flying fast and low to the
ground. Thus, they are able to catch enemies off
guard and either attack them magically with sur-
prise or get away from them without being followed.

Indistinguishable from a rug of smothering, this
carpet forms an emotional attachment with any-
one who picks it up. After that, it is always found
somewhere about the person or his or her gear,
worrying about how he or she eats, constantly
naging about how he or she takes care of his or
her clothes, and fussing when he or she goes out
in the rain without galoshes. This is all the more
likely to be embarrassing when one remembers
that the standard rug of smothering is generally
used only by assassins.

as a rug of smothering, entrapping any creature
up to ogre-size that steps on it. A rug of wel-
come can elongate itself, becoming hard and
strong as steel—maximum length, 27 feet by 2.
In this form, it can serve as a bridge or a barri-
cade. In this latter form it 1s AC 0 and takes 100

Cart

Carts are wooden vehicles with one or two pairs of
wooden wheels. Each pair of wheels is connected
by a wooden pole that serves as an axle. In front of
the cart is a second, longer pole that is attached to a
harness of a single draft animal or a team of ani-
mals. The bed of the cart occasionally has a frame-
work that helps keep larger cargo in place.

of Convenience

The Book of Marvelous Magic
This cart, which moves at 60 feet per round, can
be used normally. However, it may also be hitched
to one or two horses or mules, and then immedi-

. ately unhitched; the cart remains in position as if

the animals were still in place. If the animals are
ridden behind the cart, it moves as if being pulled
normally. Its capacity is 400 pounds with a single
horse behind it, 800 pounds with two; however,
the encumbrance is not counted against the
mounts. *

of Decks
**XP Value:** 1,100 **GP Value:** 5,500

If the command word for this cart is spoken after
the cart has been loaded normally, all its contents
vanish into an extradimensional space, leaving
the cart apparently empty. The cart can then be
refilled, and the command word spoken again;
the contents disappear once more, only to be
replaced by the original load. Like a cargo vessel,
the cart’s two “decks” can be loaded and unloaded
normally, but the cart’s total encumbrance limits
(400 or 800 pounds) still apply. The cart is useful
for carrying valuable cargo while appearing to
carry only ordinary goods.

Mouse Cart
**XP Value:** 3,500 **GP Value:** 17,500
Tome of Magic

A mouse cart resembles a miniature wooden cart
with two wooden wheels and a tiny, leather har-
ness. When a normal mouse is secured in the har-
ness, the cart expands to the size of a normal cart
(about 5 square feet). The mouse retains its nor-
mal size, but is enchanted, acquiring the ability to
pull the cart and 250 pounds of cargo at a move-
ment rate of 12.

As long as the mouse remains in the harness, it
is compelled to obey all oral commands of the
person who placed the animal in harness. The
mouse will run forward, stop, turn, and obey all
similar commands; it does not attack or take any
action that a mouse is normally incapable of per-
forming. No other creature attached to the mouse
cart can activate the device’s magical properties.
A character or other creature polymorphed or oth-
erwise transformed into a mouse can activate the
cart’s magic.

Carven Oak
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** —
The Minrothad Guilds
The Verdier Dan of elves left their clan tree
behind when they emigrated from their home-
land. Some say that tree was the inspiration for
Iisundal’s later creation, the tree of life, familiar
to so many mainland elves. However this may be,
the Verdier elves arrived in the Minrothad Islands
without any relic at all. Whatever sprig or off-
shoot of the clan tree went with them had per-
ished during their long travels.

When these elves isolated themselves from
their aquatic elf kin in the early days on Alfeisle,
they withdrew into the forests, heartsick for the
woodlands they had left behind. Alawyn Verdier
was the keeper at that time, although no relic
existed for her and her assistants to guard. Dis-
contented with a useless existence, Alawyn and a
few brave companions went on a quest to find a
new relic for the Verdier Wood elves.

The keeper and her followers were gone for
five years, After adventures that took them to the
planes of the Immortals, Alawyn and her friends
returned, much aged and fewer in number, but
with a relic (of sorts) for their isolated clan. They
had brought with them the carven oak, a powerful
artifact given to the wood elves by the immortal

they follow.

The carven oak is a life-sized carving of an
oak tree. It stands 30 feet tall and is made of solid
wood—of a species not even the forest elves can
identify. The trunk and branches are carved to
look like bark, the leaves resemble leaves down to
its finely detailed veins, Besides the leaf-covered
branches, the carven oak was made with 100 sep-
arate branchlets standing starkly alone.

The carven oak stands in a heavily guarded,
sacred grove not far from Verdun on Alfeisle.
Mahogany grows in this island forest, but the car-
ven oak stands alone in a clearing 200 feet across.
The artificial tree is deeply rooted, originally
with the base of its trunk set deeply in the ground.
It appears that the trunk has actually taken root in
the past century. Although the rest of the artifact
is clearly dead wood, its keepers are hopeful that
it may be turning into a living tree.

The carven oak is a greater artifact created by
an Immortal of the Sphere of Time. It possesses
none of the powers of traditional elf clan relics,
although its powers are great enough in their own
right. Only the current keeper, Rewen Verdier,
and his senior assistant, Hani Oliwn, understand
all the powers, uses, and dangers of the artifact.

The artifact is charged with 500 power points.
It recharges at the rate of 20 points per turn, or
120 an hour. The artifact has the following pow-
ers: Control plants, control animals, turn wood,

plant, warp wood, create normal object, wish,

Handicaps and Penalties: Handicaps are per-
manent effects; penalties wear off when the dura-
tion has expired or the artifact is no longer
possessed.

Handicaps: The junior immortal Oleyan is
imbedded in the carven oak and bound to serve
the wood elves, the result of a dispute he lost with
the creator of the artifact. This is unknown to any
but the keeper himself. It is because of Oleyan’s
presence that the carven oak has begun to take
root. He has 1,500 years of service left, or until
the artifact is destroyed. Oleyan helps anyone
who comes to destroy the carven oak, for he has
long since become bored with this existence. He
can communicate telepathically with anyone
touching the carven oak, but does not do so
unless he senses that person may be sympathetic
to his desire for freedom.

When control plants, speak with plants, or
pass plant is used, there is a 20% chance that the

~~, Carven Oak f

user loses 1 hit point permanently.

If two powers are used in a single day, the user
suffers -50% to attack ranges for missiles and
spells for the next 24 hours.

Penalties: When a wish is invoked, there is a
90% chance that the user dies, There is no saving
throw, and this effect does not reverse itself if the
artifact is destroyed.

When using find path, control animals, or cre-
ate normal object, there is a 60% chance that the
user becomes compelled to serve the wood elves
as if under a geas. This does not occur if the char-
acter is already serving the elves with his or her
use of these powers. When warp wood or cure
serious wounds is used, there is a 5% chance for
the user to age 15 years.

For each power used, there is a 50% chance
that the user’s Dexterity drops by -3 for one day.

If a power costing more than 50 power points is
used, there is a 50% chance that the user’s next
saving throw is penalized by -1d12.

Activation: These powers can be activated in
two ways. The most common is to touch the car-
ven oak and inyoke the name of the power. The
second way is to break off one of the leafless
branchlets of the artifact. At any later time, the
user can break that branchlet in half and invoke
the name of the desired power. The power then
takes effect as if the user were touching the arti-
fact. If a branchlet is broken without a power
being named, it is not wasted; each lesser length
retains its power until one artifact ability is
invoked. This ability can only be used once per
branchlet, no matter how many times it is broken.

This latter method of activation in effect makes
each branchlet a one-time magical device that can
be used at any distance from the carven oak. The
branchlets are given on rare occasions to adven-
turers or heroes working in the cause of the
Verdier clan. When the keeper gives a branchlet
for this purpose, he tells the recipient what spell
effect the branchlet has. He does not mention that
the branchlet can invoke any power, nor what the
full range of powers are. If a person receives
more than one branchlet, they are painted or tied
with colored string so that the supposedly sepa-
rate spell effects can be told apart. There are cur-
rently 82 branchlets remaining on the carven oak.
Once they are gone, they cannot be replaced. No
other pieces of wood from this artifact have the
same remote power effect.

These casks appear to be the same as any water
container found aboard a ship. Each contains a
special enchantment that causes the cask to fill
with five gallons of fresh spring water once a day.
If the cask is damaged or its cover is lost, no
water is created. The casks fill themselves and do
not operate using command words.

Created by a priestal order of Eldath, everfull
casks fulfill a multitude of purposes within
Realmspace. Ships with these casks need never
worry about short water supplies or foul water
during long voyages. Planetary colonies with
water shortages are aided by reliable sources of
water. And the Eldathian priests who create these
wonderful items raise money through the sale of
everfull casks to finance building the temples of
Eldath throughout civilized space. This money
also brings more of Eldath’s priests into space,
thus leading to the spread of her religion. It is
widely proclaimed by her priests that Eldath’s
word will flow across the stars, and the goddess
of the singing waters will be found everywhere in
her water and in her worship. As of yet, Eldath’s
worship is still limited to Realmspace, but her
followers are growing steadily—her priests’
words may yet come true.

Note: These casks will not work efficiently
outside of Realmspace. Each cask only produces
five gallons of water per week outside of the
crystal sphere of the Realms, because of Eldath’s
limited influence beyond Realmspace.

A breathtakingly beautiful, normal-sized casket
of clear crystal with a lid mounted on hinges of
gold, this device has trapped within it a minor
form of air elemental who will act as a scout and
spy for anyone who knows the magic word of

box is opened, lest the elemental fly out and
return to its native plane. The elemental can be
commanded for a total of two hours before it
must return to the box for a full day.

The elemental is invisible and does not
engage in combat, but it is intelligent and able
to communicate in a high, lilting whisper. It
cannot draw maps, but it can describe what it
has seen. Though it cannot distinguish fine
details (it may see medium infantry rather than
heavy, or spears instead of pikes), it can provide
basic information of what and who it saw
(infantry, but maybe cavalry, gnomes, but it
could be ogres). If the casket breaks (which
occurs if an item saving throw for crystal glass
fails), the elemental is free to return to its home
plane (MV FL 24; AC 0; hp 24).

Castle

Through a long, arcane process, a complete castle
can sometimes be built on a floating cloud. Such
a castle is worth at least 30,000 gp and could be
worth millions (see The Castle Guide). Experi-
ence is never awarded for finding and using a
cloud castle. The award for actually building one
is up to the DM; 1 to 10 XP per 100 gp spent on
construction would suit most campaigns.

Cloud
**XP Value:** Varies **GP Value:** Varies
DRAGON Magazine 39

Few things in the realm of fantasy inspire a sense
of wonder equal to that of a castle nestled among
the clouds, serene and (perhaps) peaceful, com-
manding a view of the country below such as few
people ever see. Cloud castles are usually inhab-
ited by high-level priests or wizards, cloud or
storm giants, titans, silver or gold dragons, or
other lofty, powerful beings. They are very rare,
and their creation is a long and complicated
process.

A high-level wizard is usually required to con-
struct a cloud castle, and he or she should have a
large force of men and monsters to complete the
task. First, a cloud must be found that meets the
wizard’s requirements for size, shape, and alti-
tude—an area of little rain or one rich in cumulus
clouds is preferred. Altitudes above two miles
should be avoided for lack of breathable air. A
flying carpet, broom of flying, or similar spell
must be used to give the wizard a stable platform
from which to cast spells.

Next, the wizard must summon an air elemen-
tal (16 HD) and command it to shape the cloud
into the desired form. Elementals are not hostile
when informed of the purpose of their summon-
ing, and willingly cooperate with the wizard.
Shaping the cloud involves flattening a space for
the castle, adding decorations (of somewhat
vague form) to the cloud as the wizard sees fit,
and preventing precipitation. Within one turn
after the air elemental is dismissed, the wizard
must cast wish and contro! weather on the cloud
mass to permanently maintain its form and stabil-
ity. A second wish may be used to anchor the
cloud over a particular location, so it doesn’t
drift.

Now the wizard must start casting walls of
force to form the construction base of the castle;

Cloud Castle

nn em

this could be a lengthy and tedious process,
depending on the size of the castle the wizard has
in mind. Obviously, the higher the wizard’s level,
the bigger the walls of force, which are laid in an
alternating tile pattern on the flattened base of the
cloud. Immediately after each force wall is cre-
ated, a permanency spell must be thrown on it so
that it doesn’t fade. When finished, another wish
is cast over the whole to ensure the surface is
level, interlocking, and cannot be dispelled
except by acts of greater powers. This entire
process may take days or weeks and the wizard
must be fully absorbed in the project.

When this is done, the wizard casts a wish and
a reverse gravity and another permanency spell
upon the cloud mass, so that now it will support
any weight placed upon it, even the weight of vast
amounts of masonry and stone This step may
only be circumvented if the wizard or the creature
the castle is being built for (a cloud or storm
giant, or a titan) is a worshiper of Crius, titan of
Density and Gravity. A great sacrifice made to
Crius (DM’s option) may induce him to work on
the cloud castle base for one hour, after which it
will support nearly any weight.

At this point, the lucky wizard may start con-
struction of the stronghold with whatever materi-
als he or she deems necessary. If large blocks of
quarried stone are to be carried to the site, then a
retinue of cloud and storm giants may be helpful
(perhaps payment is in the form of a co-owner-
ship of the castle). Otherwise, variations of
Tenser s floating disc at high level may suffice, or
teleport, or wish. Once the castle is built, a final
wish is used to absolutely lock the castle to the
cloud—the deed is done. If allowed then to drift,
it will do so in a random direction, at a speed
never exceeding 10 feet an hour.

A few final notes. Remember that, unless a
water tower or garden is included, the inhabitants
may well have to hunt frequently or starve, as
dragons and giants must do. High-level priests
may provide food, but this isn’t recommended for
longer periods of time. The walls of force are
translucent, so if a transparent floor is desired,
allow for the cloud to be cleared away underneath
the designated area; otherwise, cover the floor to
prevent vertigo. Glasstee/ and similar spells may
provide windows to enhance the view, and
remember that if the castle drifts freely it also
rotates slowly.

Note that if a cloud castle descends to within

100 feet of the ground, there is a 5% cumulative
chance per round that, regardless of the spells
used to protect it, the wall of force spells on the
base cease to function, bringing the whole to the
earth as precipitation. If the cloud strikes a moun-
taintop, the base is not dispelled, but there may be
severe structural damage to the castle, as an
earthquake spell.

Cloud II

**XP Value:** Varies **GP Value:** Varies
The Book of Wondrous Inventions
Clouds are normally too vaporous and imperma-
nent for any but the most insubstantial of crea-
tures to make their dwellings. However, millennia
ago, a being of an unknown species, traditionally
called Gibberlin the Aerifier, made the discovery
that when the blood of a storm deity is spilled on
a cloud, the cloud changes. It becomes permanent
and semi-solid, never fading, never completely
evaporating. The cloud’s appearance is unchanged
to human eyes, but aerial entities (such as cloud
giants) can recognize such altered clouds at a
glance,

A cloud castle looks like a cloud from below. It
moves with the wind, is white and fluffy—the
only real difference is that it never dissipates,
although its edges can change shape. However,
anyone flying above it, and looking down, can
view the castle, its gardens, perhaps even the
forests, towns, and landscapes on the cloud’s sur-
face.

Construction: Manufacturing one’s own per-
manent cloud is quite difficult, since godsblood is
nearly impossible to obtain. Fortunately, storm
deities are mostly a violent bunch. Their immor-
tal ichor is frequently spilled onto clouds, so a
cloud castle builder need only check out likely
prospects until locating a permanent, ichor-satu-
rated cloud.

Boarding one of these clouds is easy; flying
creatures can simply land atop the foggy mass.
Landbound giants must wait until the cloud
bumps into a mountain, then climb aboard while
it is still caught on the pinnacle.

Once aboard the cloud, it must be prepared for
construction. The cloud-stuff itself is soft and
fluffy, and while it can support enormous weight,
it is quite unsuitable for use as building material.
Fog cutters and fog tongs are needed to dig the
castle’s foundation and carve the cloudy land-
scape into the desired shapes of hills, Jakes,

Cloud Castle II

"7am animes

rivers, and valleys.

Fog cutters are nonmagica] shears used to snip
out cubes of cloud from the surrounding mist.
The shears must be long enough to chop out the
largest cube possible, and they must be sharp, as
must any shears intended to cut soft materials.
Most fog cutters are sized for cloud giants, and
much too large for humans to wield. Fog tongs
are enormous, nonmagical pincers resembling
oversized ice-tongs. They are used to grip blocks
of cloud and move them about. Often a rope is
attached to the tongs, so the hunk of cloud can be
towed, floating at a distance above and behind the
user. When a great number of cloud cubes must
be moved, the easiest procedure is to net them
and tow them with a long rope. If landscaping is
to be done, grooves must be cut out for rivers, and
depressions for lakes and ponds. A few holes are
usually cut entirely through the cloud to permit
the threading of chains.

The builder of the castle needs one or more
huge, iron dredges, attached by colossal lengths
of rope and chain to the cloud. These dredges are
lowered to the ground as the cloud floats by, to
scoop up dirt and lift it to the surface of the cloud
where it is spread to provide surface for gardens
and trees. Plants and animals may be caught in
the dredge as well; in that case, the better plants
are used as seed stock to start gardens, and the
animals are eaten or bred. Cloud giants, having
little concern for human needs, usually scoop up
only the best farmland. Some giants use their
dredges to scoop up entire human houses, using
the inhabitants as serfs to work their cloudtop
farmland.

Building the castle itself is a bit more arduous.
Once the foundation is prepared, the builder, usu-
ally a giant, must be lowered on a rope or chain to
a good source of stone. The cloud should be
anchored so it won’t float off, and slabs of stone
are quarried in the normal fashion. Of course,
with a giant doing this work, it takes less time
than for human quarry workers. Buckets are low-
ered from the cloud to raise the quarried stone,
then the giants return to the cloud and construct
the castle.

A cloud castle is inexpensive, since every-
thing used is of natural materials (or stolen),
but it may take as long as an ordinary castle to
build. Fog cutters, fog tongs, dredges, anchors,
and chains must be made to order, costing an

average of 500 gp each; the dredges, chains,
916

 

265

%,
Catapult

and buckets average 5,000 gp each. These items
may be obtained more cheaply from giant or
dwarven blacksmiths. Some giants simply walk
into a small town, glower at the locals, and
order them to build a house-sized dredge
equipped with a mile or two of chain—or the
giants will devastate the town.

Statistics:

¢ Size: Larger than an ordinary castle.

¢ Structural points: As an ordinary castle or
stronger. Cloud castles are usually larger,
stronger, and cruder than normal castles, hav-
ing been built by and for giants.

¢« Construction tools: Fog tongs and fog cutters
are usually about 10 feet long and weighing
well over 200 pounds. The dredges are at least
20 feet across, and weigh several tons. The
anchor need only be a simple boulder attached
to a long rope.

* Weight-bearing capacity: 50 pounds per
square foot, per foot of cloud’s thickness.
Thus, a cloud 40 feet thick can support 20,000
pounds per square foot, sufficient for most
building purposes.

* Movement: At the speed and in the direction
of the prevailing wind.

Cloud castles are almost self-sufficient. Their
gardens and animal life provide enough food to
support many inhabitants, and if the fare ever
gets dreary, the inhabitants need only lower a
dredge to scoop up an orchard or a barn full of
cattle. Waste materials are easily dumped over-
board.

It does not rain very often on cloud castles,
since they float at altitudes equal to or higher than
those of many rain clouds. When drought threat-
ens, a bucket is lowered to a pond and water
scooped up and dumped in one of the cloud
castle’s lakes. The gardens and farms on the cloud
must be irrigated, and that chore is done by what-
ever serfs the giants have captured.

A cloud castle makes an ideal raiding base.
By its very nature, it provides excellent camou-
flage. It is almost continually on the move,
rarely remaining behind to suffer retribution.
When the castle drifts over a likely prospect,
such as a wealthy citadel or a prosperous ham-
let, the giants simply lower ropes and chains,
then swarm down to rob the area blind. The
cloud’s motion can be controlled slightly by the
use of huge bellows and fans, so it can be made

”" ceseeanentinenerininiesteesneeenereeeeeenneel

to float directly over a ground castle, enabling
the giants to bypass the fortress’s outer
defenses. If necessary, giants subdue defenders
by dropping large boulders, tree trunks, dead
horses, and similar debris.

While the cloud never completely dries out or
disintegrates, its edges do change shape, and any
structure built too near the edge may be damaged
or even fall over the side. In addition, the cloud
changes size with the prevailing moisture in the
air. When traveling over a steaming jungle, the
cloud swells, becoming much larger than usual.
When over arid regions, it may shrink to a third
its normal size.

Cloud castles are at the whim of the winds. If
becalmed, the inhabitants may be unable to find
loot, food, or water for weeks. They also suffer
water shortages if the castle is blown over an
ocean or desert. Castles are sometimes attacked
by flying monsters, creatures that are both more
rare and more fearsome than earthbound beasts.
Dragons, wyverns, and griffins can be difficult to
drive away, even for giants.

The vain, immortal giant Hymir created this
device to produce vast amounts of superb ale for
his own enjoyment and for his friends, Thor and
the other Immortals. Its powers can, however, be
used in other ways.

It is a black iron kettle with a handle, of a type
normally found in kitchens. It is about 18 inches
across and a foot high.

The kettle is inactive when it is found. It is
activated by filling it with water, heating it over a
fire, and then reading the powers and command
words in the rising bubbles with a read magic
spell. However, it is impossible to exactly dupli-
cate Hymir’s formula for the flavor of his ale,
unless a sample of his ale has been tasted.

Each power is triggered by command words.
The user may give the commands from up to 10
feet away. However, each power applies only to
the contents of the kettle.

Suggested Powers: (All abilities are cast at
20th level.)

* Create poison (Range: touch, The only poison
this will create is alcohol.)

* Container (Duration six hours; Capacity
1,000 cubic feet).

* Create water

* Change tastes (Affects 40 meals or 20 cubic
feet.)

Suggested Handicap: Fumbling—whenever
the user attacks another with either a weapon or
spell, he or she has 1 chance in 6 of fumbling the
attack.

Suggested Penalty: Memory penalties. Spell-
casters—after memorizing spells, the user imme-
diately forgets one spell of each odd-numbered
spell level (up to one each of Ist-, 3rd-, 5th-, 7th-,
and 9th-level spells). Nonspellcasters—the user
immediately forgets how to use one weapon.

Tome of Magic

Mordom’s cauldron of air is a round pot about 2
feet in diameter, weighing 60 pounds. There are
two handles on either side of the pot and a com-
partment built like a small shelf underneath. The
compartment can be filled with wood or coal to
heat the cauldron.

Although the device is heavy and bulky, the
cauldron is valuable for characters planning an
expedition to a place with little or no air. The
cauldron functions as an air generator. To operate
the device, the cauldron is filled with water and a
fire is lit in the compartment. When the water
boils, vapor is released. The air from the vapor
creates a bubble of breathable air with a 10-foot
radius, centered on the cauldron.

The water must not be allowed to spill out of

the cauldron and the fire must be kept burning.

DUNGEON Magazine 21

This magical item was created by druids of the
deity Dagda in imitation of the deity’s own, more
powerful, device. In addition, the cauldron of
plenty is cursed to bring harm to any person who
obtains it by violence, since it was created to be
used without charge by all who wish to partake of
its benefits. The only exception to the curse is if
the cauldron is obtained by a druidic follower of
Dagda, in which case the curse is not activated.

The curse is suitably vague and slow in effect,
but very certain; the DM should take a free hand
in designing its consequences. Three to six
months after the cauldron is taken by violence
from its previous owner, the new owner will be
attacked by a comparatively powerful enemy in a
fight to the death. The enemy should be a single
monster or NPC, or a group of beings; the reason
for the attack could vary widely, but it always
concerns retaliation for some perceived offense.
If the first attack fails, the next attack comes in
1d4+1 months; if that fails, another occurs in 1d4
months, then 1d3 months, 1d2 months, one
month, three weeks, two weeks, one week, and
then every day from six days to one. Finally, the
new owner is attacked on a daily basis by some
new and powerful force, until the cauldron is
given up or the owner is slain.

In its normal function as a provider of large
quantities of food, the cauldron operates only at
the command of beings whose alignment has a
neutral element (true neutral, neutral good or evil,
or lawful or chaotic neutral). It does not function
for those of other alignments.

Once per day, when the proper command
words are spoken, the cauldron produces beef,
mutton, or pork in quantities sufficient to feed
5d10 people. It never produces fewer than five
portions, nor does it produce more food than that
required for the immediate party. The cauldron
produces only one type of meat, once per day.
The command words are:

Censer

A censer is a container used to burn incense. The
censer has a base that allows the container to
stand by itself, a central bow] that holds the smol-

chains, spaced equally around the upper lid of the
central bowl, allow the priest or wizard to hold
the censer as it smokes, sending its magical
aroma into the air.

an odd effect on all within 60 feet. Those affected
become unable to explain any detailed action in
combat. The victims cannot aim at a specific por-
tion of a target such as a tentacle. When any vic-

expires, without bleeding, moaning, or perform-
ing any other sort of normal dying activity. The
effect is identical to that produced by game vio-
lins (See Stringed Instruments).

This perforated, metal vessel is typically (75%)
made of electrum, but may be formed of any
precious metal. If it is filled with incense and lit,
the vapors from the incense permeate a 10-foot
radius after one round, and increase by 10 feet
per round thereafter until reaching a limit, 70
feet in radius after the seventh round. The effect
of the vapors depends on what sort of character
or creature ignited the incense. (This may be
someone other than the owner of the censer.) If
the lighting was done by a member of a spell-
casting class or a creature with those abilities,
all wizard spells cast by someone who Is within
the vapors are treated as if cast by a wizard of
18th level. If the lighting is done by a character
or creature with no spellcasting or innate spell-
like abilities, then all wizard spells cast by

someone within the vapors will take effect as if

obtained spell-user abilities is considered a
spellcaster for purposes of this determination.

All forms of magic that are equivalent to any
wizard spell (such as a monster’s innate spell-
like abilities or priestal spells that directly dupli-
cate wizard spells) are affected by the magic of
the censer of thaumaturgy. Psionic powers,
magical items, and other magical effects are not
altered. The high level effect of the censer’s
magic gives any spell cast the range, duration,
and effectiveness as if cast by a wizard of the
18th level, but does not allow the casting of any
spell the caster did not already possess. The low
level version of this magic limits the spells
usable within the vapors to magic that is avail-
able to a 5th-level caster; in other words, noth-
ing higher than a 3rd-level spell can be
successfully cast. Any attempt to use a spell of
4th level or higher simply fails, and the spell is
wasted. As with the high level version, no caster
can use a spell to which he or she would not nor-
mally be entitled.

The censer burns for 3d4 turns unless deliber-
ately extinguished. A gust of wind spell, the
approach of a wind walker, or the presence of
similar air currents that markedly affect the
vapors will disperse them and end the effect.
When the censer goes out or is extinguished, the
vapors persist for 1d4 rounds thereafter before
losing their power.

Chain

A chain is a series of interlocking metal rings that
form a long strand. Chains are commonly used to
bind prisoners, haul cargo, and connect anchors

one activating command, but a few function auto-
matically.

DRAGON Magazine 145
Hundreds of years ago, there lived a great wizard
named Danleor who created dozens of sets of
magical dungeon chains, which he used to con-
fine his numerous and unusual enemies. Some of
these enchanted shackles have survived the cen-
turies to the present.

Individual sets of chains vary in power and
effectiveness; the stronger ones are noticeably
thicker and sturdier than the weaker ones. The
iron chains and shackles are built to confine any
creature from hill giant to halfling in size, and
Danleor’s dungeon chains weigh so heavily on
captives that they are almost totally immobilized.
To find the strength of the chains discovered, roll
on the table below.

Danleor’s dungeon chains are much too
heavy to be thrown or otherwise used as weap-
ons. Anyone, aside from the chains’ captive,
may open the magic shackles, if the command
word is known. In some of Danleor’s ancient
records, which are now kept by an isolated clan
of elves, there is mention of strange dungeon
chains that are particularly effective against
undead, and others which are actually sized to
hold larger giants. To date, however, none of
these have been discovered.

Roll Strength of Danleor’s Dungeon Chains

Ivory Chain of Pao
**GP Value:**

 

 

**XP Value:**
Book of Artifacts

This artifact has a very distinctive appearance, an
ivory chain whose links are carved in the fashion
of men with arms outstretched. Each link is cun-
ningly made so that the hands of one figure inter-
lock with the next in line. Unlike metal chains,
the links here are not closed loops and it should
be possible to unhook individual links. However,
the chain will not fall apart. The chain is approxi-
mately 12 feet long.

The ivory chain of Pao has a long and colorful
history in the lands of the east, but it is virtually
unknown to western sages. This is the tale,
albeit abbreviated, as it is known to those east-
ern scholars. Only those western sages with con-
tacts in the distant orient would know anything
of this tale.

The early history of the chain is very vague.
Common tradition holds that it was fashioned in
the Age of Red Earth by Master Pao, the Lesser
Immortal of Mount Yei, and given to the Nine
First Emperors, who ruled the empire jointly. The
chain, it is said, was to symbolize their unity and
the harmony they brought to all civilized people
(meaning, of course, the empire).

Unfortunately, it brought tragedy. One night,
an audacious thief slipped into the treasury and
stole the chain in the seventh year of the rule of
the Nine. (Some say this thief was inspired by
Monkey, the Lord of Mischief; others, by an evil
god.) Shortly after that, turmoil grew in the
southern realms of the empire as a new cult rose
to challenge the Emperors.

It was at this time that the Nine Emperors with-
drew to heaven, leaving the empire in the hands
of the First Dynasty. As the evil cult in the south
continued to grow, the emperor sought the secret
of its destruction. Finally he and his poet-brother
went south to challenge the cult.

It was there that they discovered that Nan Kung
Chi, the high priest of the Black Leopard Cult,
had the ivory chain. With it the priest had bound
the great leopard-fiend of the cult and forced it to
his will. Guided by the wisdom of his brother, the
Emperor Chin shattered the chain with a single
stroke of his spear, thus ending the terror of the
leopard cult.

Many would have assumed this to be the end of
the ivory chain’s power, but Master Pao had been
more cunning than that. It is said that the chain

~, Ivory Chain of Pao

vanished with the parting of a single link, only to
reform itself later. This must certainly be true, for
the chain figured into another great event—the
fall of the copper fiend of Tros.

If little was known of the Black Leopard Cult,
even less has been recorded of the copper fiend.
It is known that this monster rose to great power
in the northwestern reaches of the empire, seizing
several provinces for its own. These it ruled with
absolute authority and terror for many decades.
Finally the horrors of the fiend became so great
that the emperor called for heroes to help regain
his lands. Wo Mai and his companions, loyal to
their emperor, undertook the dangerous task. It is
unknown just how they overthrew the copper
fiend, but the accepted stories say the ivory chain
of Pao was instrumental in binding the creature
and bringing it back to the imperial court. There
it was imprisoned in the acorn of Wo Mai (see
Acorn of Wo Mai).

After this great event the chain drops out of all
accounts of recorded history. Some scholars say it
was ground into dust and forged into the acorn
that holds the copper fiend. Others think it
remained in the imperial treasuries until the fall
of the Hai Dynasty, when the Sixth Emperor went
to invade a neighboring land. There it was sup-
posedly lost (along with the Sixth Emperor) when
the invasion fleet sank in a great storm. The story
continues that the chain was recovered by a for-
eign navigator named O’ Rourke, who was in the
employ of the dead emperor. It is quite possible
that he carried it back to the lands of the west—or
perhaps he did not.

The ivory chain of Pao is not a particularly
powerful artifact for common adventuring. Its
powers affect only Outerplanar creatures, so,
unless these figure into the campaign, the chain is
going to be nothing more than an interesting
curiosity. However, should a great Outerplanar
threat appear...

The DM should build the adventure around the
chain’s powers. The obvious possibility is that
something awful and of great power has broken
into the Prime Material Plane and the chain is
necessary to overcome it.

The player characters could, for various rea-
sons, journey to the Outer Planes where they
would need the chain to capture some powerful
being. Perhaps it is needed for a powerful spell:
perhaps the task is a geas imposed by a cunning

lich or payment to a high priest for services ren-

\
dered. The group might even do something this
dangerous merely to impress a powerful lord. A
great king, caliph, or emperor would certainly
think highly of heroes who presented a powerful
fiend humbled by a simple ivory chain.

Furthermore, since the chain can be taken
apart, the simple business of discovering it can
become quite complicated. The DM could intro-
duce the artifact slowly. The group might find a
single link as part of a treasure hoard, and later
find others—without explanation. Only after an
ample length of chain is assembled might there
be clues to its purpose.

Invoked Powers: The chain can be used in one
of two ways, either as a whole or in individual
links. When the whole chain is wrapped around
the wrists, neck, ankles, or waist (or the equiva-
lent) of an Outer-planar creature, the creature is
automatically bound. Bound creatures must
absolutely obey the commands of the owner of
the chain, who must hold one end of it while giv-
ing commands. Although it seems extremely
fragile, the bound creature is utterly helpless
against the chain’s might, nor can it use its powers
except at the bidding of its master.

If one knows the right way to twist and slide
the figures, the links can be unlocked from each
other. Once the 48-link chain is broken, it loses
all power to bind. Any individual link can be
thrown against a creature, with all of the effects
of a holy word spell. Links hurled vanish instantly.

Curse: Each day that the chain is used to bind
a creature, there is a 5% chance it will break and
vanish at once. Newly freed creatures are usually
quite eager to extract vengeance on their former
masters in horrible and imaginative ways. Fur-
thermore, Outer-planar creatures will send
earthly agents against the chain’s owner.

Suggested Means of Destruction:

* A secret method of joining each link so that
the hands do not touch the chain must be used.

* Each link matches a living hero or heroine.
When all are dead, the chain crumbles.

* It must be given to an elephant-god, who shat-
ters the ivory.

less than a wish. The magic of the chair allows
It to be dimly seen by those on the Prime Mate-

way; this is the origin of many strange stories.
There is a 25% chance per use that an ethereal
creature notes the chair’s passage and gives
chase. The armchair moves so quickly, however,
that ethereal creatures can only catch it 25% of
the time. When it reaches its destination, the
armchair and its rider rematerialize. The chair

victim must also make a saving throw vs. spell
with a -4 penalty to the roll or be stuck fast in the
armchair. The chair and victim may be carried
about, but any attacks on a seated victim gain a
+4 bonus to attack rolls, and the victim’s Dexter-

of Continual Water
**XP Value:** 240 **GP Value:** 2,400
Realmspace

The chalice of continual water, when bent to the
lips, releases pure, cool water for the imbiber to
drink, The chalice continues to produce water as
long as it is not standing upright. This is the item
that causes the continuous stream of water in the
castle located in the center of the Tears of Selune.
The chalice can produce one mouthful of water
every second.

of Detection

**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 5,000
The Book of Marvelous Magic
This cup appears and functions as a chalice of
colors. In addition, however, if it comes within 30
feet of poison, the water in it turns a murky
green. Poisonous monsters, traps, arrows, and
gases all trigger this response. After use, the
water remains green and the chalice must be
refilled in order to detect again; however, any
drinkable water may be used. The chalice detects
poison three times per day at most. Once each
week, the chalice can be commanded to produce
an antidote; the green water then turns pink and
becomes a potion that negates the effects of the
poison detected. When consumed, the antidote
prevents any of that particular poison from affect-
ing the user for one turn (treat as a successful sav-
ing throw).

This magical chalice does not possess a magica]
aura as would be expected of a magical item. It
does, however, exhibit a large amount of magical
energy whenever a fluid is poured into it. The chal-
ice automatically purifies any liquid it contains. It
removes all bacterial and viral infestations, as well
as removing poisons and alcoholic contents (wine
becomes juice). If the purified liquid is drunk, it
grants the imbiber total refreshment, and com-
pletely fulfills the body’s needs for liquid, regard-
less of the dehydration of the drinker.

The magic of the chalice also puts the imbiber
totally at ease, both personally and with those
with whom the user comes in contact. Enemies
who share a drink from this chalice have no
shared grievances for one full week. The chalice
heals no damage except insanity, and that of all
types, even genetic madness, by properly realign-
ing the neural synapses in the brain. The drinker
feels total communion with everything for one
full week. A drinker’s alignment is not perma-
nently affected by the chalice.

This vessel of literary fame is supposedly the cup
at the Last Supper, carried to England by Joseph

and spiritual sustenance for the life of the custo-
dian. The grail can create food and water as
though cast by a 20th-level spellcaster once per
day. Any food or drink poured or dipped into the
grail is purified as though a purify food and drink
was Cast.

Legends & Lore
The holy grail is a sacred relic that, legend has it,
was brought from Rome to Britain by Joseph of
Arimathea. It was lost in Britain until Arthur’s
knights set out on their quest. A large chalice, it
appears to be made of pure gold, though in reality
it is crafted from wood. In order to even see the
holy grail, one must be of Lawful Good align-
ment and above evil temptations. Only a knight of
saintly virtue may actually touch or drink from

the holy grail.

When a worthy knight drinks from the grail,
its magical powers are activated. At this point,
the chalice has the following powers, which it
exercises automatically as the need exists—cre-
ate food and water (for all those who can see
it), heal, neutralize poison, remove curse (for
anybody who can see it) and plant growth over
any barren area into which it is taken. Once a
saintly knight drinks from the grail, it disap-
pears and is again lost until found by another
worthy knight.

of Identification
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 5,000
The Book of Marvelous Magic

This cup appears and functions as a chalice of
colors but may also be used to identify potions of
all types. When a potion is poured into it, the
name of the potion appears as misty letters in the
next color change. A read magic spell is required
to decipher the letters. The chalice must be care-
fully washed with ordinary water after each use,
or no letters will appear. A potion of poison may
be mistakenly identified as one other type (deter-
mined randomly). The chalice identifies three
potions per week at most.

of Irreversibility
**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 12,000
Prince of LANKHMAR®
This cup is owned by Purdue Darkwolf, but it will
never be used by him until well after the time he
gains immortality through lichdom. When this
transformation occurs, he will spend a great deal
of time studying his books and searching for
power and knowledge.

The chalice of irreversibility is merely an item
of revenge used by Purdue to get even with living
mortals for past crimes against him. He also uses
it under dire circumstances to rid himself of
opponents he feels are too powerful to destroy,
without risk of death to himself.

The chalice’s magic ts invoked only when fluid
is poured into it and drunk. When that occurs, the
character drinking from the chalice is frozen in
level. Never again can the person gain experience
points and levels, nor can skills and statistics be
improved. The person still continues to age nor-
mally.

Magical improvements on statistics do not
penetrate the shell of antimagic that the chalice
places around the character’s body.

The effects of the chalice of irreversibility are
permanent. If dispel magic or remove curse spells
are cast upon the infected character, they are inef-
fectual. The only way that the magical curse can
be dispelled is by use of a wish spell.

Planar Travel

**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 10,000
DUNGEON Magazine 25
This is a powerful magical item created by beings
from the Outer Planes to allow them easy access
to other planes. It belonged to Jaazzpaa for cen-
turies until he lost it while imprisoned in a stone
ring.

The chalice is a solid silver goblet about 9
inches high and 6 inches in diameter. Coiled
around the stem is a jewel-encrusted carving of a
snake. Five runes inscribed in gold are evenly
spaced around the chalice’s outer rim. These
runes are written in an ancient language known
only in the Outer Planes, though comprehend lan-
guages or legend lore spells can reveal their
meanings—the five planes to which travel is pos-
sible using the chalice are, the Prime Material
Plane, the Astral and Ethereal Planes, the Gray
Waste, and the Abyss.

To use the chalice, a being must touch his, her,
or its lips to the destination rune, then raise the
goblet in a drinking motion. Each of the five
planes has a separate command word, known only
to Jaazzpaa. If the correct command word is not
spoken after making the drinking motion, the
chalice does not function.

The chalice is worth 10,000 gp, although much
more could be obtained for it if any of the com-
mand words were discovered.

This golden chalice was enchanted in response to
the growing menace of the Horned Society. It
allows a lawful good fighter to temporarily
become a paladin of the same level for a single
quest, with all appropriate powers and abilities of
a paladin. The chalice can be activated only by a
lawful good priest who performs a ceremony that
includes special vows and the quest spell. The
fighter takes vows to the cause of lawful good,
then drinks holy water from the chalice. There-
after he or she can act as a paladin, with align-
ment changed to lawful good for the duration of
the assigned quest. Deviation from the vows may
cause the loss of some or all acquired powers, at
the discretion of the DM. The failure of the quest
causes the chalice to shatter.

liquid can be liquor or any other fluid substance
such as soup, water, wine, animal blood, mercury,
or maple syrup. The substance is any room tem-

magical creatures where two or more exist.

Chariot of Flames

[i nil

Chariot

A chariot is a light, fast open-backed vehicle. The
driver—and sometimes the passengers—must
stand. A chariot has two wheels and can be drawn
by a single draft animal or team of animals, (but
rarely more than four animals). War chariots can
be armored (including the wheels), and fitted
with sharp spikes or blades on the hubs to injure
or immobilize opponents.

Chariot of Flames
**XP Value:** 12,000 **GP Value:** 60,000
New Item

The chariot of flames (also known as the chariot
of fire or Sustarres chariot) is merely the priest’s
7th-level spell chariot of Sustarre fashioned into
a permanent magical device, often with addi-
tional powers. The first of these was enchanted by
followers of the hierophant druid Sustarre after
he departed Oerth to explore other planes. Addi-
tional examples were created in imitation of the
chariot of Sustarre spell as it spread to other
lands and worlds.

A chariot of flames at first appears to be an
unremarkable, two-wheeled chariot with a yoke
designed for two horses. When a command word
is spoken by a person who has mounted the char-
iot, the chariot bursts into flames, and two fiery
horses appear before it in harness. Thunder roars
and a thick cloud of smoke appears at the same
moment, causing all beings within 30 feet of the
chariot to be blinded and deafened for 1-2
rounds, except for those riding the chariot. The
chariot can make this transformation only once
per day, with the transformation lasting 12 hours
at most.

Beings other than the chariot’s driver and pas-
sengers who come within 5 feet of the chariot
suffer 2d4 points of damage per round; passen-
gers avoid damage if they were in the chariot
from the moment it burst into flames. Anyone
who leaves the chariot is unharmed, but if an
attempt is made to reenter it while it is aflame,
the mounting characters suffer the flames and are
burned. Those who find themselves in the char-
iot’s path may dodge to avoid burns by making
successful saves vs. petrification, with Dexterity
adjustments. Flammable material must save vs.
fire if the chariot touches it, or else it catches fire
and burns normally; live, green vegetation burns

only on a roll of 1.
970

Franklyn’s Incredible Chariot

The person speaking the command word
becomes the chariot’s driver, though no reins are
needed to guide it. The chariot obeys commands
to stop, walk, trot, canter, gallop, fly, turn left or
right, or go up or down in flight. It moves at 12
with horses walking, 24 trotting, 36 cantering,
and 48 flying or galloping. Movement rates have
no time limit, but ground rates are effective only
over normal roads or plains.Rough, rocky ground
of any kind reduces speed by
half and causes all passengers but the driver to
take 1 point of damage per round and make Dex-
terity checks every round, or else be thrown from

the chariot for 1d6 points of damage per 12 of |

movement (a thrown passenger would take 3d6
damage if the chariot was at MV 36).

The vehicle and steeds are AC 2 and each has
30 hp. The chariot and its horses cannot attack
others or defend themselves. Though immune to
all fire or heat attacks, magical or otherwise, the
chariot and horses can be struck by magical
weapons for full damage. A quart of water inflicts
1 point of damage, cold spells inflict 1 point per
die of damage, and complete immersion in water
or a dispel magic spell ruins the enchantment,
turning the chariot into a normal one. Physical
damage, such as that from weapons, is permanent
and cannot be fixed. The damage from water or
cold attacks, however, is removed each day at
dawn, leaving the chariot and horses again as
new. The effects of dispel magic last only 3-30
rounds. As the horses are fiery creatures from the
Elemental Plane of Fire, needing neither rest nor
nourishment.

Aside from the driver, up to seven other beings
of human size may ride in the chariot. Each
human-sized being may be replaced by four
beings of Tiny size or two beings of Small size;
four human-sized beings may be replaced by a
Large-sized being. Additionally, a human-sized
being may be replaced by up to 200 pounds of
nonliving cargo placed on the floor.

A power often added to this chafiot grants it
the equivalent of an airy water spell, allowing the
chariot to continue burning (and its passengers to
continue breathing) if immersed in water. This
also negates any damage to the chariot or horses
from contact with water. Another power allows
the chariot to lay down a column of opaque
smoke on command while traveling, equal to a
cylinder 10 feet in diameter, for up to 1 hour of
movement per day.

Although this appears to be an ordinary wooden

chair, when seated in the chariot, the user can see

seven gems inlaid in the right arm. These gems
are actually controls. The gems and their func-
tions are:

* Emerald: Chair glides forward at the pace of
a walking man.

¢ Ruby: Chair moves forward at the pace of a
running man.

* Diamond: Chair reverses direction, turning to
face the opposite way.

¢ Sapphire: Chair turns to the left.

¢ Topaz: Chair turns to the right.

* Peridot: Chair slows to next slower speed,
from running to walking, from walking to
stopped.

* Amethyst: Chair stops—instantly.

All movements are silent. The chair functions
best on level ground, slowing as a man on foot
would for rugged terrain and halting in areas
where a man could not walk. It will bear a burden
of up to 200 Ibs, in addition to the weight of one
human-sized passenger.

Hover
**XP Value:** 20,000 **GP Value:** 100,000
Kingdom of Nithia

Hover chariots are magical devices used strictly
by the military. It is rumored that the know]l-
edge to build these weapons was bestowed by
Rathanos himself on the weaponsmiths of the
Pharaoh Tur-Ah. Since then, the knowledge has
remained a royal secret, passed down through
the dynasties.

When at rest, the hover chariot is a metallic
cupola mounted atop an articulated metal frame.
When activated, the frame is covered by the fiery
manifestation of a beast. The flame beast moves
with the same speed and agility as its physical
counterpart. Attacks and defenses are also the
same. The difference is that the flaming manifes-
tation of a hover chariot is generally larger than
the actual animal it represents, and deals 6d6
flame damage, in addition to the claw or bite
damage of the animal. Hover chariots cannot be
activated without a control ring that is worn by
the chariot’s owner. The rings cannot be trans-
ferred to another person without the willing par-

ticipation of the previous owner.

Myl’s Mouse Chariot

For the most part, terrain is of no consideration
to the driver of a hover chariot. Exceptions
include dense forest (which makes traveling atop
a flaming beast impractical), and high cliffs
(those over 75 feet in height). Those hover chari-
ots designed as flying birds (hawks, eagles, ibis)
have a flight ceiling of 500 feet.

In terms of battle, a hover chariot has an effec-
tive Armor Class of -3. Missile weapons used
against the chariot must make saving throws vs.
fire or be burnt up, causing no damage.

Myl’s Mouse

Like the mouse cart, when Myl secures a mouse
in the harness, the cart expands to the size of a
normal cart that the mouse can pull at a move-
ment rate of 12, even with up to 250 pounds of
cargo. The mouse obeys the commands of the dri-
ver. Unlike other mouse carts, though, Myl can
attach multiple mice to the harness and pull 250
pounds per mouse (up to six mice) or he can
attach six mice and “race” the chariot at a rate of
21. The mice tire after one turn of continuous rac-
ing. A creature polymorphed into a mouse can
also activate the cart’s magic.

of Ra

**GP Value:** 200,000
Old Empires
There were originally three of these artifacts,
the chariots of the gods Ra, Horus, and Osiris,
in the days before the Orcgate Wars. Only one
is known to still exist. The chariot of Ra is the
oldest of the artifacts of great magic still in
active use in Mulhorand. Legend speaks of it
being constructed by a god named Ptah, who
has never been worshiped in the Realms, even
in the old days of Mulhorand.

The chariot of Ra is constructed from gold,
emblazoned with Ra’s solar disc against an
ankh. The chariot can move, without horses, at a
speed of up to 96; any who fight from it receive
a bonus of +4 to their Armor Class, and those
attacking them receive a -4 penalty to their
attack and damage rolls. Those who ride in the
chariot are 75% magic resistant. Anyone struck
by an attack from the chariot has to roll a suc-
cessful saving throw vs. spell or suffer blindness
for 2d4 turns. The chariot also grants a +4 bonus
to Morale to all friendly troops within a 200-

**XP Value:** 40,000

yard radius, and a 4 morale penalty to enemy
troops within that radius.

Red Chariot of Agni
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:**
Gods, Demigods, & Heroes
This chariot, whose wheels are made of the seven
winds, is pulled by two giant red horses. On the
ground it travels at a MV rate of 36, when in the
air it travels at 48. The vehicle casts heat in a 30-
foot area about itself for 25 points of damage.
The horses have 50 hit points and only respond to
telepathic direction.

 

Surya’s

This device is made of a piece of the sun pulled

rides it. The chariot travels with no limits placed
on speed. The horses are always noncorporeal,
never affected by magic, and take 25 hit points
apiece.

Underwater Chariot
**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 15,000
The Sea People

Underwater chariots are built using kelp fronds
and stems that have been lashed together. Unlike
normal chariots, they do not have wheels; rather,
they are smooth bottomed, much like a small
boat. They are pulled by a variety of large sea
creatures, including dolphins, sea horses, whales,
or manta rays. Underwater chariots are used for
transport both under and on the surface of the
sea. They come in a wide variety of sizes—the
smallest holds one person, and the largest is capa-
ble of carrying four people. They have a continu-
ous water breathing power that allows air
breathing creatures to safely take passage on
them as long as they are in contact with the char-
iot. The water breathing effect does not affect
water breathers.

Some underwater chariots are used as plat-
forms to carry and fire powerful harpoons. These
are used primarily by the triton forces of Under-
sea. Harpoons are also carried on the backs of
giant manta rays.

of Vix
**XP Value:** 12,000 **GP Value:** 60,000
The Milenian Scepter
Vix is the mortal daughter of the Immortal Zar-
gos (alias Nyx, see Wrath of the Immortals). She
is a powerful warrior and favored by Zargos, who
has indirectly given her several magical items,
including the chariot of Vix.

The origin of the chariot remains a mystery.
Some scholars believe it was created by Zargos
while he was still a mortal sorcerer many circles
(years) past. Others claim it was stolen from
Ixion, Immortal Patron of the Sun, and was once
pulled by his fiery steeds.

The chariot is constructed with a wooden
frame covered with bronze plates, which are in
turn overlaid with designs in silver and gold.
Wicked blades of blackest obsidian extend from
its hubs, sticking out perpendicularly from the
wheels, The chariot can carry two human-sized
passengers. While a beast is hitched to the char-
iot, the creature receives the benefit of a haste
spell, doubling its normal movement rate. How-
ever, the beast cannot make twice the normal
number of attacks; it can only move twice as fast.
If the beast has the ability to fly, it can still fly
while pulling the chariot. This is because the
chariot has the power to /evitate, making it virtu-
ally weightless.

Charm
Charms are small metallic or stone trinkets. Most
charms are shaped like animals, symbols, letters,
or the silhouettes of animals or people. Each trin-
ket has a small loop on the uppermost section that
allows the owner to place the trinket on an anklet,

Soe

bracelet, or necklace. Only two magical trinkets
can be placed on a chain and only five can be
worn by the same person at one time.

of Boot Restoration

This is a miniature brass boot. When rubbed
against a worn heel or sole of a shoe or boot, it

thickness (but without a “new” appearance).
Usable once per day.

of Distraction

**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 5,000
DRAGON Magazine 184
This minor magical item is usually shaped like a
pendant in the form of a neogi’s head looped
through a chain. The wearer of this magical item
gains several benefits. First, the charm acts as a
standard ring of protection +1, The charm also
bestows upon the wearer an additional +1 (fora
total of +2) on saves vs. enchantment/charm
spells. Lastly, the charm provides the function of
magically holding an opponent for one round.
This can be done once per day and is otherwise
similar to a wizard’s hold person spell, cast at the
8th level of ability. The neogi can attempt to hold
any single target he can physically see. The target
of the hold is entitled to a save vs. spell. If suc-
cessful, the target is unaffected. If the save fails,
the target is unable to take any actions until the
following round.

The neogi are very fond of this item; it often
buys them an extra moment to escape from the
clutches of an enemy or to distract a foe long
enough for the neogi’s umber hulks to rip them
apart.

of Favor
**XP Value:** 1,600 **GP Value:** 5,000
The Complete Fighter’s Handbook

When deities and other powerful beings are
pleased with the deeds of a mortal, they some-
times give him or her a charm of their favor. This
is a smal] object, sometimes a statuette, usually of
semiprecious material and 2 or 3 inches in size,
which represents the god or one an aspect of the
god.

The charm is rather like a limited wish. It rep-
resents a favor that the deity will perform for the

character at some time in the future. To use it, the
980

 

281

\
Hunting Charm

owner must throw the item on the ground so hard
that it breaks, and then call out the request.

The request must have something to do with
the attributes of the god, it’s no use asking the
goddess of love to dry up an oasis into a desert, or
to ask the god of earthquakes for a fog to hide the
adventurers.

The gods requested favors. And they, in the
guise of the DM, evaluate all requests. If the
favor is one that pertains to one of the god’s
attributes, and if the god does not think that the
character is making the request out of mere greed
or selfishness, and if the favor does not conflict
with any of the god’s other aims or desires, the
favor is usually granted.

So it would be appropriate to ask the god of
insects to send a cloud of bees to rout one’s ene-
mies, or to ask the goddess of love to cause
some NPC to fall in love with a PC, or to ask a
deity of the earth to cause fruit-trees to grow
and save the characters from death by thirst and
starvation.

Because the deity evaluates the character’s
request, the character cannot expect an outra-
geous favor to be granted. And most who would
steal a charm from a character cannot use it
successfully; one might take it, hurl it to the
ground and break it, adding a request, only to
discover the cranky god stomping on him and
freeing the faithful PC. (This, however, consti-
tutes using the favor.) But an NPC friend of the
charm’s owner might be able to get the item and
ask the god to help the charm’s true owner—
particularly if he or she is ill or kidnaped and
cannot act.

Any character of any class may receive such a
charm as a favor. But when they are found in trea-
sure, they are useless; they are not intended for
the character who finds them, after all. The
charm of favors does not radiate magic.

transmitted or contracted while within the build-
ing protected by the charm. Plague cannot touch
a protected building. The charm is effective so
long as it is hung in place. It is easily destroyed
by fire and other disasters.

of Protection from Fire
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 5,000
Oriental Adventures

This magical item, like other charms, is a long
strip of yellow or red paper. This charm is inked
with potent threats against the fire deities. Pasted
to the lintel of the door to a building, the charm
helps protect the building from fire. If thus pro-
tected, the building has only a 50% chance of
catching fire. Furthermore, if a fire should break
out, it burns slowly, causing half the normal
amount of damage. The charm does not lessen
the amount of damage characters might suffer
from a fire-based attack within the building, only
damage caused by the actual burning of the
building. The charm itself is immune to fire.

of Protection from Spirits
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 5,000
Oriental Adventures

This charm, on yellow or red paper, is inked with
powerful threats against spirits. Any spirit
attempting to enter the house must make a saving
throw vs. death magic to enter the building. If the
saving throw is successful, the spirit is unaffected
by the charm, If the saving throw fails, the spirit
cannot enter the building, although it can use
spells and missiles to attack those in the building.
The charm must be pasted to the lintel of the door
to be effective, however it cannot be touched by
any type of spirit creature.

of Protection from Theft
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 5,000
Oriental Adventures

This charm, on yellow or red paper, is written with
supplications to various deities to protect the
building from thievery. Any creature within the
building who attempts to move silently, hide in
shadows, or open locks has chances of success
reduced by 20%. To be effective, the charm must
be pasted to the lintel of the door clearly showing
to all that the house is protected. Any person, other
than the owner of the building, who attempts to
remove the charm, suffers 2d10 points of damage.

desert nights, while others increase sight and
hearing. Some examples of charms of resource
are provided below:

This item is actually two miniature metal black-
smiths’ anvils: one red, the other black. Each is
about I-inch square. If the black one is placed in
a fire, the red one will heat to the temperature

Cheese

Cheese is a form of preserved milk. Curdled milk
solids (the curds) are separated from the liquid
(the whey) and prepared in many different fash-

varied flavors, sharpness, colors, and textures.
The effect of a magical cheese is released either
by placing a piece in the mouth or by inhaling the
bouquet.

obvious to all within 120 feet, emerges. Other
creatures of the type named, if nearby, smell the
familiar odor and may be urprised to encounter
the user of the cheese of odors (-1 on surprise

POLYHEDRON Newszine 82

Several thousand years ago, the sorcerer Fextree
Belwikker fashioned a powerful set of chess
pieces from the teeth of a red dragon. Only seven
of the original sixteen pieces remain in exis-
tence—two pawns, a knight, a bishop, a queen, a
king, and a rook. Six of these seven figurines are
intricately carved representations of wizards in
assorted poses of varying majesty. The last piece,
the rook, is carved in the image of Fextree’s
tower. The pieces are each about 4 inches tall.
They are stored in a padded, rectangular case of
red cedar, and each piece is held in place by a
springy, metal clip. The latch and hinges of the
case are fashioned of bronze.

Pawns: The pawns are carved figures of

apprentice wizards in simple robes and sandals.
To invoke the power of a pawn, the possessor
needs only to utter the command word, “stale-
mate,” and 10 human-sized, mindless warriors
appear to battle the owner’s designated enemy.

The warriors battle until they are slain or until
10 rounds pass. They can be summoned once a
day.

Knight: This is a figure of a wizard in long
flowing robes and a tall pointed hat with a staff in
one hand and the reins of the stallion he is riding
in the other, By uttering the command word
“liege,” a human-sized knight, mounted ona
white, heavy war horse, appears to serve the
piece’s owner.

The knight can understand the owner, but can-
not speak. The knight and horse require no rest or
sustenance and heal at the rate of three hit points
a day. The knight and horse can be summoned
once a year, and faithfully serve the piece’s owner
for one month, unless slain earlier. They can be
dispelled by uttering the command: “Ye are
relieved from duty.”

Bishop: This is a figure of a stately wizard in
high-collared robes and a skullcap. The figure
holds a parchment as if reading it. When the com-
mand phrase, “] call upon the gods of magic to
deliver me a champion,” is spoken, a human-
sized wizard/priest is summoned.

Wizard/Priest (1): Int Exceptional; AL Neutral;
AC 2; MV 9; HD 10: hp 50; THACO 14; #AT 1;
Dmg 14 (staff); SD Immune to mind-affecting

The wizard/priest has the following spells in
memory—cure light wounds (x4), slow poison

(x4), cure disease (x3), cure serious wounds
(x3), cure critical wounds (X2), magic missile
(x4), glitterdust (x4), dispel magic (x3), rainbow
pattern (X2), and telekinesis (x2). The
wizard/priest remains with the piece’s owner for
up to three days, unless killed or dismissed ear-
lier, and cannot memorize spells during this time.
The wizard/priest does not require any rest or
sustenance. It can understand the piece’s owner,
but cannot speak other than to utter spells. The
wizard/priest can be summoned once every 10
days.

Rook: This piece is a model of a small, slim
tower with a pointed roof and thin, high windows.
Its powers can be invoked twice a month. Utter-
ing the command words “raise the keep,” instantly
produces a high stone building 80 feet square and
40 feet high. The keep has two floors, modest fur-
nishings, a well-stocked larder, and six mindless,
humanoid servants. The entrance is a stout, iron
bound oaken door that only opens for the bearer
of the piece. The keep comfortably houses 10
people for up to two weeks, after which, if the
bearer does not utter the command phrase again,
the building disappears. The keep can be dis-
pelled prior to this time by uttering the command
“rook surrenders.”

Queen: This carved figure depicts a shapely
sorceress clad in flowing robes with a circlet
around her head. Her arms are stretched upward
in front of her in a V-shaped casting stance. She
can be summoned once a month by uttering the
command word “majesty.” Unlike the other chess
pieces, the animated form of the queen remains
the size of the carved piece. The queen must be
carried or she reverts to her carved, inanimate
state.

Queen (1): Int Exceptional; AL Neutral; AC 8;
MV 12; HD NA; hp 30; THACO Nil; #AT Nil;
SD Immune to mind-affecting magic; MR 50%;

Once a,day, the animated queen can call forth a
globe of invulnerability to encase and move with
the individual holding her. The globe functions for
one hour per level of the holder of the queen. The
globe can be dispelled earlier at the holder’s desire.
In addition, the queen can cast hold portal, hold
person, hold undead, and hold monster once a day,
each cast at her owner’s level. The targeted crea-
tures are allowed saving throws vs. spell. The queen

remains animate for two days and can be sum-
mioned to serve her owner once a month,

King: This carved figure is a stately sorcerer in
a high-collared robe with an ornate crown on his
head and a gnarled staff in his hand. Speaking the
command words, “Beguile Ye,” calls upon the
figurine’s wizardly power. The king, which does
not animate, glows with a pale amber light and a
mass charm spell is released as if it were cast by a
\6th-level wizard. This power may be called upon
once a month. Speaking the command words
“make me a king” creates a town and surrounding
fields that cover 4 square miles and hold 500 vil-
lagers. The town has homes, shops, artisans,
craftsmen, peasants, a town watch, and all the
other trappings of a small, rural community. The
people behave normally and believe their forefa-
thers have dwelt here for centuries. They can
relate local lore that fits in with the geographical
area. They also know intuitively that the posses-
sor of this chess piece is their liege. The people
cannot leave their village; however, other crea-
tures and characters may enter and leave as they
desire. The village lasts for two months unless
dispelled earlier by the holder of the piece. This
power can be called upon once a year.

Khas is Krynn’s version of chess. It is played with
the same types and numbers of pieces as chess
(eight pawns, two rooks, two knights, two bish-
ops, and one king and queen on each side), but it
is played on a hexagonal field with each troop
starting in opposing corners of the board.

The Solamnic Knights believe that the game
reflects battles that are currently being fought
somewhere in the world. Indeed, legends tell that
great battles have been won or lost because of a
Khas game being played elsewhere.

Yarus’s board is 3 feet across, made of fine,
carved ivory, and inlaid with polished blue and
cream marble. The pieces themselves are intri-
cately crafted blue and cream granite.

POLYHEDRON Newszine 90
Marbol, a brilliant tactician, was once a war advi-
sor to King Azoun. However, he grew to hate
playing games with people’s lives and left the
king’s service to turn his hobby, chess, into a
Career.

Marbol learned the game as a child. Highly
intelligent and exceptionally well-educated, he
had a knack for predicting his opponent’s maneu-
vers, and he was known for winning in record
time.

Marbol traveled throughout the heart of the
Realms for several years, challenging players to
matches and winning games and prizes. He
became the undisputed champion, dominating
opponents of all ages and amassing a fortune.
However, the years caught up to Marbol, and,
with tired bones, he decided to settle down.

Ravens Bluff was his choice, as the inland sea
and the river traffic brought in new opponents
every day.

Marbol’s shop has a patio deck at the entrance,
where all of his games are played. There is also a
single room display area, a work room next to a
small kitchen, and lower-level living quarters.

He fashions all of the chess sets he has for
sale, carving them from various woods, sculpt-
ing them from clay, and chiseling them from
marble and other stone. The exquisite chess sets
are displayed on glass shelves throughout his
showroom. The chess pieces range in price from
1 gp to 100 gp each, and the boards from 10 gp
to 1,000 gp. The more expensive the set, the
more intricate the work. He even fashions sets
for nobility, often putting gems in the eyes of the
kings and queens.

The chess master maintains the shop without
the help of employees, amazing the patrons who
wonder where the old man gets so much energy
to keep the place clean and freshly painted. Mar-
bol’s secret is an enchanted marble chess set he
won four decades ago as the grand prize in a

Waterdeep meet.

Each piece can assume human form for up to
12 hours each day. The pieces are fanatically
loyal to Marbol and zealously protect him. Ifa
piece is defeated, it reverts to its marble form for
48 hours; the pieces cannot be permanently
killed.

Marbol considers the pieces close friends, and
after business hours they help him clean his shop,
polish the other chess sets, and play matches with
him. The knights (dressed in common clothes)
often hitch their steeds to Marbol’s wagon and
travel to nearby towns for wood, marble, and
other materials for chess sets. The knights take
turns animating so they can travel without stop-
ping. The old master has been known to hire
adventurers to bring back rare materials he wants
for special chess sets.

Chest

A chest is a box, usually a sturdy and durable
wooden construct with an attached lid, several
handles, and fitted with metallic bands to give it

enchantments that involve storing extra contents
or protecting the contents. Roll on the table below

This chest is of high quality and fine construc-
tion. Upon command, it summons 100 tiny,
spritelike creatures who arrive within it. They
vanish if the chest is opened and thus cannot be
seen except by clairvoyance or other magical
scrying. If a gem valued at 1,000 gp or more is
left in the chest along with a piece of parchment,
the tiny creatures draw a map. They bring their
own drawing tools, and, if left undisturbed for
one hour, they draw a map of the horizontal area
within 360 feet of the chest. The sprites then take
the gem, and depart. The chest can now be opened
and the map taken. The map is accurate and com-
plete, and includes secret, magical, and concealed
doors, pit traps, walls, and so forth. No creatures
or treasures are noted, and magical doors, walls,

- and hidden passages, are indicated by an “M.” If,

when they arrive, the creatures find no gem, they
curse the one who summoned them and immedi-
ately depart. The curse may be of any standard
type, but can only be removed by a caster of 15th
level or higher. The creatures may be summoned
once per day.

cushiony folds. Hidden between the folds is the

command word, sewn into the velvet itself. If

from one to five grains of sand are placed within
the folds inside the box and the command word is
spoken, the chest magically /ocks itself and does
not open again until the command word is
repeated. During the time that the chest is locked,
it begins to turn the grains of sand into perfectly
formed, nonmagical pearls. For each consecutive
day that the box is left undisturbed, each pearl
increases in value by about 3 gp. Thus, after a
week, each pearl would be worth 21 gp; after a
month, each would be worth 80-100 gp. If the
box is left unopened for longer than one year,
there is a 1% cumulative chance per day there-
after that the growing pearls become misshapen
and worthless.

Casting dispe/ magic on the chest does not
open it, but successfully casting a knock spell
against 14th-level magic does. However, the
pearls inside immediately disintegrare. If the
chest is ever broken, it loses all of its magical
properties forever.

made by the DM to see if any unsuspecting PCs
step on the snare,

Effects are as follows (roll 1d12: all spell

Some vendors in Waterdeep often sell merchants
antitheft snares good for only six, seven, or nine
uses. A typical sale price for short duration snares
is 50 gp.

Dispel magic will prevent a snare from fune-
tioning for one round per level of the caster. A
snare can be destroyed by dealing it 9 points or
more of edged weapon damage; it resists all
fiery or corrosive attacks, even if magical in
origin. Anyone wielding an edged weapon
against a snare receives cumulative damage
equal to a chill touch spell for each successtul
strike on the snare—the origin of the item’s
name. Each strike against the snare causes a

loss of one Strength point and |d4 points of

damage; the Strength loss is recovered at the
rate of one point per hour.

of the flail of the desert kings (see Flail Weapon),
but its enchantment is active only in the presence
of the flail. Its only function is to unlock the
flail’s power for its wielder.

The headpiece still carries the curse placed on
it thousands of years ago, a bane spell that con-
sumes the mind of any individual using the circlet
to unlock the flail’s powers. Using the circlet to
activate the flail curses the user with delusional
insanity. Anyone suffering from this affliction
believes himself to be a monarch or even a god.
Victims are instantly hostile to those who fail to
recognize their glory and are seized with a desire
to use the flail’s powers to punish unbelievers.
Pursuing greater power becomes the owner's sole
preoccupation.

The circlet can be removed from the head of
the wearer, breaking its hold on the victim,
though the wearer will never allow this. The only
way to break the curse is to destroy the circlet
utterly.

**GP Value:** 1,000
DUNGEON Magazine 13
This magical, ring-shaped head ornament gives
off dweomers of both alteration and enchant-
ment/charm. After it is placed on the head, the
user is immediately affected as if a feeblemind
spell had been cast (no saving throw), but this
condition lasts for only five rounds. Furthermore,
the circlet magically binds itself to the wearer’s
head. It remains attached for 10 rounds, during
that time it can only be removed by a wizard of at
least the 16th level or by a wish spell.

The wizard Dalvan Meir created this device in
order to insure his ability to enter a wearer’s mind
from his magic jar crystal. He also wanted to
allow himself an easy means of egress from his
desolate tomb, so he gave the circlet the addi-
tional power to force back iron barriers, granting
the wearer a +25% bonus on the bend bars/lift

Diadem of Disenchantment

The Endless Stair

This golden headband is adorned with a single
gem, worth 100 gp or more. If the gem is shat-
tered or removed, the diadem becomes nonmag-
ical, While worn, the diadem confers upon the
wearer immunity to charm, sleep, hold, and
confusion spells (as well as monster abilities
and magical item effects that cause these
effects). Each such defense of the wearer drains
the diadem of one charge (such diadems nor-
mally have 2d10 charges), and such items are
not rechargeable—when discharged, the gems
shatter and are ruined. A wearer of a diadem of
disenchantment gains two additional protec-
tions from the device that do not drain charges
(but are lost when the diadem’s charges are
drained)—a +1 bonus on saving throws vs.
paralysis (from any source), polymorph magic,
and ESP; and a +4 bonus on any saves vs. spell
when faced with feeblemindedness (thus the
wearer saves at par, not at -4).

(worse still, there are at least three of them in
existence, though there may be six). The diadem
is also known as the helm of horror and the
cadaver comb, Its normal form is that of a simple
coronet made of coral, with tiny carvings of sea
creatures on it.

The diadem’s first function is its ability to
shapechange into any sort of article meant to be
worn on the head. Its most popular forms, besides
the diadem shape, are those of a jeweled comb or
an elaborately designed, open face helmet. The
diadem can change shape seven times a day. The
fact that it comes in several different forms
makes it harder to identify by sight.

When the diadem is first worn, a user gets a
tingling sensation, as well as a feeling of happi-
ness that he or she has put on the diadem. A vic-
tim refuses to part with the object regardless of
friends’ pleas, offers of great wealth, or any other
incentives.

As time passes, a wearer’s actions and thoughts
become increasingly evil. On the middle night of
Nuitari’s next High Sanction, the wearer’s align-
ment changes to the evil version of the current
alignment (a lawful good character becomes law-
ful evil).

If the wearer ts already evil, there are no ill

Sanction. For the entire seven days. a wearer
takes every opportunity to commit senseless acts
of evil and succumbs to lyeanthropy (determine
the type of werebeast randomly).

The other powers of the diadem include a +3
bonus to saving throws and Armor Class and 15%
magic resistance. For spell purposes, the diadem
functions as a [6th-level caster. The diadem also
wives the wearer a $4 reaction bonus when deal-
ing with evil-aligned creatures and shuks.

When worn, the diadem enables the user to
cast the following spells, cach once per day — ani-
mate dead, hestow curse, dispel magic, fear,
flame strike, know alignment, meld into stone,
and speak with dead.

Obviously, no self respecting Dargonesti would
wear this diadem. Its purpose seems to be to cre-
ate evil Dargonesti. presumably to follow
Savarassi.

Destroying a diadem is not easy. Only striking
it with a holy weapon, having a dispel evil spell
cast upon it by a good priest of at least 20th level,
or surrendering it to nine dragon turtles on the
middle night of Nuttari’s Low Sanction can
destroy one of these accursed objects.

Golden
**XP Value:** 7,000 **GP Value:** 12,000
DRAGONLANCE Adventures

The golden circlety were created in [star toward
the end of the Age of Might. They were designed
to guide the people into aiding the church. Their
use, however, tended more toward slavery than
service. Even so, they could only be used by one
of good desires and so their abuse was somewhat
limited. Many of these survived the Cataclysm
though they are guarded most carefully.

This thin, gold band, when worn on the head of

a priest of good alignment, grants two magical
abilities. Once per turn, the wearer can command
up to § Hit Dice of creatures. Also once per turn,

as long as the user concentrates. one creature of

up to 4 Hit Dice can be controlled by the circlet’s
wearer. The creature is not charmed, however,
and cannot be forced to hurt itself.

luales of the Lance

Over the generations, the golden circlet (eircler of

pride) has brought about some of the great

hi ie

tragedies of Krynn. Some tales say it brought an
end to the proud kingdom of Ergoth. All tales
avree that it contributed to the kingpriest’s mad-
ness. Even so. the mind-warping and dominating
powers of the golden cirelet have shrouded its
history in malaise. Sadly. only those with the
malevolent power to use this item know its true
operations.

Worn upon the brow, the golden cire/et can
command up to 8-HD of creatures. once per turn.
Commands must be only one word, and spoken
aloud in a language the creature understands.
Each command lasts one round. Alternately, the
wearer once per turn may concentrate on one
creature of up to 4 HD who ts within 60 feet. This
focus allows the wearer to control the actions of
the creature as long as concentration is main-
tained. This is not a charm spell and the creature
will not intentionally harm itself. The evil god
Hiddukel takes the control of the mind one step
further. He uses the circlet to place a suggestion
in the mind of the wearer, offering a deal that is
hard to refuse. [f the person agrees, the circlet’s
full range of powers becomes available.

The cirelet can be used at will to heat or chill
metal and to cast a modified command spell that
can only use sentences of seven words or less. It
also adds a +2 bonus to the wearer’s Charisma,
and supplies a 2 penalty to Wisdom.

Each use of these dark powers permanently
drains one hit point from the wielder. The points
may be recovered by draining life energies from
another creature as if an undead creature. When
the wearer strikes with hands, tecth, ar feet, two
experience levels (like a spectre) may be drained
from the target and one hit point is gained per
level drained (up to his or her maximum). Each
time a level is drained in this manner, however,
the character must make a system shock roll or
permanently lose 1d3 points of Constitution. If
the character’s Constitution falls to zero, he or
she becomes a mindless spectre, abandoning the
circlet of pride to another.

This artifact ultimately corrupts a wiclder,
making the character conceited, arrogant, boast-
ful, and vain. Only monstrous mintons may then
be attracted and those who share his or her preju-
dices and hatreds.

The golden circlet belongs to the Triad of
Betrayal---the three artifacts created by Reorx
and the gods of magic and imbued with the
essence of Hiddukel. The cirelet’s true name is

Golden Circlet of Greyhawk
**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 30,000
GREYHAWK Adventures
This golden circlet was fashioned for use by the
Lord Mayor of Greyhawk, and is rumored to be
in his treasure vaults. When worn on the head, the
circlet allows a character to summon a band of
thieves in much the same way as a horn of Val-
halla summons fighters:
¢ User is 4th level or less: summons |[d4 4th-
level thieves
* User is 6th—&8th level: summons 1|d4 &th-level
thieves
* User is 9th-12th level: summons |d4 12th-
level thieves
* Useris [3th level or more: summons one
18th-level thief with maximum ability scores

The user can employ the circlet at less than its
full powers if desired. The summoned thieves are
friendly to the user, but refuse foolhardy tasks:
“Go fight that fiend” would get a good laugh out
of them. The thieves remain for eight hours or
until they are killed. The |2th-level and lesser
thieves all have average statistics, wear leather
armor, use short swords, and have normal thief
equipment. The | 8th-level thief has an armor
class of 2 (still wearing leather armor), uses a
short sword +3, and 1s 30% likely to steal the best
magical item he or she can use from any treasure
hoard found during his stay there; it vanishes
with the thief,

and if the optional power score rule is used, can

alter power check rolls up or down one point to
try to achieve the score (a 20 still fails). Finally,
once a day, the circlet lets the psionicist use one

at no initial cost (the maintenance cost must still
be paid, however). The science or devotion must
be one that the psionicist currently knows.

weapon, increased Hit Dice, increased combat
modifier, and decreased THACO. A dragon auto-
matically receives the innate, magical powers that
are normally gained by dragons only when they
reach the age category of wyrm. Finally, a dragon
can cast as many spells as a wyrm (it doesn’t
automatically learn any new spells, however, so
this might not be a significant benefit).

All ofthis assumes that the dragon isn’t already
a wyrm or great wyrm. Wyrms are unaffected by
the circlet, while great wyrms diminish in power
while wearing the cirelet.

The cirelet may be removed at any time, but
the mental shock causes the creature to be stunned
for 1d4+1 rounds. For each round that the dragon
engages In melee combat, there’s a 5% (noncu-
mulative) chance that the circlet falls off, stun-
ning the dragon, If the dragon grapples or ts
grappled by another dragon, the chance increases
to 10% per round (noncumulative) as long as the
dragons continue to grapple. There is also a one-
shot, 7% chance that the circlet falls off during a
wingover maneuver.

Dragons can wear the circlet only when they're
in their own form. Polymorph and shape change
spells cause the circlet to fall off, stunning the
dragon.

There are legends ofa similar circlet of the

Claw

Claws are long, sharp, and curved nails found on

the feet (or paws) of animals. Usually thought of

as a predator’s trait, many herbivores have claws
for defense or for digging and climbing. Magical
claws are usually attached to a handle or some
other device that allows a humanoid user to use
them as slashing weapons.

function.

The claw’s real purpose ts to steal spells from

save means that a randomly selected spell is
drained from the wizard’s memory and its energy
transferred to the claw’s owner. The owner of the
claw may then use the magical energy to “power”
a memorized spell, provided tt is of the same or
lower level. Such a spell may be cast without
being lost from the mind of the wizard possessing
the claw.

The claw of magic stealing does not store mag-
ical energy in any way: either the owner of the
claw uses the energy to “power” a spell on the
next round, or the energy dissipates and ts lost,

Long ago, a great rochike bird appeared to a wan-
dering priest. The bird said 1t was Immortal, and
had already seen three cycles of life on earth
each ending in destruction by water, ice. and fire.
It gave one of its smallest claws (a mere 2 feet
long) to the priest. Explaining its powers. the
Mighty Simurgh asked that it be used for the bet-
terment of mankind. The priest did what she
could, but lives no more, and the claw has appar-
ently fallen into the clutches of evil.

The claw is a curved talon 25 inches long,
made of an ivory-like substance.

The artifact is active when acquired. Once the
claw is claimed, full knowledge ts granted tele-
pathically during the user's first sleep.

Suggested Powers: (All abilities are cast at
20th level.) Cad others (range 10 feet; effects up
to 40 hd of levels). turn bonus (ld6+2 hd). pre-
dict weather (duration 12 hours; effects 40 square
miles), immunity fo poison (duration 18 turns:
affects self only).

Suggested Handicap: The handicap is acti-
vated when the first power ts used—the user
loathes violence, urges peace to all living things,
and refuses to attack anyone unless attacked. This
effect does not include undead.

Suggested Penalty: Simurgh may appear

nado, falling snow, or similar weather conditions
are present. The user imagines that the Simurgh
has demanded an interview. The user must gather

**XP Value:** 3.750 **GP Value:** 35,000
Old Empires
The great wizard Nezram made a number of
unique, magical items before he left the Realms
tor parts unknown, One of the most unusual is the
claw of Nezram. It is a replica of a humanoid
hand made of ivory, studded with rubies, with
sharp claws instead of fingers,

The claw has several functions. Its mundane
function causes it to scratch any part of the
wielder’s body on command, to relieve an itch. If
ordered into combat, the claw has two options—it
may slash at an opponent, causing |d6 points of
damage: if it inflicts maximum damage on any
attack, it grabs the target around the throat and
causes 2d10 points of damage per round until the
target is dead. Or, it may grab at a target’s weapon
hand, negating one attack each melee round (if a
victim has 3/2 attacks, the first round attack is
lost as well as one of the second round attacks),
The claw is AC 0. If 50 points of sharp-edged
damage are done to it, it stops attacking for 24
hours; 200 points of such damage completely
destroys it.

The claw is intelligent; any new master trying
to control it must battle against a neutral align-
ment, 12 Int, and 16 Ego (as an intelligent sword).
The hand glows red if rubies (other than the ones
embedded on the hand) are within 50 feet.

Nezram is known to have constructed at least
five claws, one of which is tn the possession of
Hodkamset, the most powerful wizard of the Cult
of Set.

appear to be eagle’s talons, plated in a dull sil-
ver that resembles pewter. When two of them
are thrown down, and the proper command
word is given, they immediately attack, caus-
ing 2d4 points of damage per round for one
turn before they become inactive for 24 hours.
They can be stopped with the proper command
word, or a successful dispel magic spell cast
against 12th-level magic (which also neutral-
izes them for 24 hours). No weapon can touch
them in combat and they appear to be inde-
structible.

There is enough venom for 1d10 doses in a single

The other use of the talon is contained in the
wide upper end of the claw. This contains a small
amount of powder. If cast into the eyes of a vic-
tim within 5 feet, that victim must save vs. spell

A claw can be thrown up to 40 feet at an
opponent with the thrower’s normal THACO,
and willed to activate if it hits. Another com-
mon method is to curl the claw around the end
or edge of a bludgeoning or slashing weapon,
perhaps even transfixing it on the point ofa
piercing weapon, and willing the item to take
effect if the weapon hits. A claw does not cause
damage, either by itself or in addition toa
weapon it rides. It causes any victim it strikes to
twist, writhe, and flail in pain the round after it
strikes, no applicable saving throw. This gives
the victim’s Armor Class a penalty of +2, pro-
hibits any spellcasting or other attacks, and
causes all held items to be dropped (2% chance
per level or Hit Die of the victim of retaining
hold on any item). The claw vanishes after one
use. A twisted claw cannot affect any undead
creature, though its magic is not wasted if used
against such beings.

A twisted claw can override a ring of free
action or similar magical protection; it was
specifically designed to override such things. It
can be rendered inoperative by an antimagic
shell, until removed from the shell’s area of
effect.

voluminous enough to allow the user to wear

Also known as a cloak of air pockets, this appears
to be an average cloak and hood. When worn out-
side any planetary atmosphere, the cloak magi-
cally doubles the size of a wearer’s air envelope,
which greatly increases a character’s survival
time away from a ship or planetoid. A human size

‘air envelope increases to hold enough fresh air

for 4d10 turns.

When the cloak is worn in the presence of
fouled or stale air, it generates fresh air around
its wearer three times daily. This envelope
exists only within the hood of the cloak, which
must be pulled around the wearer’s head to be
of use. This pocket of fresh air stays in effect
for 2d10 turns, after that there is a 1d4 hour
delay before it can generate another fresh air
pocket. Note that this does not confer immunity
to poisonous gases; the cloak simply adds fresh
air within the confines of the hood but does not
remove any poisons from the air. However, a
wearer does gain a +1 to saving throws vs. poi-
sonous gases and vapors either in wildspace or
within planetary atmospheres.

XP Value; 1,500 **GP Value:** 15,000

DUNGEON MASTER Guide
Fashioned of dark brown or black cloth, a cloak
of this type is not readily noticeable as unusual. It
radiates both enchantment and alteration in equal
proportions. The cloak bestows a 90% probability
of being invisible when the wearer is stationary
within a shadowy or dark place. The wearer is
also able to hang upside down from the ceiling
like a bat, and to maintain this—same chance of
invisibility.

By holding the edges of the garment, a wearer
is able to fly at a speed of 15 (Maneuverability
Class: B). If desired, a wearer can actually trans-
form into an ordinary bat—all possessions worn
or carried are part of the transformation—and fly
accordingly. Flying, either with the cloak or as an
ordinary bat, can be accomplished only in dark-
ness (either under the night sky or in a lightless or
near lightless environment underground). Either
of the flying powers is usable for up to one hour
at a time, but after a flight of any duration, the
cloak does not bestow any flying power for a like
period of time.

The cloak also provides a +2 bonus to Armor
Class. This benefit extends to the wearer even

when in bat form.

**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 12,000
DRAGON Magazine 112

The battle cloak entangles any weapon parried by
it (treat opponents’ unsuccessful attack rolls on
the cloak wearer or wielder as a parry). Magical
weapons must then make a saving throw of 20,
with a bonus equal to their magical bonuses;
those magical weapons without combat bonuses
save on a 20, and all artifacts save at +5 or at their
own bonus, whichever is greater. Failure to make
the save binds the weapon fast to the cloak for
1d3 rounds. This entanglement prevents further
attacks using that weapon, and a bend bars/lift
gates rol! is needed to pull the weapon free pre-
maturely. If an attacking creature leaves or moves
away to engage another opponent before the 1d3
rounds are up, it must part company with its
weapon, which remains in the possession of the
cloak-bearer.

The cloak has one other function—on the
speaking of a command word while the cloak is
held (but not worn), it transforms into a stout bar
or cudgel for 1d4+4 rounds. The cudgel is largely
composed of magical force, is not damaged by
normal usage (except for contact with magical
weapons or spells), counts as magical for attack
purposes, but has no bonuses; it does 1d6/1d3
points of damage, and cannot be used to entangle
other weapons as above. The cloak can be
destroyed by parrying (in the above manner)
eight blows from magical weapons while in this
form, It can be wielded by characters of any class
without proficiency penalties.

Bear Cloak of the Sulhaut Mountains
**XP Value:** 1,500 **GP Value:** 17,500
GREYHAWK Adventures
Many years ago, tribal shamans called upon their
gods to enchant the hide of a cave bear slain in com-
bat. The cloak became a powerful aid in their strug-
gle to survive against the hostile creatures and the
forces of nature that forever threaten their tribes.
The fur cloak included a bear’s head cap, pelt, and
claws. The cloak allowed a wearer to speak with ani-
mals twice per day and hold animal once per day. It
also increased a wearer's strength to 18/50 and gave
50% immunity to fear. Once a week, a wearer could
turn into a cave bear for 1d4+2 hours. The current

location of the cloak is unknown.

Cloak of Blackflame

of the Beguiler
**XP Value:** 3,000 **GP Value:** 17,500
FORGOTTEN REALMS MC Appendix

The cloak of the beguiler changes its hue and
the color of its wearer to match the coloration
of the surroundings—up to three times a day
for 1d4 turns each time. The wearer may
choose to remain absolutely motionless during
that time, hiding in shadows with 70% suc-
cess. Ethereal creatures close to the Prime
Material Plane may be observed and attacked
with ease. If the cloak gets wet, its properties
are nullified until it is completely dry. Each
time the cloak gets wet, there is a 10% chance
it mildews, causing the properties to vanish
forever. To fit an average human, 12 animal
pelts are required.

of Blackflame
**XP Value:** 20,000 **GP Value:** 100,000
The Five Shires

This magical cloak resembles a tangle of thick,
black cobwebs or black silk scraps when not
worn. When examined, it is seen as an intact, off-
the-shoulder half cloak. When donned, it fastens
by itself and alters to fit any wearer up to giant
size. Usable by beings of any race or class, it can
be freely removed and worn as long as desired.
Only one creature can wear and be protected by
such a cloak at a time.

A cloak of blackflame makes its wearer
immune to all energy level draining attacks,
whether they actually strike the garment or not.
The wearer is also rendered immune to all attacks
or effects that would ordinarily cause paralysis,
even in situations where no saving throw is usu-
ally allowed. Although such a cloak does not
make its wearer invisible, it does foil infravision
by shielding its wearer’s infrared aura.

Cold attacks do not affect a cloak of black-
flame, but all other sorts of attacks affect it nor-
mally. A damaged cloak confers full protection
until it disintegrates utterly into smoky wisps of
vapor. This occurs when a cloak suffers 14 points
of damage. Damaged cloaks can be repaired by a
keeper or other skilled hin using blackflame. A
day’s enchantment will restore 1d4+4 lost points
to a cloak.

Bolder’s Cloak of the Rogue
**XP Value:** 6,000 **GP Value:** 20,000
New Item

Centuries ago a brash young noble of Water-
deep, who needed to be furtive in order to go
adventuring, commissioned an unknown wizard
to create the cloak of the rogue. This young
man, whose name was Bolder, needed a magi-
cal item that would allow him to quietly slip
away from his father’s estate so he could spend
his evenings in the wilds of Waterdeep. Costing
him nearly all of his savings (a very consider-
able sum), Bolder commissioned the cloak from
a secretive wizard, and a month later was
rewarded with the item. However fate was not
kind to the brash young noble, for on the first
night he slipped past his father’s estate guards,
never to return. Although the fate of Bolder is
unknown, his cloak has appeared throughout
the Realms several times in the last century. A
cloak matching the description of the magical
garment was reported by Harpers engaging
agents of the Zhentarim near Amn a decade
ago. However the Zhentarim operative managed
to escape into the shadows of the night, taking
the cloak with him.

The cloak of the rogue confers and enhances
many of the skills of those who wear it, but only
if they are of the rogue class. Wearing the cloak
increases all thieving skills by 10%. It also adds
an additional multiplier to a rogue’s chance to
backstab an opponent, with a natural roll of 20
causing maximum damage to an unfortunate vic-
tim. The cloak functions as a cloak of protection
+J in all respects, and a wearer is allowed a sav-
ing throw vs. all detect magic and similar spells
(detect invisibility and the like).

Perhaps the most useful function of this cloak
is that the four pockets found in the inside lining
act as bags of holding, each holding up to 30
pounds. These pockets can only be seen by the
wearer; others cannot find them.

Bolder's cloak of the rogue conforms to the
shape of the wearer, from halfling to ogre, with a
full hood and hanging to the wearer’s knees. The
fabric of the cloak is unknown, but it has a silken
texture and a pattern of deep brown and black
swirls that are woven throughout the garment. The
cloak weighs one pound and can easily be rolled-up
and hidden in a pocket. It saves vs. destruction as
hard metal. If the cloak is stuffed into one of its
magical pockets, it is instantly destroyed.

The Complete Ranger’s Handbook

This lightweight, hooded cloak covers a wearer
from neck to foot, and may be worn comfortably
over studded leather or lighter armor. The color
of the cloak automatically changes to blend in
with the surrounding terrain. If a wearer enters a
jungle, the cloak becomes mottled with patches
of green and brown. If a wearer enters a plain of
snow, the cloak turns white. At night, the cloak
becomes black. The color changes are instanta-
neous.

A chameleon cloak allows a character to be

flage proficiency, in any terrain. The chameleon
cloak can conceal only one person at a time. The

IMAGINE Magazine 29

This gray cloak, wispy and tattered-looking,
allows its wearer to cast the following spells, once
per day, as though a 12th-level wizard—-feather
fall, gust of wind, fly, lightning, and control
weather, Any creature who touches a wearer of the
cloak of clouds must make a saving throw vs. death
magic or suffer 6d6 points of electrical damage.

of Comfort
**XP Value:** 1,500 **GP Value:** 7,500
DRAGON Magazine 112

This cloak imparts equable temperatures for
comfortable studying, physical activity, sleep,
and so on. It does this by alternatively exuding
heat or cold that it has magically absorbed,
including the heat of the sun, the chill of night
breezes, and extremes of temperature common to
deserts, glaciers, and other inhospitable regions.
The cloak’s outlines are always visible to crea-
tures having infravision. Notably, cold- and heat-
based magical attacks are absorbed by the cloak
harmlessly; the wearer is rendered immune to
cone of cold, heat metal, and similar spells.

Note that most fire-based spells and magic
like ice storm do damage for other reasons than
merely the temperature of their effects. A
wearer of a cloak of comfort suffers -2 hit
points per die of damage from ice storm and
fire-based magic of all sorts, although the cloak
itself is immune to the effects of flame and
freezing. Electrical and other energy attacks are
unaffected by such a cloak. The capacity for
absorption of such a cloak is not known—none
is known to have ever “overloaded” nor, when
destroyed, to have exploded or emitted any
bursts of heat or cold. A wearer of the cloak of
comfort never suffers the effects of exposure to
the wilderness, such as reduced Constitution,
Dexterity, though sunstroke (due to ultraviolet
radiation) and water damage to accouterments
are still possible. Hypothermia and the fatal
effects of frigid waters are not possible.

sight of a wearer of a cloak of delight, regardless
of any natural charisma, all who fail to save vs.
spell feel loyalty and love for the wearer, and tend
to carry out even the most bizarre commands
with enthusiasm and alacrity. All who wish to
attack the wearer of such a cloak must save vs.
spell at every attack or strike at -2 due to reluc-
tance and remorse. Once per day, the cloak
wearer may entrance creatures who fail to save
vs. spell by causing the cloak to display the ulti-
mate pleasure and goal of each (creatures of low
or animal intelligence save at -3, nonintelligent
creatures are unaffected). Entranced creatures
remain in a motionless trance for 1d8 rounds,
oblivious to their surroundings, but will attack
any creature or object obstructing their view of
the cloak in a demented rage. Use of darkness,
pyrotechnics, or similar obscuring spells ends the
trance. Entranced creatures cannot employ psion-
ics or cast spells.

A side effect of the cloak’s powers is that
everyone who views the garment will see it dif-
ferently, and give widely different descriptions of
it later.

Displacer
**XP Value:** 3,000 **GP Value:** 17,500
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Rules Cyclopedia

This item warps light rays; the wearer is actually
5 feet away from the perceived location. The
cloak gives a bonus of +2 to a wearer’s saving
throws vs. spell, wand/staff/rod, and turn to stone
attacks, Hand-to-hand attacks against the wearer
are penalized by -2 on attack rolls, and most mis-
sile fire automatically misses.

of Displacement
**XP Value:** 3,000 **GP Value:** 17,500
DUNGEON MASTER Guide
This item appears to be a normal cloak, but
when it is worn by a character its magical prop-
erties distort and warp light waves. This dis-
placement of light waves causes its wearer to
appear to be | to 2 feet from the actual posi-
tion. Any missile or melee attack aimed at a
wearer automatically misses the first time. This
can apply to first attacks from multiple oppo-
nents only if the second and successive attack-
ers were unable to observe the initial
displacement miss.
After the first attack, the cloak affords a +2 bonus

This cursed item is identical to a cloak of

elvenkind, and functions properly as such an item
at all times. When a wearer is attempting to be
silent and stealthy (and only at such times) all
noises made by the wearer are greatly magnified,
and loudly echoed. Thus, the sound of a footfall
or that of a weapon being drawn would alert other
beings to the presence, if not the precise location,
of the wearer. Whenever such an echo-activated
cloak is taken off, it emits a weird, echoing
falling cry as it ts parted from the being who has

dark brown, forest green, and even flat black.

The cloaks have four interior pouches, two on
the wearer’s left, and two on the right. The
pouches are easily sealed, and waterproof.

Creating a firebane cloak is a difficult, 60-day
process. For this reason, they are not given to just
any scout who happens to want one. Only kirath
who have shown that they can function as scouts
without benefit of marvelous concealment cloth-
ing are eligible to receive a cloak.

In game terms, earning a cloak occurs when the
PC survives the first level of experience, and has
gone on at least four scouting missions without
causing a mishap. Note that fulfilling the above
conditions does not automatically bestow a cloak
upon a supplicant. The DM must judge if the PC
has followed his or her alignment and the ways of
the Silvanesti with a bare minimum of deviation.

Since a firebane cloak s primary function is
concealment, decorations such as personal coats
of arms, jeweled broaches, or symbols of rank,
are not applied. The cloaks themselves are badges
of rank and a sign of competence.

Normally, the cloaks are held in place by means
of a simple leather thong sewn in the lining around
the throat. The knot used to secure the cloak is
configured so that tugging the drawstring in a cer-
tain manner causes the cloak to fall off in seconds,
if there is an urgent need to remove it quickly.

Firebane cloaks save as cloth, though they gain
a +3 bonus against all fire-based attacks. The
cloak weighs an average of two pounds, An elf
purchasing a firebane cloak pays 1,000 gold
pieces. A non-elf desiring to purchase a firebane
cloak must first of all convince the seller to part
with it. Once this is done, the buyer pays at least
2,000 steel pieces.

of Flame
**XP Value:** 300 **GP Value:** 1,500
POLYHEDRON Newszine 19
This cloak is either red or orange. It functions as
a cloak +/ for any wearer. When worn by a wiz-
ard, it conveys a sense of warmth, and functions
as a ring of warmth, Upon command, the cloak
can create a fire shield spell effect with hot
flames (to grant protection from cold only), but
this cancels the warmth. The duration of the fire
shicld is 1d4 turns. If the wearer casts any fire-
based spell (fireball, wall of fire, and so on), the
cloak may be used to add one point per die of
damage done. However, this causes the cloak to

sar cient”

become nonmagical for ]-4 turns after that.

This item inflicts 1d4 points of heat damage to
any cold-based creature striking the wearer (such
as an ice paraelemental). Unfortunately, it also
gives a +2 bonus to the attack rolls of fire-based
creatures (such as salamanders) attacking the
wearer. The cloak of flame radiates magical heat
at all times. This powerful cffect cannot be
negated or modified, and can always be seen with
infravision, even if the cloak and its wearer are
invisible. Its heat interferes with infravision used
nearby; creatures within 15 feet must use normal
or magical vision, since infravision can reveal
only a reddish cloud of heat.

Gargoyle
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 6,000
The Temple of Elemental Evil

When donned, this garment polymorphs the user
into a gargoyle, with the effects of the polymorph
self spell. No command word ts used. Items car-
ried are absorbed within the gargoyle form, unus-
able. Immunities, flying ability, and all other
gargoyle characteristics are bestowed. Armor
Class is likewise altered, but is modified by the
user’s true Dexterity, magical effects, and protec-
tive devices worn or carried (but excluding modi-
fications from armor and shield).

The cloak’s effects may be produced up toa
maximum Of three times per day. The po/ymorph
occurs immediately after the cloak is donned,
without the sparkling lights usually accompany-
ing a polymorph. After the first full turn of use,
there is a 10% chance per turn (cumulative) of the
wearer being mentally changed into a gargoyle as
well. {f this occurs, the user either attacks or flies
off (just as a real gargoyle). Only a wish or death
can then return the victim to normal form.

The cloak is easily damaged by any edged
weapon, fire, and other hazards. If the wearer
takes 20 or more points of damage from such
attacks, consider the cloak destroyed. The
cloak may be repaired magically (via limited
wish or a similar enchantment) but not by nor-
mal means.

As a final note, other cloaks of polymorphing
may be found. Each is designed to change the
user Into one specific creature. Each confers ben-
efits and hazards in the manner given above—a
full polymorph self (lacking only the spell’s cura-
tive effects), with the given chance of permanent

mental change as well.

The Assassin's Knot
This apparently ordinary cloak allows the user to
fade briefly into the Ethereal Plane up to three
times a week. It is activated by one segment of
concentration. No verbal command ts neces-
sary-—the character just begins to fade. The
process requires an Initiative modifier of five.
during which time the user cannot move, but may
defend against attacks. While fading into the
ether the character can be struck by any weapon
or spell.

At the end of the five segments the character 1s
wholly in the ether and thus invisible on the
Prime Material Plane and immune to most
attacks. While ethereal, the user can move at the
rate of 15 feet per initiative segment in any direc-
tion, even up or down, and can bypass walls, ceil-
ings, magical traps, and doors. At the end of three
initiative segments, the user will fade back into
the Prime Material Plane. The cloak cannot be
activated again for one full turn, and may be acti-
vated only three times in any one week. While in
the ether there is a 1% chance of an ethereal
encounter that may follow the user at the DM’s
discretion. A user who would rematerialize inside
a material object is trapped on the Ethereal Plane!
The cloak can be used but 12 times, after which
the item becomes nonmagical.

DRAGON Magazine 112
This cloak can be worn as a normal, heavy-duty,
all-weather cloak for an unlimited time, but when
magically activated, it serves only once. The word
of activation for all such cloaks is “Feerond,” the
name of their maker. When spoken, the cloak
becomes dangerous to a wearer's friends and foes
alike; it fires darts of pure force up to 30 feet dis-
tant in all directions. This spray of invisible mis-
siles lasts for seven rounds regardless of the cloak
wearer's intentions. No wearer can ever be struck
by any of these missiles, nor do such missiles ric-
ochet, but all creatures within 30 feet of a cloak
wearer (who may, of course, move and fight nor-
mally) suffer 6d4 points of damage per round; a
save vs, spell indicates half damage, and spells
such as shield, wall of force, antimagic shell, and
the like offer complete protection against the mis-
siles. The missiles also cannot penetrate other

planes or extra-dimensional spaces (for example,
those created by portable hole or rope trick
spells), although if a cloak wearer enters such a
space or plane by some means, the flurry of mis-
siles accompanies him or her. The missiles do not
hamper the movement rates of affected creatures,
but do prevent spellcasting that involves somatic
and material components. At the end of the
seven-round flurry of missiles, the cloak vanishes
forever.

This garment is a normal cloak of elvenkind with
several significant differences. The cloak confers
the invisibility benefits of a regular elven cloak as
follows:

Outdoors, natural surroundings

Heavy growth 100%
Light growth 99%
Open fields 95%
Rocky terrain 98%
Other Terrain
Outdoors, other buildings 90%
Brightly lit room 50%
Underground torch/lantern light 95%
Infravision special
Light/continual light 50%

Besides gaining the benefits derived from the
cloak’s chameleon powers, a scout ts also pro-
tected from infravision, since the material is satu-
rated with heatbane.

The cloak has a hood, which must be drawn up
around the head in order to take full advantage of
its invisibility and injravision protections. The
cloak 1s voluminous enough for the wearer to
wrap up in it, exposing nothing but shins and
feet.

The saturation of the firebane cloak in heat-
bane is so great that, if drawn fully around the
wearer, it grants a +3 bonus to saving throws
against all forms of fire, both magical and mun-
dane, and reduces each die of fire damage by —].
The cloak’s saturation in heatbane also acts as
insulation, keeping the kirath warm without
bulky furs. Additionally, the cloak 1s water-
proofed against the elements.

Unlike cloaks of elvenkind, firebane cloaks
come not only in neutral gray, but also light tan,

Guarding
**XP Value:** 1,500 **GP Value:** 10,000
DRAGON Magazine 91

This garment is identical in weight, texture, and
appearance to a normal woolen cloak, and is typi-
cally gray in color. When it is worn and the user is
struck by a physical blow, the cloak instantly
becomes rigid at the point of impact, deflecting all
nonmagical missiles and absorbing some of the
force from any other physical attack (-2 to damage,
down to a minimum of one point of damage per
die), After the attack has landed and withdrawn, the
cloak instantly becomes flexible again.

If a cloak of guarding is subjected to constric-
tion or sustained pressure (as in a deadfall trap, or
when caught between two walls that are closing
together), the garment protects a wearer in the
manner of a rigid suit of armor until it has suf-
fered 25 points of damage, whereupon it disinte-
grates. A cloak of guarding that is damaged in
this fashion cannot bestow its powers of protec-
tion upon a wearer again until it has rested for a
number of rounds equal to the number of points
of damage it has absorbed, or until it is taken off
and not worn for at least one round. The construc-
tion of a cloak of guarding (which involves metal
spun into fine threads) is such that the wearer will
take maximum damage, no saving throw permit-
ted, from heat, cold, or electrical attacks of all
sorts. The cloak itself cannot burn.

This magical item can appear as virtually any

healing on any living mammal causes the cloak
to pulse with a bright rosy light. When the light
fades, one round later, the being who donned tt
is instantly cured of all diseases, poisonings,
lycanthropy, or curses (not including geas or
quest spell effects), and all current damage.
Such cloaks function 2d4+1 times: the last time
they function, they fade into nothingness. They
work only on nonmagical mammals (of any
sort, including humans, demihumans, and
humanoids of up to ogre size, and even includ-
ing Pleistocene mammals such as mastodons,
but excluding such magical beasts as unicorns,
pegasi, and griffons). The cloak does not work
on the dead, nor on undead, and it cannot regen-
erate lost limbs or organs.

half damage from natural heat sources. The cloak
also protects the wearer from sparks and hot ash
ejected during a volcanic eruption, but not
chunks of rock (called “bombs” or “blocks”), The
cloak’s hood has a strip of cloth that can be
wrapped around a character’s mouth and nose to
keep dust and ash from entering the lungs; it also
provides a +3 saving throw bonus against inhaled
poison.

The cloak provides a +2 bonus to all saving
throws against magical fire or fiery dragon
breath, and reduces damage by one point per die
(each die inflicts a minimum of one point of dam-
age).

KalnaKaa found this cloak during his explo-
rations of his ancestors’ chambers. Any person
wearing the cloak can open any magical portal
from either side simply by touching the part of
the wall where the portal appears.

of Lathandar
**XP Value:** 3,500 **GP Value:** 17,500
_New Item

Found only on the world of Toril, the cloak of Lath-
andar was fashioned by priests of that god to pro-
vide power to their itinerant pests and wandering
champions. The cloak is made of black velvet on
the outside, but is lined on the inside with a rose-
colored pink silk. When it is opened wide, it
resembles nothing so much as the sun rising on the
eastern horizon, and it provides light for its wearer
as a continual light spell when held this way.

Another power of the cloak is to repel the
undead as a 7th-level priest. To employ this power
of the cloak, the wearer must simply call upon the
power of Lathandar, open the cloak to its fullest
span, and will the light of the god to come forth.
A coruscating ball of energy surrounds the cloak,
and then streams forth to engulf the undead
nearby. This turning is in addition to any a char-
acter might already have attempted, thus making
the cloak of Lathandar a potent weapon for those
who seek out the undead.

Lordliness

**GP Value:** 22,000
IMAGINE Magazine 12
The cloak is a companion to the crown of the
imperium. It should be constructed from furs or
skins appropriate to the ruler’s culture and worth
at least 6,000 gp, sewn together with platinum
thread worth 250 gp. A cloak of lordliness for a
human prince or princess would be made of the
finest ermine, while one for a hobgoblin chieftain
would be made from the frayed skins of a dwarf
or elf.

The wizard takes the cloak and casts enchant
an item and ventriloguism on it before an illu-
sionist casts audible glamer and deafness. The
wizard then casts a permanency upon the cloak.

The cloak has the effect of making any oratory
of a wearer so inspiring as to cause all within 60
feet to stop whatever they are doing to listen to the

speech, unless they make a saving throw vs. spell
at -4. This power can be used three times per day.

of the Manta Ray
**XP Value:** 1,800 **GP Value:** 9,000
Blackmoor
While underwater, this cloak’s wearer can breathe
freely and move as fast as a manta ray. The cloak
will fight as a manta ray when released to do so—
unfortunately, the wearer loses the ability to breathe
underwater while the cloak is not being worn.

of the Manta Ray II
**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 12,500
DUNGEON MASTER Guide
This cloak appears to be made of leather, until the
wearer enters salt water. At that time, the cloak of
the manta ray adheres to the individual, and he or
she appears nearly identical to a manta ray—there
is only a 10% chance that someone seeing the
wearer will know he or she isn’t a manta ray.

A wearer can breathe underwater and has a
movement rate of 18, like a manta ray (see the
MONSTROUS MANUAL accessory). The wearer also
has an Armor Class of at least 6, that of a manta
ray, but other magical protections or magical
armor can improve the AC.

Although the cloak does not enable a wearer to
bite opponents as a manta ray does, the garment
has a tail spine that can be used to strike at oppo-
nents behind. The spine inflicts 1d6 points of
damage, and there is no chance of stunning. This
attack can be used in addition to other sorts, for
the wearer can release his or her arms from the
cloak without sacrificing underwater movement
if so desired,

Mantle of Celestian
**XP Value:** 1,500 **GP Value:** 15,000
Unearthed Arcana

This garment is of black cloth—the color of the
7th Order of Priests of Celestian. It is otherwise
unremarkable. If the item is checked for magic,
the mantle radiates an aura of alteration. The
principal power of this wrap is to enable a wearer
to exist in the cold void of outer space. Its wearer
can breathe and feel as if he or she were in a cool,
well-ventilated place where any oxygen-breath-
ing creature could exist. It also protects against
poison gases of all sorts. The mantle also pro-
vides +1 on all saving throws vs. electricity, fire,
and noise (including drums of deafening or panic,

roaring, or thunder). The mantle is well suited for

travel, having the following qualities:

* Food: A wearer may simply reach inside one
of its many pockets and find sufficient rations
for one person for one day; this nourishment is
available once per day.

¢ Drink: In another pocket there is a small ewer
that provides up to seven gallons of water,
pouring cold or warm as the user commands.
Such a draught is obtainable once per day.

¢ Shelter: A wearer does not grow cold or hot
or become wet or damp while wearing the
mantle.

¢ Storage: The mantle has seven large and
seven small pockets, and only one of each is
needed for food and water, so the remaining
12 can be used to store whatever is desired (up
to seven pounds in the small pockets or four-
teen pounds in the large) with no bulk, bulge,
or added weight.

The mantle also has a special power that is
conveyed to the wearer only if he or she is a priest
of Celestian, whether druidic or not. This
dweomer enables a wearer to see the aura of any
stranger met along the way, so as to give warning
of evil, neutral, or good intent. The power is not
automatically bestowed, however, for a wearer
must concentrate to sense the aura.

Many Colors Cloak

——_ t= SS ee

Mantle of Mist

**XP Value:** 800 **GP Value:** 5,000
POLYHEDRON Newszine 47
This is a voluminous cloak made of valuable
white fur; it radiates an aura of alteration. Three
times per day the mantle can transform itself into
a dense fog cloud with dimensions of 20 by 20 by
10 feet. The fog lasts for one turn, or until the
wearer chooses to terminate it, whichever comes
first. It is useful in making a quick escape or
diversion.

Mantle of the Mundane
**XP Value:** 1,500 _ **GP Value:** 15,000

The Complete Thief’s Handbook
This very ordinary, even shabby, brown or gray
cloak makes its wearer appear utterly unmemo-
rable. It gives a 5% bonus to hide in shadows in
all circumstances and makes the wearer 80%
undetectable if in a crowd (detection resistance
also applies). It also makes a wearer almost
impossible to recognize after having been seen—
very useful in avoiding identification after a
crime. Unless a witness (and it must be an eye-
witness) makes a check against 4 of his or her
Intelligence, a wearer of the mantle appears so
mundane and boring in appearance that the wit-
ness is unable to recognize a user as the thief,
regardless of whether or not the thief is wearing
the mantle.

Many Colors
**XP Value:** 1,200 **GP Value:** 8,000
DRAGON Magazine 112

This rare garment can so shift its pigmentation
that its wearer is immune to the effects of color
spray, prismatic spray, and the like, and can
pass through a prismatic sphere or wall
(together with all items carried or worn within
the cloak) as though the barrier did not exist.
Only a wearer (not companions) is so protected,
and he or she is likewise solely protected from
blindness due to blur, pyrotechnics, hypnotic
pattern, darkness, blinding light of all sorts,
and magical effects.

The cloak itself does not seem to an observer
to alter its own colors, but always appears to have
a swirling and indistinct surface (aiding the suc-
cess of a wearer hiding in shadows by +10%;
25% when it is acting to shield its wearer’s gaze
from color effects cast at the wearer). The cloak

cannot, however, deliberately be used to camou-

flage the wearer by blending in with surround-
ings, nor does it have any power to affect crea-
tures other than a wearer, either by attack or by
conferring protection.

Once every 12 turns, a wearer, by effort of will,
can cause the cloak to glow white (equivalent to a
light spell, but not blinding). The glow lasts for
nine rounds, without any concentration required,
and ceases sooner if the wearer wills. Obviously,
a wearer cannot hide in shadows while the cloak
is being used in this manner.

Midnight Slasher’s
**XP Value:** 3,000 **GP Value:** 30,000
Children of the Night

The Midnight Slasher is not a man who likes to
stand for a fair fight. However, when he is able to
strike with surprise, he is a deadly assassin. The
black cloak that he wears was crafted by the drow
of Arak and is said to have been fashioned from
darkness itself. When the Slasher wears this
cloak, he is able to hide in shadows with 90%
effectiveness. His boots, along with his cloak,
work only in darkness; together, they give the
Slasher triple the normal chance for surprise.

Mummy’s
**XP Value:** 3,000 **GP Value:** 12,000
POLYHEDRON Newszine 47

Only a beggar would be seen in this once white,
now tattered, rotting cloak. When worn by a law-
ful evil character, it enfolds the wearer, making
him or her appear as a mummy with a 10% chance
to detect the deception. Additionally, the cloak
confers the power to cause disease three times
per day by touch, and makes a wearer immune to
the attacks of mummies. All good creatures
touching the cloak must save vs. death magic at
-1 (paladins save at -2) or lose 3,000 experience
points. A good creature who destroys the cloak
immediately gains 3,000 experience points. The
cloak can be used by characters of any class.

of the One Plume
**XP Value:** 4,200 **GP Value:** 21,000
Fires of Zatal

This cloak is a majestic item of pluma magic,
apparently crafted of a single, vast, multicolored
feather. Worn as a cape, it gives its user a number
of unique abilities.

The chief ability of the cloak is to enhance
one’s Charisma and leadership. It raises a user’s

ssf

Charisma to 18, and allows the individual to
function as if using the 2nd-level priest spell
enthrall. For BATTLESYSTEM rules, the command
radius of a cloak user is doubled. This ability only
functions for natives of Maztica, those born in the
True World.

The cloak can also function as a fly spell, but
only with a movement of 3 and MC of A, once per
day. The cloak also provides fire resistance like the
ring of the same name. This protection can extend
not only to a wearer, but to one other covered by
the cloak. These abilities may be used by anyone
wearing the cloak, regardless of birthplace.

Following the destruction of Nexal and yet
another eruption of Mount Zatal, the cloak was
believed destroyed. However, it was saved from
destruction by certain priests of Azul, who hid it
in a cave on the side of the volcano. They asked
their god for a guardian, and a young rain dragon
was sent to be that guardian. The priests who hid
the garment died soon afterwards, but other
priests of Azul maintain regular tribute to the rain
dragon, unaware of what he guards.

of Passage
**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 10,000

Dragon Dawn
The cloak of passage appears to be an ordinary
garment of gray-green cloth, but woven with
spider silk for a light, billowy weave. In fact,
the cloak holds unusual enchantments. Its
wearer can walk at will across the boundary of
the Ethereal and Prime Material Planes, taking
along anything he or she touches, as well as
other living beings, if they are in physical con-
tact with the wearer. Short of hulderfolk magic
opening the gateway to Summerhome, only
someone wearing this cloak can leave the Ban-
quet Glade and enter Taladas.

The cloak’s command word is embroidered in
ancient Elf on the inside collar of the garment.
When that word is spoken, the cloak’s wearer gains
the ability to walk into one plant and out of
another, like the priestly spell pass plant. When the
word is spoken in reverse, the cloak permits the
wearer to dimension door, as the spell. The cloak
bestows no special protections on its wearer, and
every time one of its properties is used, it ages the
wearer by one year. If the wearer removes the
cloak while on the Ethereal Plane or within a plant,
he or she is trapped there until some other means

of escape from that space can be found.

POLYHEDRON Newszine 65
This cloak of black wool, lined with deep purple
satin, radiates an aura of alteration magic. It
keeps its wearer warm and dry in any climate or
weather. It gives a wearer a saving throw bonus of
+4 against all forms of elemental attacks. The
cloak is so comfortable as to permit the recovery
of hit points while a wearer sleeps, as if he or she
were resting in a comfortable bed. The cloak has
other properties. It grants infravision to its
wearer. There are 12 hidden pockets inside that
open to an extradimensional space. They contain
the following items, which the cloak refills
daily—one-half pound of cheese, one-half pound
of fresh cinnamon raisin bread (warm), one
pound of spare ribs, four ears of steamed and but-
tered sweet corn, one apple, one orange, one pear,
one-half pint honey, one-half pound cracked wal-
nuts, one quart strawberries, one quart cold apple
cider, one quart cool water, and one hunting
knife.

of Poisonousness

**GP Value:** 2,500
DUNGEON MASTER Guide
This particular cloak is usually made of a woolly
material, although it can be made of leather, It
radiates magic. The cloak can be handled without
harm, but as soon as it is actually donned, the
wearer is stricken stone dead.

A cloak of poisonousness can be removed only
with a remove curse spell—this destroys the mag-
ical properties of the cloak. If a neutralize poison
spell is then used, it may be possible to revive the
victim with a raise dead or resurrection spell, but
there is a-10% chance of success because of the
poison.

in conjunction with any sort of magical armor,
normal, nonleather armor, or with any sort of

shield.

of Reflection
**XP Value:** 1,500 **GP Value:** 10,000
The Magister

These cloaks were made to protect rangers and
other traveling messengers in the service of the
High Lady of Silverymoon. The precise magical
defenses against each spell have been lost; the
knowledge died with the maker of the cloaks, the
wizard Irentalar. An attacking caster or wielder
can escape the cloak’s reflective effects only by
escaping into another plane (or extradimensional
space). Momentary dislocations such as blink,
dimension door, and teleport are not sufficient to
escape, and distance is not a factor. Elminster
does not know of any instance in which a wearer
of such a cloak faced a creature having natural,
magical powers akin to the spells reflected by the
cloak, but he believes that such magical powers
would be reflected as are spells and magical item
functions.

This cloak (many have been made) confers a
limited spell immunity upon any one living crea-
ture wearing or covered by it. The following
spells and magical item functions are directed
back at a caster/wielder as follows:

* Magic missile: reflected back at caster with
full effect (no saving throw).

* Shocking grasp: discharge directed back
instantly into caster and nullified; caster takes
no damage, but spell is lost.

* Forget: Spell distorted and thrown back at
caster, who is confused as the 4th-level wizard

spell confusion for the following round (no

saving throw); the forget spell is lost, and nei-
ther caster nor cloak wearer forgets anything.

* Irritation: Reflected back at caster, who is
affected unless save is made (negates effect).

* Ray of enfeeblement: Reflected back at caster,
who is affected normally unless a saving
throw is successful (negates effect).

¢ Hold person/animal/monster (if cast at cloak
wearer): Distorted by the cloak and reflected
back at caster, who must save vs. spell (at par)
or be slowed for two rounds.

* Tasha’s uncontrollable hideous laughter:
Reflected back at caster, who is affected nor-
mally unless save is made (but the caster’s
saving throw is always at par, never at a minus
due to Intelligence).

¢ Polymorph other: Reflected back at caster,
who must save at +2 or be affected normally
(system shock roll must be made, form
received is as caster intended).

* Feeblemind: Reflected back at caster, who
must save vs. spell at +2 or be affected nor-
mally.

* Color spray: Reflected back at caster, who
must save vs. spell or be struck unconscious
for 1d2 rounds,

* Entangle: Cloak wearer is unaffected by
entangle, but the spell has normal effect on
other creatures within area of effect; magic is
not reflected back on the caster.

The Magister

This dark brown or russet-colored garment acts
as a cloak of protection +2. A wearer of this
horned cloak is able to pass without trace at will.

The cloak is hooded, and on the hood are
mounted two long horns resembling those of a
bull. The cloak allows a wearer to take the form
of a bull (shape change) up to 6 times a day (24-
hour period) and change back again at will. But,
for every round spent in bull form, there is a
10% (not cumulative) chance that the cloak
vanishes forever, trapping a wearer in bull form.
This condition may be healed by dispel magic,
shape change (which leaves a cloak wearer in
original form when it expires), or wish-related
spells.

Only M-sized creatures may wear these cloaks
and employ their powers. Some cloaks have a
visored face mask that allows the wearer infravi-
sion (corresponding to his or her normal range of
sight), and 20% of the cloaks have a prehensile
tail mounted on the back, between the wearer’s
shoulders.

This tail is under the mental control of a
wearer, and can wield a weapon, item, or shield
simultaneously in normal two-handed combat, at
no Dexterity penalty. Actions requiring fingers
(picking locks, drawing bows, and so on) are not
possible with the tail.

Shadowcloak
**XP Value:** 3,000 **GP Value:** 30,000
The Complete Thief’s Handbook
This large, cowled cloak is made from pure black
velvet. When worn by a thief, it improves hide in
shadows chances by 25% and makes a thief 50%
likely to be invisible in near darkness (even to
infravision). It can also be used to cast darkness,
darkness 15' radius, and continual darkness once
each per day (at 12th level of magic use). Finally,
once per day a wearer can actually transform into
a shadow for up to 12 turns, becoming a shadow
in all respects save for mental ones (thus, a

wearer cannot be damaged by nonmagical weap-

ons, and undead take the wearer for a shadow and
ignore him or her). Saves against light-based
attacks (for example, a Jight spell cast into the
eyes) are always made at -2 by a wearer of a
shadowcloak.

If a priest successfully makes a turning attempt
against the wearer in shadow form, the cloak
wearer is permitted a saving throw (this is at 4 if
the priest is actually able to destroy shadows). If
the save fails, a wearer suffers 1d6 points of dam-
age per level of the priest and the shadowcloak is
destroyed. If the save is made, a character takes
half damage and must flee in fear at maximum
rate for one turn.

Shaman’s Mantle
**XP Value:** 9,000 **GP Value:** 69,500
Twilight Calling
The shamans mantle lowers a wearer’s Armor

of the Shield

**XP Value:** 1,500 **GP Value:** 10,000
The Magister
A wearer of this cloak can project a shielding
field of invisible force once every two turns,
maintaining and moving the force field by con-
scious mental control. The field lasts up to three
rounds, in the form of a square 10 by 10 inches
across and 4 inches thick. Any wearer can employ
the field without strain within 40 feet as a shield,
for self-protection, or to protect another single
being, so that it acts as a wall of force (as the wiz-
ard spell), a weapon (striking as an invisible ram-
ming force, doing 1d10 points of damage per
blow, one blow per round, no saving throw), as a
bridge or a barrier (like a door), or as a floating
disk (like Tenser’s spell). A wearer can shift the
force field to fulfill any or all of these functions
in any order, but it may serve only in one capacity
per round.

If not maintained by constant mental control (a
wearer cannot be struck unconscious, stunned,
charmed, confused, feebleminded, or psionically
attacked, and cannot cast spells), it ceases to exist
immediately, Attacks upon the field of force do
not affect the cloak. Elminster reports that some
of these cloaks have lost their powers when used
often—and therefore advances the hypothesis
that such cloaks have a limited number of magi-

cal charges or uses before they are exhausted. The
truth of this, it must be stressed, is presently
unknown (DM'’s option).

The inside of this cloak contains four stars
around the neck and front hems, six-pointed
shapes of silver cloth. These are enspelled and
radiate magic. If a star is touched and the name of
its maker spoken (Thalanta the Fair made most of
these cloaks), the star vanishes and the spell
stored within is activated. The knowledge of the
making of such stars is lost, and thus they cannot
be replaced. Moreover, there is nothing to iden-
tify what spell is linked to which star, although a
few sages know the secrets of the patterns the
stars were placed in, and can deduce the spell
each star will trigger. Only one star may be acti-
vated per round; it will cause a spell to be cast as
though by a cloak wearer (regardless of that
being’s class or level), and the spell will take
effect as if cast by a wizard of 20th level, for that
was Thalanta’s level.

The usual spells stored in a cloak of stars vary
according to which of three types of cloaks is
found:

* Type I: Teleport, enchant an item, spir-
itwrack, and limited wish.

* Type Il: Anti-magic shell, repulsion, reverse
gravity, and imprisonment.

¢ Type III: Death spell, legend lore, statue, and
shape change.
Such cloaks are very rare, as the steady attri-
tion of used stars reduces the numbers without
replenishment, and this is especially true of
Type III. The patterns in which the stars were
placed inside the cloaks vary as well. The three
known variations (which do not necessarily cor-
respond to the three types of cloaks as noted
above) are:
¢ Style I: A triangle of three stars inside the
right front throat hem, one star in the center of
the triangle.

¢ Style II: Four stars in a square on the left front
throat hem.

¢ Style III: Two stars down the right front hem

and two stars down the left front hem.

Some speak of a fourth combination—four

hem—but what spells any of these patterns corre-
spond to, only a few sages know or are able to
discover (DM’s option), They can, of course, be
activated without knowing what spell is con-
tained; knowledge of the spell power will fill an
activator’s mind in time for the spell to be directed
at an area or specific target (but not negated or
saved for later).

of Strength
**XP Value:** 3,000 **GP Value:** 30,000
POLYHEDRON Newszine 82

These exquisitely tailored cloaks are made of
dark green velvet and are decorated with a red
gem that rests above the wearer’s heart. When the
wearer touches the gem, a permanent +1 bonus is
added to the character’s Strength (or a +10 to
exceptional Strength to a maximum of 18/00),
then the cloak and gem disappear.

Sumpko’s Mantle
**XP Value:** 1,500 **GP Value:** 15,000
Kara-Tur

If the legends are to be believed, then Sumpko
must certainly be considered the greatest tusu of
the korobokuru race. She (most stories refer to
Sumpko as female) wandered far and wide, even
through the strange lands of the south and into
the netherworld, and much korobokuru folklore
consists of tales of her adventures and the extra-
ordinary things she encountered.

This ancient relic was endowed with magical
power. It supplemented her ability so that she was
a greater wielder of magic than is possible for
normal korobokuru, and it also allowed her to see
into the spirit worlds.

If a wearer is a spellcaster, spells take effect as
if cast by a character three levels higher, regard-
less of racial maximums (Sumpko could have
cast spells as a 10th-level wu jen, though
korobokuru cannot rise above 7th level in that
class). The mantle does not allow characters to
learn spells as if of the higher level, only to cast
the ones permitted by their actual level with
greater efficiency.

The second power of the mantle is to view the
Astral and Ethereal Planes. By concentrating, a
wearer may see into cither of those planes (pro-
vided that the plane intersects the Prime Material
Plane at the wearer’s location). A wearer need not

shpuienemaiineniepentieeenattaeneersiahitiitaasiitariaiiiimmaiee

be a spellcaster for this power to operate,

The one side-effect of the mantle is that when
the wearer is under great stress (as determined by
the DM, but which happens only rarely), he or
she must save vs. spell at -4 or sight becomes
involuntarily focused on the Astral or Ethereal
Plane (equal chances of each) for 3d4 rounds.
This makes a character effectively blind on the
Prime Material Plane.

The mantle is sized to fit a korobokuru,
although it is believed that it resizes itself to fit
any wearer. It is made of the wools of various
northern animals, brightly dyed and woven in
attractive patterns. Tiger fur lines the edges.

Sumpko is believed to have created the mantle
with the assistance of several powerful spirits.
She passed it on to her successor, and so, for
more than a century, it remained in the village;
then it was taken in an attack by hobgoblins and
ogres. It has since appeared in the hands of vari-
ous shamans in every corner of the Ama Basin.
Some are known to have met gruesome deaths.
The mantle is suspected to be controlled by evil
spirits whose attentions were won by eavesdrop-
ping on other planes.

Survival
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 6,000
DRAGON Magazine 112

Any being wearing this cloak gains a +2 bonus
on all saving throws vs. poison and has a -3%
penalty to the chances of contracting any dis-
ease or parasitic infestation. In addition, the
cloak maintains a supply of pure, breathable air,
enough for the wearer to breathe for one turn,
and it replenishes the supply constantly when-
ever the surrounding air is pure. It automati-
cally envelops a wearer’s head whenever
breathable air is not present (if a cloak wearer is
enveloped in choking smoke or plunged into
water, he or she can see, breathe, and act nor-
mally for up to one turn).

Incidentally, a wearer of this cloak is immune
to nausea and its effects, and to the cantrips
belch, cough, sneeze, and yawn. Note that protec-
tion from poisonous vapors lasts one full turn,
and only after that does a cloak wearer save (at
+2) to avoid any effects.

of Symbiotic Protection

**XP Value:** 3,000 **GP Value:** 20,000
DRAGON Magazine 112
This type of cloak is very rare. It is impregnated
with an immobile, nonintelligent living sub-
stance of unknown origin and nature that cannot
be isolated by alchemists and naturalists for
study. The symbiote drains | hit point of vitality
from the wearer every other time it is put on (or,
if worn continuously, once every two days), and
makes the wearer color blind while the cloak is
worn.

In return, the cloak confers immunity to the
effects of green slime, olive slime, obliviax,
violet fungi, yellow musk creeper, yellow mold,
and russet mold (but not brown mold). In addi-
tion the cloak gives a bonus of +4 to saving
throws against spore attacks of all other sorts
(including those of the myconid, ascomoid,
basidirond, and similar creatures). The symbi-
otic life form in the cloak seems to feed upon
and neutralize spores and microscopic, airborne
life of all sorts; in many cases, this ability gives
the wearer a -6% penalty to chances of con-
tracting diseases.

Tiger Cloak of Chalyik

**XP Value:** 1,500 **GP Value:** 12,500
GREYHAWK Adventures
Fashioned from the complete hide of an adult
tiger, the cloak includes the head, skin, and claws,
dangling at the sides. It was the favorite magical
item of the Tiger Lord and the lesser khans, until
it disappeared.

The cloak gives the wearer a +20% reaction
from Tiger Nomads, but a -50% reaction from
Wolf Nomads and tribes of the Burneal Forest. In
melee, the wearer of the cloak enters a berserk
rage and gains a +3 Strength (+50% for fighters
with exceptional 18/00 Strength) to racial mini-
mums, but loses any Dexterity bonus to Armor
Class. If he or she wishes to cease fighting while
live enemies are in sight, the character must save
vs. spell or continue to attack.

Theodolus’s Cloak of Arachnida
**XP Value:** 3,500 **GP Value:** 30,000
1992 Fantasy Collector Card 150
The druid Theodolus is especially proud of this
cloak, because he is especially fond of insects.
Like other cloaks of arachnida, this one allows
him to climb as if a spider climb spell had been

cast upon him, it renders him immune to entrap-
ment by webs of any sort (so he can visit his
friends without disrupting their homes), it
enables him to actually cast a double-sized web
(a talent he loves to rub in the nose of wizards),
and it gives him a +2 bonus to all saving throws
vs. poison. Unlike similar cloaks, this one
allows Theodolus to summon insects (arachnids)
twice a day.

of Warmth
**XP Value:** 1,000

Dracon Dawn
The cloak appears to be an ordinary garment of
gray wool, hanging full and voluminously.
When worn in flight (whether the rider is upon
a dragon’s back or upon another flying mount),
the lengthy folds of the cloak wrap themselves
around a wearer’s body in a magically warm
and insulating embrace. The cloak does not hin-
der motion, and maintains a comfortable tem-
perature regardless of the weather, the knight’s
other garments, or how high an altitude is
reached.

This hooded cloak automatically changes thick-

ness, texture, and style to adapt to almost any nat-

the rain, warm in a blizzard, and pleasantly cool

in a blazing desert.

Wings of the Rakers

**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 9,500
GREYHAWK Adventures
This white cloak was enchanted by a wizard
who found a welcome home among the Griff
Mountains and the Rakers. He especially
enjoyed his time among the aarakocra bird
people, and so he created this item to enhance
his encounters with them. When he neared his
natural death and returned to his home in
Theocracy of the Pale, he passed the cloak on
to a trusted friend, and it has gone from person
to person since.

The cloak acts as wings of flying, except that
wings of the rakers take the appearance of white
seagull wings. The cloak also gives its wearer the
ability to speak and understand the language of

the aarakocra, and to mimic their diving attack

This unusually white cloak increases the magical
effectiveness of several types of spells. [t modifies
saving throws by -2 on all illusionist spells, and by
-3 all hold, charm, suggestion, and confusion
spells of a wizard. These spells are further modi-
fied by a factor of -1 when worn by a female.

Wolf Cloak of Wegwiur
**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 15,000
GREYHAWK Adventures

This magical cloak was made from the hide of a
winter wolf, and includes a wolf’s head, pelt, claws,
and tail. It was enchanted by a priest of the Wolf
Nomads, and since then has served as a tool for
those who seek the swift, sleek power of wolves.

The cloak gives the wearer a +20% reaction
from the wolves of the prairies, but a -50% reac-
tion from Tiger Nomads. In melee, a wearer gains
three Wisdom and four Dexterity points (to racial
maximums). If a character wears this cloak at
night, in the light of the moon, he or she can turn

into a winter wolf (with average statistics) 1d4+3

Cloth

Cloth—fabric formed by weaving or felting—is a
commodity for those who prefer the luxuries of
life, or have delicate skin. Shirts, pants, vests,
socks, and just about any other article of clothing,
can be made from cloth. Magical cloth can be
sewn or otherwise formed into clothing having
the same magical traits as the original bolt of
cloth (unless otherwise stated).

of Cleanliness
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 4,500
DraGon Magazine 73
Any article of clothing made from this material
never needs washing—because it sheds dirt when
left in a dark place overnight.

Merchant’s
**XP Value:** 700 **GP Value:** 7,000
POLYHEDRON Newszine 58

This cloth is made of fine, silvery thread and is
often covered with splotches of oil and grime. If
detect magic is cast on it, the cloth radiates strong
alteration magic. This cloth is favored by merchants
because it increases the apparent value of their
goods. If the cloth is brushed over a nonmagical
item that weighs 25 pounds or less, it improves the
appearance, but not the value, of the object.

The first brush with the cloth removes all heavy
soil and dirt, the second removes all fine dust, the
third adds luster to the object, and the fourth adds a

mirror brightness. After the fourth pass the object

can bring twice its normal value. The fifth pass
causes a magical aura to appear on the object. Fur-
ther brushing with the cloth adds no additional
effect, because the effects are permanent.

of Perfect Fit

times per day. If the strands of the web are col-
lected and spun into cloth (using a spell such as
mending or a carefully deployed major creation
with the web as a material component), a spinner
must wear the cloth for one hour and gain the
ability to commune with the goddess once per
week for 2d4 weeks, Only one being can gain this
benefit and then only if female.

When the bearer of this 8-foot-long cloth utters
the command word (usually found on the cloth),

by someone who knows the martial arts maneu-
ver “steel cloth.” Unlike the regular cloth-used in
the maneuver, this cloth remains straight, even
when not in motion, and rigid until a second com-

used as a crowbar or as a long spike for stopping
sliding walls.

Club

A club is a heavy stick that is usually thicker at
one end than the other. When grasped by the
thinner end, the club can be used as a blud-
geoning weapon. Clubs are generally wooden,
though metal ones do exist. Wooden clubs
often have spikes inserted into the weapon’s fat
end to increase the damage a club can deliver
by 1d2. (See also Cane and Mace.) Roll on the

Daghdha’s avatar wields a club of a highly magi-

heavy end automatically slays a living being (no
saving throw). However, if he reverses the club
and touches a dead being, it grants life (as a raise
dead spell). Daghdha’s avatar also has the ability
to charm any woman, mortal or otherwise, and
bend her to his will.

Druid’s Cudgel
**XP Value:** 750 **GP Value:** 7,500

A druid can fashion this club from the limb of a
freshly dead oak tree. The tree must have been
killed in a natural calamity (as opposed to the
actions of man}—by lightning, drought, blight, or
flood—that did not weaken the wood.

The cudgel must be whittled smooth on the day
preceding a full moon, and then be immersed in
the waters of a Moonwell, from sunset to sunrise,
through the night of a full moon. When removed
in the morning, it is enchanted.

A druid’s cudgel is a +1 magical weapon that
inflicts 1d6+1 points of damage to small and
medium-sized creatures, and 1d4+1 points to
larger victims. It can be enhanced with a shille-
lagh spell, which adds an additional +1 to attack

Coat

A coat is an outer garment with sleeves. It encir-
cles its wearer and is secured with ties, hooks, or
buttons. Coats often have hoods for extra warmth.
Coats are familiar apparel, often made from ani-

resistance, and from the effects of acid, cold, and

disease totally. It also has the following abilities

DUNGEON MASTER Guide, 1st Edition
The High Priest Arnd of Tdon is said to have been
the original owner of this relic. The coat is a
bright and shimmering shirt of fine and almost
weightless chain links. It covers the upper arms,
torso, and groin of any human-shaped wearer of
from 3 feet to 8 feet in height, and makes the
wearer wholly invulnerable to physical attacks
with respect to covered areas, and gives AC 5
protection to all other areas. In addition, the coat
adds +5 to saving throws as if it were +5 magic
armor, protects its wearer from fire as if it were a
ring of fire resistance, and acid, cold, and electri-
cal attacks also have no effect.

Invulnerable Coat of Arnd II
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:**

 

Book of Artifacts
The invulnerable coat of Arnd is a shimmering
coat of fine chain mail, links of pure silver that
cover a wearer’s upper arms, torso, and groin.

Only scant details remain of the people of the
tiny, ancient nation oppressed and impoverished
by the wizard Virtos. All of the champions sent
by the people to free them from Virtos’s yoke
failed. With no one else to take up their cause, the
priests and great craftsmen combined forces to
create a mail coat. This artifact would endow its
wearer with the courage and strength to defeat
Virtos. When the coat was completed, the priests
prayed for a champion.

One week later, Arnd, a humble priest from
the south, entered the city. Arnd’s order
strongly believed in aiding impoverished folk
at every opportunity, and Arnd himself was a
most dedicated follower. Upon learning of the

 

Coat of the Seas _
yA

people’s plight, Arnd agreed to don the coat

and lead the masses into battle. The victory

was a sound one, and Virtos was utterly over-
thrown. After the victory, Arnd disappeared,
taking the coat as a gift.

The invulnerable coat of Arnd is perfect for any
classic, good vs. evil, epic adventure. The PCs
could either find it themselves and use it to swing
the tide in a great war, or perhaps they must pre-
vent another from claiming it for the other side. It
will not unbalance a campaign, for once the quest
is fulfilled, the coat disappears, seeking a new
wearer.

Constant Powers: The coat grows or shrinks
to fit any humanoid character from 3 to 8 feet
tall. The wearer is impervious to any physical
attacks made on a roll of less than a natural 20,
and gains a +5 bonus to all saving throws. The
armor protects against fire attacks as a ring of fire
resistance and is immune to acid, cold, and elec-
trical attacks.

Invoked Powers: A priest wearing the armor
and uttering a special prayer gains three experi-
ence levels for four days (once a month), The
priest gains all hit points, spells, attacks, and sav-
ing throws associated with the new level.

Curse: The spirit of Arnd still inhabits the
armor and attempts to aid the poor whenever pos-
sible. While in the presence of impoverished or
suffering people, there is a 70% chance that the
spirit of Arnd will take possession of the wearer
in order to aid unfortunates. The wearer spends
2d4+1 hours roaming the area, seeking out the
poor and helping them as a 14th-level priest (even
if the character is not a priest). When the spirit of
Arnd releases the character, no memory of what
has happened remains.

Suggested Means of Destruction:

* It must be unraveled by one without con-
science.

* It must be fed to the father of rust monsters.

* A deity of avarice must be forced to wear the
coat, whereupon the magic is released vio-
lently (roll once on Artifact Table 1-01: Cat-
aclysm).

stantly regenerates the character’s air supply. The
coat cannot create food and water, so rescue must
be quick if the wearer is unprepared.

Coffin

Coffins are wooden or metal boxes measuring
between 3 and 9 feet long, and | to 6 feet wide.
They are designed to hold corpses when the dead
are burried and return to the soil, to their final
resting place. Most nonmagical coffins are
intended to last for only a few years, and they do
not protect the body from the elements or from
scavengers.

GREYHAWK Adventures

Priests of Furyondy first enchanted this finely
engraved, wooden coffin to preserve the bodies of
the honorably deceased. Any lawful good priest
can activate its powers by placing into the casket
the body of a human or demihuman not more than
nine days dead, then casting a bless spell upon the
body. The casket preserves the body from decay
indefinitely. A deceased character can be returned
to life by a resurrection spell after any length of
time. For purposes of resurrection system shock,
the subject’s Constitution is considered to be three
points above the current ability score (no maxi-
mum). He or she also receives the benefits of heal
once the resurrection is complete.

DUNGEON Magazine 21

Each of these stone devices is attuned to a differ-
ent type of undead. When a humanoid body is
placed in a coffin of creation, the magic of the
device takes 48 hours to create the specific type
of undead for which the coffin was enchanted.

The resulting undead creature is unusually
intelligent for its type. In addition to its undead
abilities, it retains many of the powers (includ-
ing spellcasting) it had when alive. As long as
its body lies in the coffin, the undead creature
is mystically linked to its former shell and can
be controlled by threatening to destroy its
remains.

Crystal Coffin

The ruling wizards of a long-dead civilization

mered brass plate. The fittings and hinges are
also brass. While the materials themselves are
worth at least 1,000 gp, the coffin weighs 200 lbs.
and is bulky enough to require four bearers.
Under the scrutiny of a detect magic spell, the

**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** 500
GREYHAWK Adventures
This cursed item was created not to harm its
owner, but to benefit those in need. It is a seem-
ingly normal platinum coin that affects any char-
acter who intends to keep it, and not to share it
with others. That character must save vs. spell or
be overwhelmed by noble, philanthropic emo-
tions, No matter what a character’s alignment, he
or she wants to give wealth to the poor and needy.
A character cannot keep more than 50 gp at any
one time, and instead holds extra money only
until a suitable NPC (preferably a beggar or a

peasant) accepts the money as a gift. Such gen-
erosity does not extend to a character’s magical
items, which are generally useless to laborers and
farmers. Uncontrollable generosity can be ended
only by remove curse.

Bloodcoin
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** 50
Forbidden Lore
For many, the sin of avarice has been so tempting
that all other considerations are set aside. This
small token is a symbol of that seductive evil. As
is often the case, its simple and pleasing appear-
ance belies the great malevolence that lingers
within its metal body.

Description: This coin resembles a normal sil-
ver piece. The engravings on the face and back
always appear to be just what the owner expects.
If it is found in a strange Jand, the owner likely
expects it to be a coin of that realm. Otherwise he
or she is most likely to see it as one stamped with
the markings of the possessor’s homeland. Since
the markings of coins are of little interest to most
adventurers, it can be passed from person to per-
son and no one can see anything strange. In fact,
if one person takes the coin and pronounces out
loud the stamp upon it, anyone in earshot who is
given the coin expects to see the stamp, and of
course, they do. The only distinguishing mark on
the coin is a small red smudge that cannot be
wiped off. Casual handling does not reveal the
red stain.

History: Hoorku Mishkov was a young mer-
chant in Borca. Charm, avarice, and deception
were his hallmarks. Most Borcan merchants
stayed within the borders of Borca and Dorvinia,
plying their goods along those well-known, safe
routes. Their profit margin was narrow, but
enough to live comfortably. Hoorku was con-
vinced that he could make a larger profit by set-
ting off for new lands. His aspirations for greater
wealth led him to consider exploring a route
down the south road, a road rarely used. With a
small caravan of goods, he set off to find rich new
trade routes,

The road south led to Gundarak. In that foul
land he lost his entire caravan. Lord Gundar’s son
took the whole thing as “tribute.” He allowed the
young merchant to keep one item of his choice.
Rather than taking a horse so that he could return
quickly to Borea, the foolish merchant kept an

enchanted gem. The enchantment of the stone

merely allowed it to glow when it touched true
silver,

Rather than heading for home, the intrepid
Hoorku journeyed downstream into the misty
land of Invidia. There he met a Vistani woman in
a colorful wagon by the water. She was young,
only 20 years of age, but her heart was bitter.
Unknown to Hoorku, this was Gabrielle Aderre,
at that time a new dark lord of Ravenloft. Her bit-
terness stemmed from her mother’s warning to
never bear children, lest she bring monstrous evil
into the world.

Hoorku saw an opportunity for profit in
Gabrielle. He wooed her ardently, intending to
steal what he could of her money. She was flat-
tered, but she spurned him with the tale of her
mother’s dire prediction. In a flash of inspiration,
Hoorku produced the magical gem and claimed it
would allow a woman to birth a normal, healthy,
good-natured child, no matter the race or disposi-
tion of either parent, Gabrielle’s desire to break
the bonds of her curse overrode her prudence and
she let Hoorku seduce her. Of course, he made
her pay him for the gem, extracting every coin in
her possession.

Later, while Hoorku lay sleeping, Gabrielle
used her magic to determine the workings of
the gem. She immediately discovered its true
worth. In her fury, she almost slew her young
suitor in his sleep. Then the snake of an evil
idea began to coil about her mind. With her
magic, she caused Hoorku to sleep for many
days. During that time she fashioned the b/oad-
coin. Gabrielle found that creating such a
cursed item was something that she could now
do easily as the Lord of Invidia.

Before letting the knavish merchant awaken,
Gabrielle place the bloodcoin in his purse.
Unaware of how long he had lain sleeping,
Hoorku set off for the village of Karina. He
promised to return by nightfall, although he
really intended to buy a horse and return to
Borca. In the village, he could not resist short-
changing the stable master. Blood ran from his
eyes, frightening the poor man to death.

Confused and alarmed, Hoorku tried to wash
his face, only to find that he was unable to stem
the flow of red. The foul magic of the coin let him
know immediately that it was responsible for his
plight. He stole a horse and fled the village. That
night he dreamed of Gabrielle. In the dreams, she
told him what she had done, and that the coin was

his curse for betraying her.

To this day, horror stories are told of a weeping
beggar in blood-soaked clothes. He has wandered
Borca and Dorvinia for years, trying to give away
a silver coin. Legend has it that to take the coin is
to assume the curse of the weeping beggar. In
truth, Hoorku Mishkov died a broken man,
clutching a silver coin. Gabrielle Aderre now dis-
trusts and despises all men, partially due to
Hoorku’s betrayal.

Powers: If examined with detect magic, the
coin shows a faint aura of alteration. Anyone pos-
sessing this coin is able to cheat or swindle any
living creature without getting caught. Creatures
with magic resistance get to check for their resis-
tance to the coin. The swindle can occur during
any exchange of properties. The owner could
convince a wealthy merchant that a bit of broken
pottery is worth 10,000 gp. The purchaser ts
under no particular geas to buy, but is utterly con-
vinced of the value of the item. In most cases, he
or she goes ahead with the exchange unless there
are other immediate and pressing needs for what
would be lost. .

The Curse: For every gold piece of value
that the owner swindles, he or she sheds tears of
blood, weeping one round per silver piece swin-
dled, or 10 rounds per gold piece. The victim
cannot feel the tears running down his or her
face, but they are plainly visible to everyone
else. The blood stains anything it touches—
clothes, bedding, even saddles. These are nor-
mal blood stains that can be washed out if
caught quickly.

Anyone seeing the owner’s eyes dripping
blood must roll a horror check. This is a rela-
tively mild event and, therefore, a +2 bonus
applies. The bonus does not apply if the owner’s
clothing, face, or gear is covered in blood. For
example, a character who falls asleep weeps
through the night, drenching everything in
blood. Anyone seeing the character just before
waking would truly be horrified at the sight of
this person lying in a large pool of blood. Even
the owner of the bloodcoin must roll a horror
check (no bonus) at the first realization of what
is happening. After that, the victims don’t need
to roll further horror checks. However, if the
horror check fails, the effects are permanent
until the coin is eliminated.

If the owner of the bloodcoin is not currently
weeping, a quick fortune may be made. Once the
weeping begins, he or she is unlikely to be able to
spend the money. A character could well go cold
and hungry, sleeping in a damp alley on a pile of
coins. Thieves might soon steal those ill-gotten
gains, assuming that they were not frightened
away by the victim’s appearance.

Anyone weeping blood can be automatically
trailed and hunted by animals or creatures
using the sense of smell. Rangers and the like
get a +4 bonus to track the victim. Vampires
can scent the blood at a distance of 100 feet per
age category.

Until the first time the owner attempts to swin-
dle or cheat someone, the coin can be given or
thrown away. It cannot be used for a purchase
unless it is the last coin in the person’s purse (oth-
erwise, the coin automatically returns to the purse
and is replaced by a coin of the same or higher
value from the purse). Once its possessor tries to
cheat someone, the coin becomes attached to its
new owner and helps with the bargain. The power
of the coin can be felt at work, and the victim is
aware that it is responsible for any success. From
that point on, the coin appears to be coated in
dried blood that cannot be wiped away.

Once it has found an owner, the coin is not eas-
ily discarded. If given away or used to make a
purchase, it reappears in the owner’s purse, and a
coin of like or greater value from that purse
replaces it. If thrown away, the same thing hap-
pens, with another coin taking the place of the
lost bloodcoin. It remains out of its owner’s
pocket so long as he or she stays within 30 feet of
it. It cannot be melted or destroyed by normal
means.

To be rid of it, the owner must give away all
earthly possessions and wander the world as a
beggar for a full year. The only possessions
now permitted are rags for clothes and the
bloodcoin itself. At the end of the year, the vic-
tim is able to give it to any person of his or her

choice. Nothing can be purchased with the

coin, nor can it be thrown away. The character
must find someone willing to accept the coin.
He or she does not have to explain the nature of
the bloodcoin to whoever takes it, however,
most folk are not likely to want to take a blood-
encrusted coin.

This is a copper piece about an inch in diameter.
One face shows an elderly, bearded man with a
wise expression. On the reverse is the image of a
castle.

This coin allows the holder to locate, with
great precision, the other four coins that arrived
with this one (the silver, electrum, gold, and plat-
inum coins). The user has an instinctive feeling
about the direction they lie in, and sometimes
senses instructions from the makers.

The user is attuned to the rhythms of the

Oriental Adventures
These coins are actually copper discs, each
engraved with a specific symbol. There are
always eight coins in a set. When the coins are
tossed and the command word is spoken, the

fate (as a fate spell).

Electrum
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 5,000
Five Coins for a Kingdom
This is a large electrum coin of excellent crafts-
manship. On one side is a picture of an elderly
woman. Her eyes are alert and her chin is held
high. Her hair is tied back in a tight knot. The

reverse shows the outline of a city.

A user may cast mental illusions that appear
real to all the senses of a viewer. No illusion may
be larger than the user. A user can deceive any
given individual once per day with one illusion.
He or she can specify which person or monster in
a group sees a specific illusion. For example, a
bandit leader might see an approaching sheriff,
but other bandits in the group could see some-
thing different—a fleeing cat, dusk, or a tuba. A
user always sees and controls the illusions the
victims witness.

A user has no qualms about puncturing a rival’s
pretensions with a harmless prank. Affect an
amused skepticism toward any overly serious
endeavor. Basically, the holder turns into a gad-
fly: biting, annoying, provocative.

Equus
**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 8,000
DUNGEON Magazine 22

An equus coin is a magical piece coinage that,
upon command, polymorphs into some form of a
beast of burden. The word “equus” (plural “equi”)
comes from an ancient language and has no lit-
eral translation in the common tongue. The clos-
est translation is “beast of burden” or “horse,” but
the word can be applied to anything that is used
like a horse. Thus, an actual horse, mule, worg,
camel, dog-sled team, nightmare, or any other
creature that can be ridden, used to pull a load, or
carry goods can be termed an equus. Equi come
in many different varieties, with the most com-
mon listed below. While 80% of equi are either
good or neutrally aligned, 20% polymorph into
evil creatures such as nightmares, worgs, and
giant spiders. It is said that the death knight Shan
Nikkoleth once possessed an eguus that polymor-
phed into gorgon form.

This large silver or gold coin is always broader
and thicker than a standard silver or gold piece.
One face is stamped with the command word for
the item and the other with the creature it
becomes.

Creature List
A DM may choose the form of the creature into
which the equus polymorphs from the following
table. The coin form polymorphs into one type of
creature only. A DM who prefers to roll randomly
should add the roll of 1d8 to that of 1d12 and con-

sult the table below. The DM should use only a
1,133

creature he or she feels comfortable with and is
sure will not give the PC an unfair advantage in the
campaign. Types of creatures can be added to or
deleted from the list as the DM sees fit. Any of the
following creatures that do not appear on Table 49
in the PHB should be considered equal to a heavy
horse in movement rate and encumbrance.

If the equus is slain (reduced to 0 hit points or
less) in creature form, the creature immediately
reverts to coin form and cannot change into crea-
ture form again. Damage to the creature form of
the equus can be healed magically by cure wounds
spells. If the creature is allowed food and rest, it
heals naturally at the rate of 1 hit point per day.
However, the equus can neither heal itself nor be
healed while in coin form.

The portrait side shows a balding man with
plump cheeks, heavily lidded eyes, and a gloomy
expression, On the reverse is a stately building
resembling a crypt.

The user may create potions up to three times

a small quantity of liquid. The liquid is instantly
transmuted into a potion of the user’s choice. Just
one dose of potion is created; larger quantities of
liquid merely dilute the effects.

of Jisan the Bountiful

**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** —
Book of Artifacts
Prized by merchants and feared by caliphs, the
coin of Jisan the Bountiful is a simple gold coin
the size of a dinar, bearing the symbol of Jisan on
both sides. It is found only in Zakhara, the Land
of Fate.

The coin of Jisan is as old as the goddess and
1,135

 

322

\
Sooo

~

has most frequently been found among her wor-
shipers. It is said to be bestowed upon the worthy
by Jisan or by Fate herself, giving them riches
and wisdom, fertility and long life. The coin is a
gift that is meant to be shared. Those who try to
hold it longer than their appointed span suffer for
their greed; no one is known to have held the coin
of Jisan for more than seven years.

Caliphs fear the coin’s bounty because they
cannot control it, and some owners of the coin
have grown so popular that they have led revolts
against oppressive caliphs. Wiser caliphs have
married their daughters to those blessed by the
coin, thus gaining its wealth.

The coin of Jisan is sometimes given by Fate to
those who act for noble purposes, and to this end
it may come into the possession of the PCs, per-
haps as a reward for a mission that produced or
restored bounty—ending a magical drought,
reopening a major trade route, or lifting repres-
sive taxes. Although it can be used without fear
by the good- hearted, it always attracts jealousy
and greed in others. The dao, in particular, have
long coveted the coin of Jisan, and they and
others will seek to steal it at every opportunity. If
the holy slayers of the Gilded Palm ever decide it
belongs to someone more worthy (such as them-
selves), they will threaten, extort, or even kill to
get it. Thus, mere possession of the coin creates a
web of adventures for the PCs.

Constant Powers: The owner gains the
appraisal, haggling, and debate proficiencies, or a
+4 bonus to already existent skills, None of the
owner’s businesses ever suffer misfortune, fields
and palms always yield richly, and all livestock
give birth to twins.

Invoked Powers: The owner can use the plant
growth and suggestion spells (both at will) and
the weather control spell (1/month).

Random Powers: Four from Artifact Table
1-12: Fate and Fortune, one from Artifact
Table 1-21: Personal Enhancements.

Curse: Those who use the coin to help others
are unaffected by any curse, but help must be
given without expectation of reward or gain.
Those who use the coin to gain palaces, treasures,
and power are stricken with unquenchable hunger
that grows in proportion to their greed. Eventu-
ally the character must spend every waking hour
devouring barrels of tea and coffee, bushels of
grain, and whole oxen. To be rid it, the coin must
be given to a stranger.

of Luck
(Coin of Greed)
**XP Value:** 15,000 **GP Value:** 75,000
Tales of the Lance
This innocent-looking copper coin has two faces.
Both depict a fat, heavily jowled merchant. One
side smiles ingratiatingly and the other side
sneers in open-mouthed scorn.

The coin grants luck indeed—good luck for
Hiddukel and bad luck for any mortal who
comes across it. One encounter with the coin of
luck occurred when Balcombe, an initiate into
the Order of the Red Robes, failed the Test of
Sorcery and ended up a splintered and smolder-
ing pulp outside the Tower of High Sorcery. The
coin of luck appeared in his hand, and his ruined
body was renewed to life. Then Hiddukel,
speaking through the coin, offered a deal—Bal-
combe could remain alive and avenge himself
on the wizards who slew him if he promised to

 

323

1,136
*
serve Hiddukel. Balcombe agreed, only then
discovering that Hiddukel required him to trap
the life forces of Krynn’s folk in magic jars and
feed them to the insatiable god. Hiddukel
planned, at the next opportune stellar conjunc-
tion, to draw the life forces from the jars and
feast upon them.

As might be expected, Balcombe was killed in
the commission of his duties, and the coin found
its way into the pack of one Tasslehoff Burrfoot.
It could be anywhere now.

The coin of luck acts as a luckstone, occasion-
ally adding a bonus of +2 to any die roll (roll 1d6:
odd = +2, even = +0).

Through the coin’s opposite faces, Hiddukel
can speak to the bearer. The grinning side speaks
when Hiddukel is in a good mood and the sneer-
ing side speaks when he feels foul. The coin peri-
odically flips sides in the bearer’s hand when
Hiddukel’s mood changes. Hiddukel grants the
coin of luck only to those with whom he knows he
has a bargain that cannot be refused.

Once the coin reveals itself as a tool of Hid-
dukel and the owner agrees to enter into a pact
with Hiddukel, however, all the coin of luck'’s
powers activate. Once per day, the bearer of the
coin can cast continual darkness 15-foot radius.
Once per turn the bearer can also cast suggestion
on anyone. These suggestions are used to sew dis-
sent and discord. The coin can create an antimagic
area with a 20-foot radius at Hiddukel’s will. Hid-
dukel summons this ability to place his minion at
a disadvantage so that he must bargain further
with the god of betrayal for his life. Once per day,
the coin also casts blight and bestow curse, the
reverse of bless and remove curse.

Anyone invoking one of the greater powers of
the coin must make a system shock roll each time
or become terrified and lose 1 point of Charisma.
The user of the coin becomes more corrupted,
jealous, and greedy. Eventually the coin brings
downfall to any using it.

This coin of greed is part of a Triad of Betrayal,
created and inhabited by Hiddukel. Although
Reorx forged the coin, Hiddukel imbued it with
magic to thwart the designs of the goddess of
love, Mishakal. The coin of greed, like the other
artifacts of the Betrayal Triad, pursues an artifact
of the Circle of Love all around the face of Krynn.
The coin of luck seeks to destroy the amulet of the
healing spirit.

Platinum

**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 10,000
Five Coins for a Kingdom
This is a heavy platinum coin. It is obviously very
valuable. The woman shown in profile on one
side has a stately expression and looks like a
queen or noblewoman. The woman appears to be
in her mid-forties. On the reverse is what looks
like a simple stone block—perhaps some kind of
altar.

The holder may control any one creature (up to
20 HD) per day, up to the following midnight. A
victim gets a saving throw vs. spell to avoid con-
trol, but a user can keep trying once per round if
the attempt fails. A holder must see a victim to
control its actions. A controlled creature cannot
be forced to kill itself. A holder can’t fight or cast
spells while controlling others, but can move up
to half normal rate.

A user has a streak of haughtiness—or more
politely, a great deal of self-confidence. He or she
should be ready to charge any foe, greet every
noble as an equal, and disdain to take guff from
anyone.

Raistlin’s Cursed Money

**XP Value:** **GP Value:** 100
Tales of the Lance
During the Dwarfgate Wars, Raistlin (or Fistan-
dantilus) made a deal with the dark dwarves.
They betrayed their king and left the gates of Pax
Tharkas open when Raistlin’s army attacked. A
victorious Raistlin paid the dark dwarves 100,000
steel coins.

The coins were cursed, however, to prevent the
dark dwarves from double-crossing the wizard. If
the owner of one of these coins goes back on his
or her spoken word, the flesh of the owner’s hands
begins to turn black and rot away. This dread

curse spreads slowly to the rest of the body until
1,139

the victim dies.

The legendary effect of this money occurs
only when the money is actually part ofa
promise. (If an NPC pays a PC in Raistlin’s
cursed money to stand guard, and the PC flees
with the money, the curse will claim the charac-
ter.) A person under the curse suffers 1d4 points
of damage from rotting each day until he or she
either makes good on the promise, receives a
remove curse, or dies.

Returning Penny

**XP Value:** 50 **GP Value:** 250
DRAGON Magazine 30
The returning penny may be the source of a well-
known cliché. When cast away from the bearer,
this piece will teleport to the user’s hand from as
far as 30 feet away. It will avoid all obstacles on
its return flight.

Silver
**XP Value:** 400 **GP Value:** 2,000
Five Coins for a Kingdom

This is a small, finely crafted silver piece. On one
side is the profile of a young man with a high
forehead, a noble nose and chin, a full head of
hair, and a faint smile. On the reverse is a dragon
whose proportions make it look very young,
almost babylike.

The holder can polymorph (as the wizard spell)
three times a day for up to an hour each time. The
shape assumed can be smaller or lighter, but no
larger or heavier than the user. A user cannot
acquire any of the special abilities of the new
shape except natural ones. For instance, if a user
becomes a crow, flight is possible, but if a user
becomes a gorgon, he or she cannot turn anyone
to stone.

A user feels high-spirited, boastful, and ready
to challenge any who question his or her abilities.

Collar

Although the piece of jewelry known as a collar
is usually an ornate, gem-studded leather or metal
band, magical collars are quite different. Many
appear as simple rags, often dirty but never tat-
tered. To gain a collar’s magical effects, the owner
must wear it around his or her neck.

~ Collar of Disguise cr

of Change
**XP Value:** 4,000 **GP Value:** 20,000
Falcon’s Revenge
The collar that the Falcon uses to perform
Shapechanging is a rare, possibly unique, magical
item. It was created as a ring by an unknown wiz-
ard and stolen by the Falcon before its enchant-
ment was complete. Whether another one was
created (the Falcon had it enlarged to fit her neck)
is unknown.

The collar allows the Falcon to change shape
three times per day. She may choose any living
form: humanoid or monstrous, or a form she cre-
ates herself. She is able to combine any elements
to create new appearances at will, including
bizarre creatures such as feathered frogs or giant,
furry earthworms.

The complete transformation requires one
round and the Falcon may not perform any action
while the transformation is in progress. Once the
transformation is complete, the Falcon receives
all the natural abilities of the creature she resem-
bles, but none of the magical abilities. For exam-
ple, in the form of a dragon, she would receive
the claw and bite attacks of a dragon as well as
flight, but she would not have spell ability nor a
breath weapon.

If the Falcon is rendered unconscious or is
killed while in an alternate form, she immediately
reverts to her natural, spirit naga form. The collar
may be used only by members of the wizard and
priest classes.

These collars range from plain strips of leather to
ornate, jeweled bands of fur and chain. The col-
lars were originally made by a Ravens Bluff wiz-
ard who was worried about his pets’ safety. He
designed them to function only on small- and
medium-sized creatures of animal intelligence or
less. Some collars are more powerful than others,
having from +1 to +5 protection bonuses.

of Strangling

This collar is identical to a collar of disguise.
However, it starts to strangle its wearer as soon as
it is worn. A wearer dies in one turn unless
remove curse is applied within that time. With
this remedy, the collar bursts into flames that
destroy it and inflict 3d6 points of severe fire
damage to a wearer (no saving throw). The burns
can be cured only by ointment of soothing or a
heal spell. Any victim strangled for three rounds
or more is unable to talk for 1d4 days or until a
heal spell is applied.

This adamantite neck shield was enchanted by a wiz-
ard who held an unnatural fear of decapitation. He
wore it until his death, though the collar gave no pro-
tection against the magical spells that killed him. The
collar offers no Armor Class bonus, but provides
immunity from decapitation, especially from vorpal
weapons. Full damage is still received, but a wearer
still has his or her head attached.

Wolf Collar
**XP Value:** 800 **GP Value:** 4,000
New Item
This spiked, black leather collar fits around the
neck of nearly any fairly ordinary humanoid,
and it can be adjusted for size. The wearer need
only speak the command word, “Fenris,” to be
transformed into a dire wolf wearing a spiked
collar.

Dire Wolf: AC 6; MV 18; HD 4+4; hp 36; THACO
15; AT 1; Dmg 2-8; SZ L.

A character retains all memories and skills,
but has otherwise completely adopted the form
of the wolf. He or she instinctively knows the
skills and abilities of the wolf, suffering no
penalties on any actions attempted while in
wolf form. To revert to ordinary form, a charac-
ter need only growl the command word again.
Any damage taken in the wolf form is ignored
by a character, but the collar takes the damage
inflicted on the wolf form. Once the collar has
taken 36 hit points, it is forever destroyed. It
can heal damage as an ordinary wolf, and it can
take healing spells to revitalize it.

Other wolves sense the magic of the collar, and
shun a wearer for that reason. Other dire wolves
fear and hate the wolf created by the collar, and
will attack the wearer if they are not immediately
cowed by a show of strength.

Comb of the Korrigans

**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** —
Dunceons & Dracons Master Set
A group of nine powerful elves took a rare wood-
land creature (the korrigan) as their symbol. Suc-
cessful as a mortal group, they resumed their close
friendship after all reached immortality. Together
they created this item to assist mortal elves reach
immortality, only aiding those mortals who strive
toward representing the best of elvenkind. The kor-
rigans became nearly legendary in mortal life,
commonly using shapechanging and haste in their
travels and combats, and this device presumably
bestows similar powers.

This is a hair comb, 5 inches long, made of a
pink, bonelike substance, with fine teeth. The
comb is not active when acquired. If it is left
within a burning fire for one full turn, it is acti-
vated, but will not reveal powers. After that,

whenever the user befriends an elf (lending
1,150

money, curing, aiding in battle), one power is
revealed telepathically (maximum of one per
day), in order of power.

A power is invoked when a certain combina-
tion of the comb’s teeth are plucked, producing a
nearly inaudible musical tone.

Suggested Powers: (All abilities are cast at
20th level.)

* Poison breath (Effect 30x10 feet; damage
is equal to the user’s current hit points with
saving throw applicable.)

* Haste (Range 240 feet; duration three turns;
affects 24 creatures in 60-foot-radius.)

* Produce fire

* Cure disease

* Cure wounds, critical

* Polymorph self

Suggested Handicaps: When the first power
is used, the user starts turning into an elf; the
process takes three months to complete. The user
becomes aware of minor changes (animosity
toward dwarves, among other things) in two
weeks. The change stops completely as soon as
the artifact is no longer owned, but the change
back to normal takes three months.

* Energy drain: User loses three levels of expe-
rience when poison breath is first used.

 

Cone of Communication

 

Suggested Penalties: (1st appears 1-4 on 1d6,

others each | in 6):

* Slow spell effect centered on user.

* Polymorph other spell effect upon user, to turn
into an eagle.

+ Memory penalty. User cannot memorize any
spells of the highest spell level he or she can nor-
mally study. Effect is cumulative if not removed.

Cone of Communication
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 9,000
Greyspace
Each cone is a simple, solid cone of an unknown
white material, as cold and hard as stone, but
much lighter. Each is 4 inches in diameter at the
base, and 6 inches high. Each weighs less than

one pound.

Cones of communication are purchased and
used only in pairs. Each cone is matched with a
single other cone, and does not work with any
other. If someone speaks into the base of one
cone, the voice sounds clearly, and at the same
volume, from the base of the matched cone. In
fact, the cones communicate not only voices,
but any sound that originates from a point no
more than 12 inches from the base of one of the
cones.

A pair of cones has a maximum range of 1d12
thousand miles. (The range is apparently character-
istic of the particular pair, and unchangeable by any
means.) Within that range, two people, each pos-
sessing one of the pair, can speak to each other nor-
mally, with no decrease in volume and no
measurable time delay. As soon as the range is
exceeded, both cones become totally inert and non-
magical until they come back within operating
range again. When the two cones are in range of
each other, both radiate an aura of evocation. When
they are out of range, they appear totally nonmagi-
cal to all forms of analyses. Apart from moving out
of range or placing both halves of the pair in sound-
proof containers, there is no way to shut them off.

Obviously, cones of communication are very
useful to spelljamming captains who have to coor-
dinate the actions of multiple vessels. Since sound
does not cross the vacuum of wildspace between
two distant vessels, captains have to resort to flags,
pennants, or other devices to communicate. With a
pair of cones, the captains of two vessels can dis-
cuss their options and coordinate plans as if they
were both on the same bridge. Some military ana-
lysts claim that the greatest elven fleet victories in

 

327

Fireproof Container

 

the first Unhuman War were achieved because the
fleet commander had one pair of cones for each of
his important vessels. He gave one of each pair to
each subordinate captain, and kept the other cone
on his own bridge. By selecting the right cones he
could issue changes in orders to any captain, or
receive reports. (Obviously, in such a case it is
important to mark the cones in some noticeable
way to tell them apart).

The first pair of cones was used in Greyspace
several centuries ago. A spelljamming wizard
named Naxtys claimed that she had created
them, and used that claim to bolster her reputa-
tion. It was not long before other wizards
decided that Naxtys was simply not competent
enough to come up with something so original.
When pressed by her magical colleagues, she
finally admitted that she had found the first pair,
stored in a protective case of obsidian, floating
in wildspace somewhere in the Grinder. Almost
immediately, other wizards who were more
competent than Naxtys could ever hope to be
created more pairs of cones. To this day, nobody
knows who created the first cones. Certain wild-
eyed fantasists claim they were created by an
ancient race of powerful wizards who lived on
the planet that was eventually shattered to
become the Grinder, and that Naxtys found them

ee

floating there. Most people consider this
absolute garbage, of course. As with so many
magical items, the price for a pair of cones of
communication is whatever the market will bear.
The lowest recorded price paid for a pair was
11,000 gp, and each year the highest price paid
reaches more rarified heights.

Container

A container is a scroll tube, box, or case designed
to protect its contents from water, air, or fire.
Watertight containers also tend to be buoyant, so
they will not sink and be lost if accidentally
dropped into the water. Roll on the table below to
determine the type of container found. In order to
increase the possibilities, a DM may choose to
roll on the random charts available in many of the

**XP Value:** 200 **GP Value:** 1,000

New Item

The first of these items was manufactured by a
wizard who enjoyed wandering through the Ele-
mental Plane of Fire. This pyrophile was tired
of losing his gear to the intense heat intrinsic to
that plane. He magically enhanted the contain-
ers that held his gear, trying to protect the con-
tents from the heat. Unfortunately, he found
that when a container was opened, the gear was
exposed to the intense heat, and all his labor
was for naught. Needless-to-say, he soon aban-
doned the enchanted gear, opting instead for
normal protections. Still, fireproof containers
are handy for average adventurers or homeown-
ers to have, as they indeed protect the contents
from all nonmagical fire. They also grant a 45%
magic resistance and a +5 to all saving throws
vs. magical fire.

Contracts of Nepthas

**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 5,000
Tome of Magic
These magical contracts are written in black ink
on golden brown vellum. They are usually found
in ivory tubes, each tube containing 1d6 con-
tracts. The contracts are blank, to be filled in by
the user.

The contracts radiate magic if that is detected
for, but carry no overt signs of their special
nature. A contract of Nepthas automatically
places an enchantment upon all who sign it, in
order to insure that both parties hold to the agree-
ment. Anyone who has signed a contract of
Nepthas and breaks the contract is struck deaf,
blind, and dumb. The effects of the punishment
last until they are removed with a remove curse
spell.

A person who is both deaf and blind suffers a
-8 penalty on attack rolls, while opponents gain a
+8 bonus. A character loses all bonuses for Dex-
terity and suffers a -2 penalty to saving throws
vs. spell, petrification, polymorph, and rod, staff,
or wand.

A contract involves two parties and an
agreed set of conditions. The conditions are
usually very specific, but if they are not, they
might be perverted in the same way that a wish
spell might be misinterpreted. If a group of
adventurers signs a contract with a king stating
that they will slay a dragon in the Northern
Hills by the eve of the new moon, slaying any
dragon fulfills the contract, even if the king
had a specific dragon in mind. If the king
agreed to pay the adventurers upon the comple-

tion of their task, he had better have the money
when the party returns.

Contracts signed by those under the influence
of charm and similar spells are null and void. A
forged contract is also void. If any person signs a
contract and dies before its completion, the oblig-
ation is ended for both parties. If a group of
adventurers signs a contract and one of their
members dies, the survivors are still bound to the
contract. A deadline for both parties’ responsibili-
ties must be stated in the contract in order for it to
be activated.

Control Doll

**XP Value:** 1,800 **GP Value:** 9,000

DraGOn Magazine 43
Dolls are made to fit general categories—a man
or a woman, a troll, a dragon. To work, an
organic sample of the specific target (some nail
clippings, locks of hair, bits of outer skin, or
scales) must be made part of the doll. Once the
organic material is added, the doll acquires a
focus. The doll now must be shown to the
intended victim. If the victim fails to save vs.
spell, the victim is charmed (like a charm per-
son spell). The charm lasts as long as the doll is
intact and in the charmer’s possession. If the
controller loses the doll or the doll is destroyed
or damaged, the charm is broken.

Cord
A cord is made of several braided and woven
strands of fiber twisted together into one long,
tough thread. Basically nothing more than thick
string or strong yarn, cord is used much the same
as rope, but is generally weaker and used in less
demanding circumstances. (See Rope.)

of Binding

**GP Value:** 12,000
Dracon Dawn
A cord of binding is made of spider silk,
enchanted to obey a command word to tie a per-
son fast. When tossed to the ground within 3 feet
of its target, the line coils itself around a victim,
securing limbs to body with knots. This action
counts as an attack, and succeeds on an attack roll
of 5 or better. The target receives no benefits due
to Armor Class, but Dexterity adjustments can
make it more difficult for the cord to hit. No
attack roll is needed to restrain unconscious or
unresisting targets.

Cord of Ekbir

The 10-foot long cord is sufficient to restrain
one large humanoid, two human-sized creatures
(if bound together), or three smaller ones, such as
kender. It uncoils and drops to the ground when
the command word is spoken backward. Usually
only the maker or owner of a cord of binding
knows the magical command, which is not
inscribed on the line in any fashion.

A cord can only be cut with difficulty. It with-
stands 10 points of damage before being severed,
and is allowed a save vs. crushing blow to see if
any damage is inflicted by a given attack. It is
impossible to snap the strands if less than 30
Strength points are applied. A broken or severed
cord of binding loses its enchantment and

becomes ordinary rope.

of Ekbir
**XP Value:** 450 **GP Value:** 4,500
GREYHAWK Adventures
Since strangulation is the favorite attack method
of assassins and thieves in the civilized north-
west, a magical garrote was destined to appear in
the hands of Ekbiran murderers. This black cord
strikes with a +1 attack modifier and forces the
victim to save vs. spell or be stunned and unable

to resist the attack.
Faithful Knot

The faithful knot is actually a foot-long cord that,

else. This cord can be cut by a sword stroke or

similar action.

These lines are only found in crypts, treasure
vaults, ruins, and other places that have long
been undisturbed. Made of a now-lost fiber that
neither rots nor frays, these cords can be cut
only by magical or silver weapons. Typically 2
to 4 feet in length, such cords usually have a
number of enspelled knots tied in them. Untying
the knot unleashes its magical effects. Much
research and experimentation must be under-
taken to learn the process of enspelling these
knots (which are only effective when tied in a
cord of this type), but the knots are easily tied,
recognized, and untied.

(iii

Enspelled and ordinary knots are identical in
appearance, and many cords have ordinary
knots with enspelled ones as safeguards or to
deceive buyers. Feared wizards such as Sespetar
and Turgohn the Two-Fingered are known to
wear such cords as belts when they travel. Pow-
ers of some of the known knots follow. Untying
one type calls up a strong, steady wind lasting
3d12 turns, which blows in the direction at
which the person untying the knot points the
free end of the cord. Such winds have been used
to aid navigation at sea, cause storms, and drive
vessels onto rocks.

Another knot calls down a flame strike upon
anyone within 200 feet that the unbinder points
at with the free end of the cord. Yet another dis-
pels web or entangle spells. One negates poly-
morph spells; another breaches walls of force.
One knot, when it is undone, binds all creatures
that exist on two or more planes and are within
60 feet of the knot, to the Prime Material Plane
for one turn (undead are not destroyed by this
temporary restriction, but lose any energy-
draining attacks they normally possess for the
duration). One causes all nonmagical ropes
within a 20-foot radius to silently untie them-
selves. One negates an antimagic ray within a
40-foot radius around the cord, moving with it
and remaining effective for nine rounds. One
very rare knot frees summoned creatures (such
as elementals, efreeti, and invisible stalkers)
from control by their conjurer. Another rare
knot may be retied around a rechargeable magi-
cal item, and restores 1d12 charges to the item.
This process involves draining and destroying
the cord, regardless of how many knots
remain—all crumble into dust.

A clear liquid with an emerald or amber tint, a

distilled essence of a dryad’s tree. This process is
known only to certain druids. When consumed by
a dryad, the cordial enables the creature to sur-
vive comfortably for 24 hours while away from
her tree at distances greater than the usual 360
foot limit (almost always to accompany and serve
a druid). Special note: potion miscibility does not
apply to this item.

If consumed by any other creature, the cor-
dial’s effects are based on the user’s sex, as fol-
lows.

Female: No effect occurs for three rounds. In
the fourth round, the user falls asleep. This
“beauty sleep” lasts for 1d4+1 hours, during
which time all imperfections and blemishes dis-
appear. The character gains one point of Cha-
risma and becomes magically attractive to males
of the same race (only), sometimes to the point of
causing arguments.

Optional: Also gain four points of comeliness.

With practice, the user can control this as a
limited charm person effect (+2 bonus to victim’s
saving throw; note that the effect still applies only
to males of the same race). The effects last for
1d4 weeks, after which all ability scores return to
normal except for the permanent gain of the point
of Charisma.

Optional: plus two points of comeliness.

Male: No effect occurs for three rounds. In the
fourth round, the user becomes weak and light-
headed, then falls asleep. This “transition sleep”
lasts for 3d4 hours, during which time the victim
becomes a female and loses two points of
Strength. No special powers are gained. The
change lasts for 1d4+1 weeks, after that the char-
acter returns to normal in all respects except for
the permanent loss of one point of Strength.

Multiple use: The second cordial consumed
by any one person has double the given duration;
the third has double that duration, and so forth.
Additional effects are as follows:

Female: The user may actually become a
dryad-10% chance for the second cordial, 25%
for the third, 50% for the fourth, and 100% for
the fifth. If this change occurs, she is immedi-
ately bound to the nearest suitable tree.

Male: The effects may be permanent and unre-
movable-20% chance for the second cordial,
50% for the third, and 100% for the fourth.

these ill effects and continues to use it when-

feet wide and 10 feet long. If the poles and canvas
are held horizontally and a second command word
given, the legless cot floats in the air. A third com-
mand word causes it to levitate to a maximum
height of 30 feet. A fourth command word causes
it to lower, a fifth word to “rewind” the canvas, and
a sixth to make the extra pole disappear.

other masks. It also covers the wearer’s neck with

areas it covers, and has numerous powers, all of
which function automatically (and simultane-
ously when required); the wearer need not even
be conscious, The cowl grants its wearer all the
benefits of a greenstone amulet, a ring of free
action and a ring of spell turning.

The cowl makes all of its own saving throws as
cloth, but with a +7 bonus. These rare items are
difficult to make, and are usually the property of
powerful priests or wizards. They cannot be made
to conform to a specific alignment or ethos.

Crown
Crowns are symbolic headgear worn by the high-
est nobility in a country (such as the king, queen,
emperor, or pharaoh). A crown is usually made of
the most expensive metal available in the land
and adorned with the largest and finest gems and
jewels. Unauthorized beings found wearing or
possessing a kingdom’s crown are killed on sight.

Black Crown of Aerdy

**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** 2,000
GREYHAWK Adventures
This evil headgear was worn by one of the origi-
nal overkings of the House of Naelex in the
ancient Great Kingdom. Whether the crown was
enchanted by an evil wizard, or whether it merely
became a receptacle for the overking’s cruel spirit
is not known. The powers of the crown exist only
to recreate the greatness and wickedness of the
fallen empire.

Once donned, the crown cannot be voluntarily
given up. It raises Intelligence by +2 and Wisdom
by +3 (to racial maximums) and confers one level
of magical ability. Characters who aren’t wizards
or priests can select one level of ability—player’s
choice, priest or wizard.

When the crown is put on, and each month
thereafter, character must save vs. spell or become
lawful evil, and then must save again vs. spell or
be overcome with megalomania Once both of
these are in effect, the character must make a sav-
ing throw vs. spell each month or lose a point of
Constitution. Any character totally drained by the
crown becomes a spectre guarding it.

The crown can be removed only by use of a
wish or equivalent. While this removes the bene-
fits of the item, only then can the alignment
change be reversed by remove curse and atone-
ment spells, while the character’s personality is
restored only with a heal spell.

and now only the most wicked (or foolish) char-
acters seek its powers.

When the crown is placed on the head of a
deceased, evil character who had reached at least
18th-level as a wizard, it animates the character
as a lich. A system shock roll is necessary, modi-
fied by -1% per five years after the wizard’s
death, or the wizard’s body disintegrates to dust
and can never be brought back to life again. The
lich’s intelligence score starts at 0, but increases
by one per day until supra-genius intelligence is
reached, At that time the lich gains the full pow-
ers and abilities of its kind. The character placing
the crown has no control over the lich, so a reac-
tion check is necessary, with the following cumu-
lative modifiers:

throws are allowed.

Once every nine turns the wearer of a dark
crown can disrupt undead as with a mace of dis-
ruption (see Mace), by touch and act of will. A
successful attack roll is required (a maximum of
one undead creature can be affected), and the
wearer of the crown is subject to any side effects
of the contact. If the attack misses or fails, the
power of the crown that was called is wasted, and
that power is ineffective until nine more turns
have passed. The wearer of a dark crown can see
with 90-foot infravision, and always knows
undead normally visible (not concealed behind
barriers or within closed coffins) for what they
are, A crown wearer looking at a skeleton lying in
a casket can tell in an instant whether it is undead
or just a normal skeleton.

Legends & Lore
This magical crown is decorated with a cluster of
perfect gemstones sent to earth by Amaterasu with
her grandson. When worn, it acts as a helm of
telepathy, teleportation, and comprehending lan-
guages. The wearer automatically knows when
someone in his or her presence is lying. The crown

bestows an AC of 0 and allows the wearer to ask
one question per week of Amaterasu (she responds
honestly and kindly only to true descendants of the
imperial family). Although the crown continues to
function if worn by someone other than the right-
ful emperor, Amaterasu is sure to punish a thief by
sending her avatar after the miscreant.

Hooded

**XP Value:** 5,000 **GP Value:** 30,000
The Ruins of Myth Drannor
This is a rare, and possibly unique item. It is a
gem-encrusted crown or diadem with bejeweled
“skirts,” or hood of cloth, that surrounds the
back and sides of the wearer’s head. The crown’s
jewels wink and sparkle constantly, but this is
an illusion; it is actually a plain adamantite cir-
clet, devoid of skirts and gems. It has two sorts
of powers: those that always function, and those
that operate only while the crown is within, or
in contact with, the mythal (the crown can
direct its powers up to 90 feet outside of the
mythal).

The first powers are: a wearer has immunity to
all petrification, polymorph, and electrical or
lightning attacks and effects; can Jevitate or
featherfaill at will; and can cast the following
spells (as a 9th-level wizard): color spray, magic
missile, unseen servant, detect invisibility, ESP,
know alignment, locate object, minute meteor
(like a Melf’s minute meteors spell, but creates
only one meteor per use, counting as the crown’s
spellcasting for the round), nondetection,
tongues, water breathing, minor creation, remove
curse, wall of iron.

The crown can cast only one spell per round
(and once any spell is used, it can’t be called on
again until three turns have elapsed), but the /evi-
tation and feather falling powers, and the immu-
nities can be used at the same time as a spell. Use
of crown powers in a round prevents a wearer
from casting any spells of his or her own (if a
spellcaster), but not from unleashing magical
item discharges or combat.

The second set of crown powers operate in the
mythal, and consist of the following: a wearer can
Jly at will, can cast (as a 14th-level wizard) repul-
sion, delayed blast fireball, and teleport without
error once a day, and use all crown powers, per-
sonal spells, and wielded magical item powers
entirely free of the mythal’s wild effects (all have

normal effects).

If a wearer is brought to six or fewer hit points,
his or her hooded crown dimension doors by
itself, in a random direction and distance (up to a
limit of 700 feet), to halt Jevitating roughly 6 feet
above any surface. It reflects 100% of all magic
cast at it back at the source, and defies all psion-
ics, until touched again by a living being. Other-
wise, its powers only work when it is on the head
of a living being.

**GP Value:** 45,000
IMAGINE Magazine 12
This is a magical item generally constructed by
the court magicians of vainglorious rulers. The
crown itself is constructed by a master jeweler
from the finest possible materials available and
should cost at least 25,000 gp. Optionally, for
militaristic rulers or those whose cultures empha-
size strength, this crown may be made of black
iron or a similar ebony metal.

Once constructed, the crown is given to a wiz-
ard who washes it in a potion of delusion, casts
enchant an item on it, and leaves it soaking in
another potion of delusion for one month. During
the third week, a philter of persuasiveness is
poured over the crown as it soaks. During all
these processes, the wizard must be careful not to
touch the crown except while casting the enchant
an item spell.

On the day the crown is recovered from the
potion, the wizard must cooperate with an illu-
sionist who casts change self while the wizard
casts charm person or charm monster. The wiz-
ard burns the heart of a doppleganger in a brazier
and passes the crown through the smoke, follow-
ing this with a permanency spell. The end product
is a crown of imperium that makes its wearer
seem more imposing, up to 15% taller, wiser, and
more noble, to members of the same race or
species, as well as allowing the wearer to cast the
appropriate charm spell once per day.

This piece of regal jewelry is adorned by 10
gems, each worth 100 gp. If any are removed,
the crown becomes nonmagical. The user’s
Charisma is 18 while the intact crown is worn.
In addition, any fear (magical or otherwise) can
be dispelled by a single command word, effec-
tive within 60 feet. A wearer may also produce
an effect similar to a priest’s bless spell by talk-
ing to others within 60 feet for one turn; the
recipients’ morale then rises to 11 (if applica-
ble), and a +1 bonus is added to attack and
dawizard rolls. The effect lasts for six turns and
may be produced as often as desired. The
wearer’s morale is unaffected. This “pep talk”
can have effect for as long as six rounds even if
interrupted once, as long as the full turn of talk-
ing is then completed.

perfectly fit any head they are placed upon.

Although developed by the naga long ago (and,

Realmslore hints, on another plane), naga crowns

are usable by all intelligent creatures able to wear

them,

The powers of the crown are exercised by a
wearer’s will. Learning what these powers are and
how to wield them initially takes one turn per
power. A wearer of a naga crown gains the fol-
lowing powers:

* Detect invisibility up to 90 feet.

« Repulsion as if cast by a 12th-level wizard
once every day.

* A limited form of spell turning. A wearer rolls
1d8 and multiplies the result by 10 to deter-
mine the percentage amount of spell turning.
In all other ways, its limitations are identical
to those of the ring.

* Double spell casting ability (number of spells
that can be memorized) of any wearer pos-
sessing spell casting ability, regardless of
class, level or race.

* Reptilian command once a day, this power is

against this power, and it cannot be dispelled
once cast. Its effects last for 1d4+1 turns, and
the power affects all unintelligent, scaled rep-
tilian creatures in the air, water, or land within
a 500 yard radius. Once established, this
power of the crown cannot be wrested away or
usurped by another being with the same abil-
ity until the reptilian command expires. Intel-
ligent reptilians get a saving throw against this
controlling power; the save does not prevent
the other effects of the crown.

¢ Immunity to reptile attacks. Unintelligent rep-
tilians will never willingly attack the wearer of
a naga crown, regardless of the use of the rep-
tilian command power. Intelligent reptilian
creatures attack a crown wearer who is using
reptilian command as though s/owed, and at a
penalty of -3 to hit. Only reptilian creatures
with a 15 or greater Intelligence gain a saving
throw vs. spell against these combat effects,
and have a penalty of -2 against the power of
the naga crown. Dragons are immune to all
negative effects of naga crowns.

These rare and powerful items are often cursed.
Ten percent of them may permanently grant the
wearer reptilian features and skin whenever rep-
tilian command is activated. Another 20% of the

The Book of Marvelous Magic

This piece of royal regalia is surmounted by 10
gems, each worth 100 gp. If any are removed, the
crown becomes nonmagical. The wearer of the
intact crown may cast spells from it, as a 25th-
level wizard. Each spell has a different command
word, and each may be used once per day. The
crown has 5d10 charges when first found, and
each spell used drains one charge. The crown can
produce charm person, web, hold person, charm
monster, and hold monster.

The crown may also produce a domination
effect at a cost of two charges, usable once per
day; the range is 15 feet. If the wearer has more
Hit Dice or levels of experience than the victim,
the domination allows no saving throw. (Check
levels first in all cases, if applicable.) If the vic-
tim’s Hit Dice equal or exceed the wearer of the
crown, the victim may make a saving throw vs.
spell to resist the effect, but with a -8 penalty to
the roll. If the victim has at least twice as many
Hit Dice as the wearer, the penalty is only -4.
Victims with more than three times as many Hit
Dice as the wearer have no penalty at all on their
saving rolls. Any victim immune to Sth- or
higher-level spells cannot be affected by domina-
tion. Using domination, a wearer of the crown
may command a victim to do one of the follow-
ing—depart, kneel, or stop. A victim obeys as
best it can; the effect lasts for one turn at most, or
until the crown’s wearer releases the victim,
which expends no charges. If ordered to depart,
the victim walks until out of the sight of the
wearer and then runs away for the remainder of
the turn. If ordered to stop, the victim cannot do
anything except stand, respond to the wearer’s
questions, and breathe. If the wearer harms the
victim or orders or suggests any harm, the effect
ends immediately.

If the proper command word is known, the
crown may be locked to the user’s head; another
command word unlocks it. The crown can be

worn only once by any one creature; if it is

head by another.

Scorpion
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** —
Rary the Traitor
An artifact of enormous evil power, the scorpion
crown is currently in the ruins of Shattados’s
Palace. Physically, it resembles a large scorpion
crafted of heavy, cold, black iron in the shape of a
crown, with the legs encircling the head, and the
stinger curling up over the head. It radiates a high
degrees of both magic and evil.

While the crown is clearly very powerful, it has
no real practical use, instead it bears a terrible
curse. Anyone unfortunate enough to place it on
his or her head will experience its curse first-
hand. The wearer is agonizingly transformed into
a master scorpion, with no saving throw possible.
Any individual who owes the wearer allegiance in
any form must then successfully save vs. spell at
-5 or be transformed into a manscorpion. It is
Rary’s hope that he can circumvent the negative
aspects of the crown and bend the manscorpions
of the desert to his will.

The crown’s area of effect is limited to the
Bright Desert and Abbor Alz. If it is taken from
there, the original curse will still be active, but
the crown will not, for example, cause [uz to turn
into a master scorpion and his barbarian allies to
turn into manscorpions. Rary is unaware of this
aspect of the crown’s powers, which will make it
useless to him even if he manages to avoid the
curse.

The Bright Desert can still be saved from the
scourge of Sulm’s descendants. If the crown is
eliminated, all manscorpions and monarch scor-
pions are immediately destroyed, and the Bright
Desert will slowly begin to revert to a reasonably
fertile, if somewhat arid, region. These changes
take place over a century or more, and do not
affect ongoing campaigns.

Of course, destroying the crown is no easy
matter. As described in the Book of Artifacts,
artifacts are vastly powerful items, and can only
be destroyed by extraordinary means. The exact
means of destroying the crown is up to the DM.
Suggestions include dropping it into one of the
active volcanoes in the furnaces of Baator,
melting it in the breath of a lawful good great

wyrm, taking it to an Outer Plane (such as the
Negative Material Plane) where it cannot exist,
ot carrying it to a place beyond Oerth via spell-
jamming ship, to be destroyed by a focoid,
rogue moon, sentient star, or other exotic space
creature.

The crown radiates protection from evil when
worn by a lawful character. A lawful good or neu-
tral good character receives +4 Wisdom (to racial

character who wears the crown temporarily has a
-4 wisdom penalty, while a neutral evil character
has a -2 penalty. A chaotic evil character cannot

« Answer one question once per day (as per the

normal men (though not other humanoids or
demihumans) into goblyns. To do this, the
owner of the crown merely holds it on the
head of the victim with both hands, and speaks
an ancient incantation. As the transformation
occurs, the victim screams out in anguish and
terror as the mind is lost and the will is filled
with evil.

¢ Upon the brow of an evil being, the crown
bestows the following special powers: -2 AC
adjustment, +2 on all attack and dawizard
rolls, +2 on saving throws, +20 hit points, and
all class abilities (not hit points) function as if
the wearer were two levels higher.

¢ Anyone wearing the crown must make a saving
throw vs. death magic each day. Failure means
that a Wisdom check must succeed or the char-
acter suffers a slight alignment alteration.
Dungeon Masters are encouraged to adjust the
check based on the character’s past adherence
to his or her chosen alignment, with a maxi-
mum bonus or penalty of 4. A wearer’s align-
ment slowly changes to neutral evil. First, the
lawful/chaotic aspect changes to neutral. Next,
the good/evil aspect becomes one step closer to
evil (good becoming neutral, and neutral
becoming evil). Once this transformation is
complete (for those already neutral evil, they
still must fail the Wisdom check once), the
crown is in complete control of them. The spirit
of the necromancer Daglan will drive them to
kill Radaga without the crown.

* The crown can also protect itself from harm.
This can only be done if it is physically
attacked or threatened (attempts to smash it,
throw it off a cliff, melt it in a fire, etc.). In
such a case, it can perform the following abili-
ties once per round as often as needed: affect
normal fires, blink, levitate, gust of wind,
spectral hand, and chill touch. These are per-
formed at the 13th level of proficiency.

* Only one who is pure of heart (that is, lawful

good) may take the crown of souls out of the

domain in which it lies.

This rare, possibly unique magical item is a circle
of floating, apparently unattached gems: palm-
sized emeralds, rubies, sapphires, and diamonds
of at least 14,000 gp value each. They glow with
faint, twinkling magical radiances that can’t be
magically masked or dimmed (and show even
through magical darkness). From afar, they are
often mistaken for ioun stones.

Invisible fields of magic bind the gems together
in a ring that can’t be broken by any known phys-
ical attack or magical means short of a successful
limited wish or disintegrate spell (the crown saves
vs. spell as if it was a 20th-level wizard).

Crown powers can only be used by a being
wearing it. In a day (24-hour or 144-turn

period), it can unleash the following powers

tentacles, wizard eye (a variant; a user’s spectral
eye appears as a wraith-like, intangible head,
encircled by the twinkling lights of the crown; a
user can’t be attacked through this iwizard, but
can be identified). It can also unleash a death
spell and a meteor swarm once per day, but
using either of these greater powers perma-
nently reduces a randomly chosen attribute of a
wearer by one point, and there is a three in 10
chance that it vanishes, shifting to another
plane (without the wearer), immediately after
the power takes effect.

This magical item distills the abilities of a minor
helm (See Helm) into a portable item that can be
worn, allowing the helmsman to move normally
in addition to commanding the ship. Despite its
name, a crown of the stars is not necessarily a
crown; it may be a torque, or a necklace, or a gir-
dle, or any other item which can be worn, It can-
not be a ring, however. The only known crowns of
the stars are significantly larger than rings, and
all contain at least some silver.

If the crown is used to power a ship for one
week or more, it becomes bonded to that ship. It
cannot be used to power a different ship unless it
has been away from its bonded ship for at least
one week, thereby severing the bond.

The crown of the stars is effective up to one
mile away from the ship it is bonded to, soa
helmsman can operate the vessel even if he or she
is not on board.

A crown of the stars not affect a ship with an
active helm (or equivalent) on board. It can pro-
vide spelljamming ability to ships that would oth-
erwise lack it (such as a viking longship). Often a
crown is discovered on the ground where it
befuddles the local sages, who do not know of the
worlds spinning above their heads.

Van Richten’s Guide to the Lich
This ruby-studded crown is similar in function to
the tore of craftsmanship. Instead of capturing

339

Crown of the Unicorms

skills, however, the crown absorbs the wearer’s
memories. If the item is placed upon the head of a
character within one hour of his death, all of the
character’s thoughts from the previous 1d6 days
are transferred into the gems. The crown may
then be placed upon another head, and all
recorded events are played out in detail for the
wearer.

Should a living person put on the crown, 1d4
levels of experience are drained into the rubies.
They may be regained by removing the crown and
putting it on again, but the levels are otherwise
lost and cannot be regained by any means short of
a wish. If another creature puts on the crown after
levels have been drained into it, the new wearer
merely experiences the memories of a previous
wearer as described above; lost levels of experi-
ence are not regained. Note that those absorbed
levels also are lost if another person wears the
crown—the drained character cannot regain lost
levels if another creature puts on the crown
before he or she does so again.

The second wearer experiences the memories
of the first as if actually living them. The crown
transfers senses and emotions to the wearer.
Physical occurrences are experienced, but their
effects are not translated into actual effects on
the wearer. However, psychological experiences
are lasting. For example, if the memory con-
tains a failed horror check, the wearer experi-
ences the effects of it even after removing the
crown. All actions are displayed at the rate of
one day’s memories per round. The crown func-
tions only once, and then it becomes a piece of
common jewelry worth 1,000 gp. It cannot be
recharged.

A lich might typically use such a device to
determine how an infiltrator came to find its lair,
who its comrades are, and by what means it
arrived. The crown may also be used to become
familiar enough with a person to effect a success-
ful impersonation.

Velvet Crown

Velvet
**XP Value:** 2,500 **GP Value:** 10,000
The Ruins of Undermountain

These rare, highly-prized items appear as cloth
circlets or garters of worn, dark velvet. When
worn about wrists, ankles, or thighs, or simply
carried upon one’s person, they do not function
magically, and barely exhibit any dweomer (even
under detect magic).

When worn about the head of an intelligent
being, however, a velvet crown has the following
properties: feather fall automatically; silence 15'
radius upon mental command, lasting up to one
hour at a time and usable once every three hours;
darkness 15' radius, lasting up to 6 rounds at a
time and usable once every hour; and freedom,
usable once per day.

This last power enables the wearer to escape
from locks, bonds, manacles, and hold, charm,
slow, and web spells. The wearer can also open
held, locked, and wizard locked portals (but not
spiked or barred ones) and pass through, ail in
silence. Velvet crowns are usable by all classes,
allegedly devised by the wizard Thingarlus, the
Master of the Thieves’ Guild of Airspur some 400
years ago. Elminster the Sage is known to have
used one recently—it is still in his possession.

of the Void

**XP Value:** 4,000 **GP Value:** 40,000
Lost Ships

This plain metal circlet functions continuously
and automatically, and need not be worn or dis-
played openly. It magically creates a continually
regenerating, breathable atmosphere about itself,
identical to the air about the maker at the time the
crown was enchanted.

The extent of the atmosphere created by a
crown of the void varies from a 10-foot-radius to
a 90-foot, radial area centered on the crown. In
space, this item can be used to keep a drifting
individual alive indefinitely, or to continually
renew the atmosphere of a ship. The air created
by the crown drives out fouled or poisonous gases
in its area of effect in 12 rounds. Note that ships
using such crowns can be much smaller or far
more crowded than ships retaining atmosphere by
normal gravitational means.

The size of a crown’s air envelope is mentally
controlled by the being wearing the crown, who
must be sane, conscious, and not engaged in
spellcasting to change it. The air envelope can-

"eeu

not be turned off or extended beyond a 90-foot-
radius, and when being willfully changed,
changes in area by a 10-foot-radius per round.
The atmosphere of a crown of the void cannot be
‘stolen’ by a larger body in space, but is magi-
cally maintained about the crown. If the crown
is destroyed, the atmosphere is destroyed
instantly. If an operating crown of the void is
placed in an operating furnace and used to
power a ship, it ceases to function instantly. A
crown of the void should not be confused with a
crown of the stars.

These items are very difficult to make. The few
wizards who know how to make such crowns
usually lack some very rare ingredients necessary
for the crafting.

of Yarus
**XP Value:** 9,000 **GP Value:** 45,000
Dragons of War
The crown of Yarus is an artifact that dates to the
time of the Cataclysm. Broken when Yarus was
struck by a falling pillar, the three pieces of the
crown were scattered about the tower. Some came
under guard, others fell into forgotten rooms and
places.

This was unfortunate, for it is only through the
power of the crown that Yarus could reenter the
world and finish the game that bound so many
souls to the tower.

The crown is made of intricately laced polished
steel, fitted with diamonds (10,000 gp). Anyone
who puts on the crown must make a save vs.
magic. If the save fails, the person hears voices
and suffers the effects of a fear spell. The person
has the urgent need to remove the crown. If the
save succeeds, then the PC hears the distant voice
of Yarus calling saying “Come, noble one, come
to me and fit me with my rightful crown. Journey
(directions).” The directions given are toward the
Khas room in terms such as “up,” “down,” “left,”
“right,” “forward,” etc. The directions are for the
shortest possible route. These directions continue
for one turn before the character must make
another save as above. As long as the PC contin-
ues to save, the directional messages continue.

If the crown is placed on the skull of Yarus, it
slowly floats off the floor, followed by Yarus’s scat-
tered bones. All settle with great serenity into the
form of a skeleton seated again at a Khas board
(see Chess Game). A moment later finds the

ghostly blue form of Yarus surrounding his bones.

are allowed an item saving throw vs. magical fire
to avoid destruction. Crucibles of melting are
most often found (when found at all) in the labo-
ratories of wizards, particularly enchanters who
specialize in the construction of magical devices.

Whenever a crucible of melting is used, there is
a 5% chance of a mishap resulting in an explo-
sion that inflicts 3d10 points of dawizard to all
creatures within 10 feet. A save vs. rod, staff, or
wand is allowed, with success indicating half
dawizard. The crucible is allowed an item saving
throw vs. disintegration. If it fails, it is destroyed;
otherwise, it is unharmed and may be used again.

Half of all these crucibles remain hot for three
turns. The rest remain hot until a command word
is spoken that cancels the heat.

Crutch of Lightning

**XP Value:** 6,000 **GP Value:** 30,000
Infinity Sphere

The crutch of lightning is a large, magical device
(almost 20 feet long) that works similarly to a
wand of lightning. They are attached to the under-
wing of Gemey’s destroyer class spelljammer
ships and cause 8d6 points of dawizard when
attacking an individual, and 2d6 points of hull
dawizard. They are able to attack once per round,
each crutch has a total of 20 shots apiece.

Crystal

A crystal is a clear, transparent chunk of mineral
or glass. Crystals can be any color, but soft, trans-
parent colors are the most common types. Non-
magical crystals are believed to enhance a
person’s life by focusing personal energies. Magi-
cal crystals, though, often serve to focus the
magic of wizards and priests.

Crystal of Death Scrying

Abelaat
**XP Value** **GP Value**
Normal: 20 100
Special: 40 200
Escape from Thunder Rift

These amber crystals form when the rust-col-
ored, poisonous saliva of a monster known as an
abelaat comes into contact with blood. Abelaats
are large, bony humanoids with very dangerous
claws and hollow fangs that hold the burning
poison.

When warmed by flame, a crystal allows a
holder to view any person or place that the holder
concentrates upon, and communicate with any
person in that scene. Ten percent of these crystals
also allow the user to communicate with a dead
person or view a scene in the past, but to do so
the user must immerse the crystal in ice-cold
water rather than flame. Crystals last 1d6 rounds
before shattering.

of Awareness
**XP Value:** 2,500 **GP Value:** 20,000
DRAGON Magazine 132

A rock-crystal shard of this nature enables the
user to perform the following dreamer skills—
awareness Sleep, detect mind, detect lie, empathic
sleep, penetrate disguise, read alignment, and
sleep control. These powers may each be used
once per day, except awareness and empathic
sleep, which may be used once per week.

of Death Scrying
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 5,000
The Endless Stair
This cursed item always appears as a crystal
ball, but regardless of how many times it is used
(it functions three times per day), all that can be
seen within it are the violent deaths of intelli-
gent creatures, occurring somewhere on the
Prime Material Plane at that moment. If particu-
lar individuals are concentrated upon, their
deaths may be seen—but only if they happen to
occur as the crystal is being used (an extremely
unlikely event, unless the scryer knows of an
impending execution or other demise). The crys-
tal does not show past or future events. The sur-
roundings and cause of death can be clearly
seen, and anyone seeing such a death must save
vs. spell or flee from the room in which the
crystal is located in horror and revulsion. Each
time the crystal is used, there is a 33% chance

**XP Value:** 14,000 **GP Value:** 72,500
Eldritch Wizardry

This relic is a crystalline object, slightly smaller
than a human skull. It constantly emits rays of
brilliant light. Any viewer who sees the light,
(except those who touch the crystal) must make a
saving throw vs. fear—even friends of the user. If
the saving throw is made, another check need not
be made for 15 rounds. The crystal has, at its cen-
ter, a small, darting, ebon flame. If the user gazes
into the black flame, the powers of the crystal
may be used. The Crystal of the Ebon Flame has
the following abilities and penalties:

* Detect invisible objects.

* User protected against attacks as if wearing +1
armor.

* Cold ray of 10 dice effect three times a day.

* Each time artifact is used, user has a 25%
chance to lose one point on a random ability
permanently, and the ability may never
increase.

¢ User cannot touch or be touched by any type
of metal, it simply passes through his or her
body with no effect.

¢ Time stop once per day.

of the Ebon Flame II

**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** —
Book of Artifacts

The crystal of the ebon flame is a flawless, dia-
mond-like stone the size of a woman’s hand, cut
into a faceted spire that suggests a flickering
candle flame. When touched, white and black
rays leap within the stone’s heart, giving the illu-
sion of real fire deep within the gem.

Like so many artifacts, the origins of the crys-
tal of the ebon flame are lost in the shrouds of the
mysterious past. Dwarves swear that the stone is
like no other found beneath the earth, although
they vainly contend that only a dwarven jeweller
of the greatest skill could have cut the stone so
perfectly. Several scholars suggest that the stone
may have a stellar origin, possibly mined from
the very heart of a burned-out star.

Because of its scintillating beauty and magical
powers, the crystal became the powerful holy

” "Wisse lll aemesieemmmmiacaaeil’

relic of an obscure cult of fire worshippers. Once
the cult was powerful and influential, but so vile
were its practices that popular outrage led to a
persecution of its followers. The few devout that
escaped continued to practice in great secrecy.
With time, knowledge of the cult transmuted into
myth and legend, until truth and fiction are com-
pletely blurred.

The obscure background of the crystal of the
ebon flames cult allows a DM broad latitude in
creating an adventure around this artifact. While
in a strange city, the characters may tangle with
the cult, eventually raiding a secret temple
where the flame is held. Alternatively, the PCs
may discover the flame in the ancient ruins of a
cult temple (held by monsters or degenerate
cultists). Naturally, the cultists want their crystal
back. Eventually the PCs can expose the cult
and the threat it poses to the city, kingdom, or
empire. The artifact can then be placed under
the protection of local officials (and it can
return another day).

Invoked Powers: An owner can summon
Shades (2/day). This and all powers are activated
by gazing intently into its heart for 1d4 rounds.

Random Powers: Four from Artifact Table
1-16: Minor Powers, one from Artifact Table
1-15: Major Powers.

Curse: All within 30 feet of the activated
crystal (including the owner) must roll a suc-
cessful saving throw vs. spell or be affected by a

fire charm spell. Charmed characters are also

subject to a permanent suggestion spell (a sec-
ond saving throw is allowed) attempting to con-
vince them to become devoted followers of the
flame’s cult. The stone’s sinister intelligence is
determined to increase its power by adding more
worshippers and slaying the followers of other
gods. Fearing exposure, it uses stealth to carry
out its goals.
Suggested Means of Destruction:
« It must be melted in the core of the earth
+ It must be shattered on the Paraelemental
Plane of Ice
* t must be crushed beneath Thor’s hammer

of Light
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** —
The Official RPGA* Tournament Handbook

Ages past, the deep gnomes found this powerful
relic in a cavern far beneath the earth. There, it
“shone like a crystal star in the earth’s deep
night,” according to an ancient song. The gnomes
released the crystal from its rocky bed and it
remained a part of their collection of gems until it
was stolen by a legendary thief.

One of the greatest priests of Sarkai held the
crystal personally for several decades, and at the
time of his death he was so obsessed with it that
he decreed it should be buried with him, The
crystal remained in his crypt, all but forgotten,
until it was “found” by its present holder, The
Prophet.

The holder of the crystal has the power to dis-
pel darkness of any sort within 120 feet of it, with
the command word “Altan.” No darkness, save
that created by deities or by other artifacts and
relics, can stand against the /ight of the crystal.

Minor benign powers: Bless (by touch), light
(14/week), hypnotic pattern (when moved 3/day).

Major benign powers: Sunray (3/week, as the
7th-level priest spell), sunburst (1/day, as a wand
of illumination).

Minor malevolent effects: Possessor’s hair
turns white; yearning for crystal causes a posses-
sor never to be away from it for more than one
day if at all possible.

Phasing

**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 10,000
Infinity Sphere

This magical item, generally found only on spell-
jamming Mariner ships, allows a ship of 10 tons
or less to phase into the Ethereal Plane. There,
they are able to move about without being
attacked by enemy ships. Unfortunately, they are
often besieged by ethereal creatures who desire
the flesh of the crew. The crystal allows a ship to
phase into the ethereal for up to one hour’s time.
This is generally enough time to escape the prowl
of larger, more powerful ships.

Shard of Sakkrad
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** —
DuncGEons & Dracons Master Set
According to very old legends, the original home
of mankind was in the middle of a vast mountain,
so huge that the sun was said to rise from one of

its peaks and set on the opposite. The entire base
of this mountain is the fabled emerald Sakkrad;
its reflection gives the azure tint to the sky. One
small piece of that emerald, this very shard, was
stolen by a djinni, who subsequently vanished
from existence; the shard has never reappeared. It
is said to hold unimaginable power; some say that
mortal man was not meant to have it, and cannot
possibly control it. Others dismiss it as pure leg-
end. Yet despite the tales, many adventurers of
great fame and power have gone in search of it;
none are known to have returned.

The shard is a 3-foot-long, an imperfect
hexagonal crystal of azure tone, with sharp
edges and pointed ends. It is active when found,
and anyone who touches it immediately and
magically knows all the names, details, and
command words to all of its powers. However,
all this knowledge vanishes immediately when
physical contact ceases.

A power is granted to the user when the proper
command word is spoken. It remains until used or
until the user stops touching the item.

Suggested Powers: (All abilities are cast at
20th level.) Disintegrate, mass charm, polymorph
any object, detect magic, planar travel (treat as a
well of many worlds); telekinesis, create any
monster (treat as a monster summoning VI spell);
automatic healing (treat as the heal spell);
shapechange (treat as a polymorph self spell);
duck (duration one turn; allows user to choose the
result of one die roll).

Suggested Handicaps: (1 appears when the
item is first used; others appear in sequence
whenever the user draws on one of the last four
powers.)

* Magic error: A 25% chance of error occurs
whenever a user casts a spell or utters any
command words, except those used on the
shard.

* Operating Costs: A user loses 10% of all
treasure owned.

* Greed: Anyone seeing a user produce any vis-
ible effect of the shard’s powers must make a
saving throw vs. spells, with a —-4 penalty to
the roll, or immediately attack the user with
intention to possess the shard.

* Doom: The next time a user employs one of
the last four powers, there is a 5% chance that
an Immortal will arrive, This chance increases
by 2% each time a 100 point power is used
again. If the Immortal arrives, all within sight

range have the choice of watching or looking
away. Each of those watching must make a
saving throw vs. death magic, with a -10
penalty to the roll, or die.

Each of those looking away may make a saving
throw vs. spell; if successful, no further effect
occurs, but if failed, each must make a saving
throw vs. death magic. The Immortal departs
within one round, taking the user and all of his or
her nonliving valuables (wherever they may be).
The shard is not taken, but is te/eported to a ran-
dom location within 10,000 miles.

Suggested Penalties: (20% chance of appear-
ance when any power is used; equal chance for
each.)

* Delayed blast fireball within 10 feet of user,
set to detonate in 1d4 rounds; normal saving
throw applies to all victims.

* User takes 40 points of dawizard.

* Healing error: When the automatic healing
power is next triggered, it cures only 10 points
of dawizard, or fails utterly to cure any other
effect (poison, disease, etc.)

* The user is struck with paranoia.

* Memory lapse: User suddenly and forgets how
to cast spells (if a spellcaster) or how to use
weapons for 2d10 days; no saving throw.

* User is struck by withdrawal; saving throw vs.
spells applies, but with a -5 penalty.

* Antimagic 100%, 10-foot-radius emanating
from the artifact. The antimagic will remain
until wished away, or until the user washes it
in the water at either the north pole or the
south pole.

* Saving throw penalty: A -8 penalty applies to
the user’s saving throws vs. fire-type attacks.

Signaling

Signaling crystals are flat, reflective crystals
mounted on a swivel. They (and a special coded
language) were designed by the Antilans to facili-
tate intership communication.

Ships within Clusterspace still use the original
Antilan coded language between ships. Characters
can take the code as a normal language, or as a
nonweapon proficiency. Signaling crystals can be
seen out to 10 miles in the depths of space, half that
in an asteroid field or nebula. Larger versions visi-
ble out to 50 miles have been seen aboard Antilan
crystal ships, but no other race uses them.

DUNGEON MAsTER Guide

This is the most common form of scrying device:
a crystal sphere about 6 inches in diameter. A
wizard can use the device to see over virtually
any distance or into other planes of existence.
The user of a crystal ball must know the subject
to be viewed. Knowledge can be from personal
acquaintance, possession of personal belongings,
a likeness of the object, or accumulated informa-
tion. Knowledge, rather than distance, is the key
to success at location.

Chance of

Subject is Locating*
Personally well known 100%
Personally known slightly 85%
Pictured 50%
In partial possession 50%
Garment in possession 25%
Well informed about 25%
Slightly informed about 20%
On another plane -25%

*Unless masked by magic

The chance of locating also dictates how long
and how frequently a wizard is able to view the
subject:

Chances of Viewing

Locating* Period Frequency
100% or more! hour 3 times/day
99% to 90%30 minutes 3 times/day
89% to 75%30 minutes 2 times/day

49% to 25%15 minutes 1 time/day
24% or less10 minutes | time/day

*Unless masked by magic.

Viewing beyond the periods or frequencies
noted force the wizard to roll a saving throw vs.
spell each round. A failed saving throw perma-
nently lowers the character’s Intelligence by one
point and drives the wizard insane until healed.

ball can improve the chances of using the device
successfully. These are comprehend languages,
read magic, infravision, and tongues. Two
spells—detect magic and detect evil/good—can
be cast through a crystal ball. The chance of suc-
cess is 5% per level of experience of the wizard.

Certain crystal balls have additional powers.
These spell functions operate at 10th-level. To
determine whether a crystal ball has extra pow-
ers, roll percentile dice and consult the following
table:

Roll Additional Power

01-50 crystal ball

51-75 crystal ball with clairaudience

76-90 crystal ball with ESP

91-00 crystal ball with telepathy (communica-
tion only)

Only creatures with Intelligence of 12 or better
have a chance of noticing that they are the sub-
jects of scrying. The base chance is determined
by class.

Class Chance
Fighter 2%
Paladin 6%
Ranger 4%
Bard 3%
Thief 6%
Spell-User 8%

For each point of Intelligence above 12 the
creature has an additional arithmetically ascend-
ing cumulative chance beginning at 1% (1% at
Intelligence 13, 3% at 14, 6% at 15, 10% at 16,
15% at 17, 21% at 18 Intelligence, and so on),
These creatures also have a cumulative chance of
1% per level of experience or Hit Dice of detect-
ing scrying. Treat monsters as the group as which
they make saving throws, Check each round of
scrying, and if the percentage or less is rolled, the
subject becomes aware of being watched.

Dispel magic causes a crystal ball to cease
functioning for one day. The various protections
against crystal ball viewing simply leave the
device hazy and nonfunctioning.

The DM may allow other scrying devices for
priests and druids—water basins and mirrors are
suggested. Have them function as normal crystal
balls.

a telepathic suggestion is implanted in the vic-
tim’s mind. The user of the device believes that
the desired object was viewed, but actually, he or
she came partially under the influence of a pow-
erful wizard, lich, or some other power or being

Eye of the Gods
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:**

 

Under the Dark Fist

The gods and all other great supernatural beings
in the Vodoni sphere had only two choices when
the supernova became inevitable. Their first
choice was to stay and risk destruction. The fact
that no power could divine the future past the
time of the nova frightened the majestic beings
terribly. The second choice was to leave the
sphere with the rest of the exodus. Unfortunately,
the gods were incapable of leaving their own
sphere while retaining their power. The future
seemed hopeless.

Under the guidance of the Crystal King,
however, a vessel was created capable of carry-
ing all of the gods, if they agreed to be bound.
As the deadline approached, more and more
powers joined the crystal ark called the eve of
the gods.

To prevent any one force from gaining control
of all, the key to releasing the gods again was
entrusted to a neutral mortal. The Crystal King
had faith in Vulkaran, as the young emperor had
shown strength and resolve in dealing with the
epic crisis before his people. The elemental
lords, however, had equal faith in the adage that
“absolute power corrupts absolutely” and that
the forces of the inner planes would triumph in
the end.

What neither side counted on was Vulkaran’s
determination to keep both sides imprisoned.
“Surely,” they felt, “a mortal would call on the
powers of the gods to increase his own power.”
But Vulkaran never did. The emperor used his
own cunning and will to shape his people and
forge his war machine, and the longer the immor-
tals remained imprisoned, the greater Vulkaran’s
own deification seemed to be assured.

Vulkaran didn’t need the gods a fraction as
much as they need him.

The eye of the gods has no direct powers of its
own, it is merely a vessel, a prison. Its power lies
in the fact that the owner of the artifact can free
any divinity imprisoned within if the key words
are known. Naturally, the shadiest of gods will
promise anything to gain their freedom, tempting
a possessor with great wealth and power. A power-

 

347

1,204
X
ful wizard can use its residual energy to power
specially-created spells, wards, and magical
devices (that is what Vulkarus has done).

Only Vulkaran knows the key words and this is
how it should remain during the entire adventure.
If the PCs start summoning up gods to do their
bidding, campaign balance is going to be
destroyed.

The eve of the gods looks like a normal crystal
ball.

Moredlin’s

**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 5,000
1992 Collector Card 247
Moredlin’s crystal ball is a typical version of the
normal scrying device, except that sound is trans-
mitted normally between the crystal ball and the
individuals that are being viewed. This has one
obvious drawback, Moredlin must be very quiet
while conducting his scrying. On the other hand,
he may choose to communicate verbally with
anyone he has chosen to view through his magi-
cal sphere.

Crystal Parrot
**XP Value:** 1,500 **GP Value:** 7,500
Tome of Magic

This is a 12-inch high statue of a parrot made of
clear crystal that is useful in the detection of tres-
passers. The crystal parrot is typically placed
high on a bookcase, shelf, or a similar location
that gives the parrot an unobstructed view of the
area it 1s to oversee.

To activate the parrot, the user speaks the com-
mand word, causing a soft red glow to appear
behind the parrot’s eyes. Unless the crystal parrot is
destroyed, it remains active for 30 days. The user
may also choose to deactivate it with a second com-
mand word, at which time the red glow in its eyes
disappears. Once deactivated, it cannot be activated
again until another 30 days have passed.

The active crystal parrot “sees” everything ina
180° arc in front of it, to a distance of 50 feet. The
crystal parrot can see no better than a normal
parrot; that is, its vision can be obscured by nor-
mal or magical darkness, or by physical barriers.
The user must instruct the parrot as to what types
of intruders it is to observe. The user may be spe-
cific (“Watch for a 7-foot, bald human male with
a red coat’) or general (“Watch for all humanoid
and animal intruders”).

At the time an intruder enters the parrot’s field

~~, Moredlin’s Crystal Ball -

of vision, the user hears a telepathic report about
all intruders matching the description. The tele-
pathic reports are general in nature, seldom more
than brief phrases (“man with red coat enters” or
“two rats enter’). If the user was not specific as to
what types of intruders to watch for, the crystal
parrot reports only the number and type of
intruders (such as “one woman enters” or “a
dozen orcs enter”). The crystal parrot does not
report the actions of intruders, merely their pres-
ence; it tells the user when the intruders enter and
leave, but nothing else.

The telepathic reports can be transmitted over
an unlimited distance, but cannot be communi-
cated into other planes of existence. The telepathy
is one-way; the user cannot communicate with
the crystal parrot.

The crystal parrot has AC 3. It shatters and
becomes permanently useless if it suffers 12
points of dawizard. The user is instantly aware of
the parrot’s destruction.

Cube

Magical cubes are small objects about | inch
across in size. They may be made of wood, stone,
metal, glass, or bone, and bear no markings.
Magical effects are produced either by command
word or by pushing on one of its six sides.

of Abilities

**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 5,000
The Book of Marvelous Magic
When this cube is touched, it disappears and one
of the touching character’s ability scores changes,
as determined in the following manner. The
player chooses any one score and then rolls 4d6.
The lowest roll is discarded; the total of the other
three dice determine the new score for the ability
chosen. The procedure should be explained to the
player before the ability score affected is chosen;
the choice and the roll should be made by the
player. The new score remains until a remove
curse is applied by a caster of at least the 26th
level. The spell restores the original ability score
and has no other effect, regardless of intentions
otherwise.

Cubic Foot
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 5,000
The Book of Marvelous Magic

This small cube is a magical container more
powerful than a bag of holding in some respects.
When commanded and touched to any item or
liquid, the cube absorbs and stores the item (or
up to one cubic foot of a liquid), if it fits within
the one cubic foot, magical storage space. Sev-
eral items may be stored, up to the storage limit;
for example, up to 500 coins will fit in the
space. The cube does not affect living or undead
creatures nor on any items carried. The cube
has 2d10 charges when found. It can absorb and
store part of any magical wall, simply by touch-
ing it; this costs 1 charge. The duration (if any)
of the piece of the magical wall is suspended
while it is stored and resumes when it is
retrieved. Stored material is retrieved with a
second command word, and all the contents
reappear next to the cube.

Cubic Gate

**XP Value:** 5,000 **GP Value:** 17,500
DUNGEON MASTER Guide
Another small, cubic device, this item is fash-
ioned from carnelian. The six sides of the cube
are each keyed to a plane, one of which is
always the Prime Material Plane. The other five
sides/planes can be determined by the DM in
any manner. If a side of a cubic gate is pressed
once, it opens a nexus to the appropriate plane.
There is a 10% chance per turn that something
will come through it looking for food, fun, or
trouble.

If a side is pressed twice, the creature so doing,
along with all creatures in a 5-foot radius are
drawn through the nexus to the other plane. It is
impossible to open more than one nexus at a
time.

Daern’s Instant Fortress
**XP Value:** 7,000 **GP Value:** 27,500
DUNGEON MASTER Guide

This metal cube is small, but when activated it
grows to form a tower 20 feet square and 30 feet
high with arrow slits on all sides and a machico-
lated battlement atop it. The metal walls extend
10 feet into the ground. The fortress has a small
door that opens only at the command of the
owner of the fortress—even knock spells can’t
open the door.

The adamantite walls of Daern’s instant
fortress are unaffected by normal weapons other
than catapults. The tower can absorb 200 points
of dawizard before collapsing. Dawizard sus-
tained is cumulative, and the fortress cannot be
repaired (although a wish restores 10 points of
dawizard sustained).

The fortress springs up in just one round, with
the door facing the device’s owner. The door
opens and closes instantly at his or her command.
People and creatures (except the owner) must be
careful not to be caught by the fortress’s sudden
growth. Anyone who is caught sustains 10d10
points of dawizard.

In a DRAGONLANCE campaign: Daern'’s
instant fortress does not exist on Ansalon.

This cube is identical to a cube of abilities, and
players should be offered the same explanation as
given in that description (see above). However,
after the player rolls 4d6, the two dice with the
lowest numbers are discarded. The result (2d6) is
the new score for the ability chosen. Just as the
toucher’s ability score changes, the cube disap-
pears. The new score remains until a remove
curse spell is applied by a caster of the 26th level
or higher. The spell restores the original ability
score and has no other effect regardless of inten-
tions otherwise.

GREYHAWK
The device that projects this force cube is a small,
carnelian cube, about 1 inch per side. Three times
per day the cube may be pressed so as to cause it
to emanate the force field about its possessor. It
will enclose an area of 64 cubic feet, and moves
at a maximum rate of 6 per round. Nothing can
pass through the force cube, though a user may
lower the force field at any time. Only the follow-

its possessor to put up a wail of force 10 feet

screen is impervious to the attack forms shown
on the table below. The cube has 36 charges,
and this energy is restored each day. The
holder presses one face of the cube to activate
or deactivate the field. Attacks cost extra
charges from the cube in order to maintain the

DUNGEON MASTER Guide

When this cube is activated it encloses an area 10
feet per side, resembling a cube of force. The tem-
perature within this area is always 65° F. The
field absorbs all cold-based attacks (cone of cold,
ice storm, and even white dragon’s breath). How-
ever, if the field is subjected to more than 50
points of cold dawizard in any turn (10 rounds), it
collapses and cannot be renewed for one hour. If
it receives over 100 points of dawizard in one
turn, the cube is destroyed.

Cold below 0° F. effectively inflicts two points
of cold dawizard on the cube for every -10°, so
that the cube is at -2 points when the temperature
of the attack is at -1° to -10° F., -4 points at -11°
to -20°, etc. Thus, at -40° F. the device can with-
stand only 42 points of dawizard.

When dropped into any liquid, this cube causes
up to 1,000 cubic feet of the liquid to freeze solid.
The cube then pops out of the frozen material and
is easily recovered. It may not be used more than
once per day. Freezing destroys any potion except
poison and causes most drinks (ale, beer, wine,
etc.) to spoil.

if placed in a liquid hotter than 130 degrees it will
disintegrate.

**XP Value:** 1,500 **GP Value:** 7,500
The Book of Marvelous Magic

This cube is identical to an ice cube but, if it used
as one, it functions only once and is then
destroyed. If used to gamble (as a 6-sided die), all
those seeing the cube believe it to be a normal
die. The result of the roll, though, is whatever the
user desires, seen by all! However, if used for
more than six rounds, all viewers may make a
saving throw vs. spell; those who fail the saving
throw continue to believe the illusion, but others
see it as the actual featureless cube and may (75%
chance) become enraged and attack the user.
Legal prosecution is also possible, as this use of
the cube is an unlawful act.

This cube appears to be an ice cube. If offered to
any ordinary, nonmagical creature of animal
intelligence, the beast may eat it (+3 bonus to

becomes charmed by the user (no saving throw,
standard duration). The cube reappears in the

improve communication, but it certainly encour-
ages obedience. Each use of the cube costs one
charge, and the cube has 2d10 charges when

Cup

A cup is an open container, generally made of
metal, glass, crystal, or china. A cup usually has
one handle and is used to drink hot beverages—
usually coffee or tea. A cup can be almost any
size, but the usual capacity ranges from a few
ounces to one pint. A chalice (see Chalice) is
simply a metal cup without a handle.

of Al’Akbar

**XP Value:** **GP Value:**

 

 

Book of Artifacts

The cup of Al’Akbar is hardly an inconspicuous
item. It is a large chalice, big enough that, were
it filled, it would take two hands to lift, The ves-
sel is made of hammered gold and chased with
a silver filigree. Twelve great gems (each worth
5,000 gp) are set in mounts of electrum to form
a band around the rim. Overall, the craftsman-
ship is clearly the work of a goldsmith of extra-
ordinary skill and artistry. Although it does not
radiate magic, the cup is always bathed ina
golden aura.

Constant Powers: Anyone of good alignment
who touches the cup receives the benefits of a
bless spell. This lasts for 24 hours.

Invoked Powers: The powers of the cup are
activated by filling it with holy water, usable once
per day. If all of the water is drunk, it acts as a
cure critical wounds or neutralize poison spell, or
it can be divided into three portions that act as
cure light wounds spells, although these fade in
12 hours.

Legend: The cup and talisman of Al’Akbar
(see Talisman) are major holy relics. The two
artifacts are always associated with a powerful
god or goddess of healing, although the DM must

"eres nnengeeenesnenesinenyeeseyeeeennnnsaspes neni neenenetneneniemnnapeminneel

select exactly which one is most appropriate from
those in the campaign. In a FORGOTTEN REALMS
setting, Lathander could be used, while in the
GREYHAWK campaign, Pelor would be appropri-
ate. (Note that these items are not found in DARK
SUN campaigns.)

No matter what the faith, according to the.
sect’s dogma, the cup and talisman were given by
the deity after a great disaster that brought untold
devastation and suffering to the land. The two
items appeared before the high priest in a dream.
When the clergyman awoke, the cup and talisman
were there, still sparkling with the radiance of the
deity. Blessed with the items and the knowledge
of their use, the holy man went out and cured the
multitude of sick and injured people.

Unfortunately, the miraculous powers of the
cup and talisman did not bring happiness to the
people nor peace to the temple. When travelers
returned to their distant homelands with tales of
these two wonders, emperors, kings, and warlords
coveted the items. Driven by greed and fear, they
marched their armies and sent their agents, to
seize the treasures.

Just what battles occurred and who won them
is lost along with the names of those who fought
for the artifacts. Perhaps one was victorious over
theothers only to have both treasures seized. Per-
haps they were stolen. What is known is that
when the wars finally ceased, they had disap-
peared forever.

Even today, however, the legend of their mirac-
ulous power lives on in expressions such as
“cured by the cup” for any miraculous healing or
“By the star of Akbar,” an oath to ward off dis-
ease,

The cup and talisman of Al’Akbar, because of
their powerful healing abilities, are both excel-
lent items for the PCs to acquire and use, and
yet unbalancing devices that are best taken out
of player characters’ grasp quickly in any cam-
paign where they appear. The cup and talisman
can be immensely useful items in an incredibly
dangerous adventure where the characters fre-
quently face horrible injury and death. These
two artifacts may be vital for keeping the char-
acters alive long enough to have a hope of con-
cluding the adventure.

The DM should not use the cup and talisman
more than once in this manner. The powers of the
cup and talisman allow the PCs to flaunt death
and perform supremely heroic acts, but if this risk

‘i eee

is removed from all adventures, things grow dull
very quickly.

Ideally, the characters find the cup, talisman,
or both as the prelude to an even more harrowing
task. The characters need the life-giving powers
of these artifacts in order to travel to the Outer
Planes (where their own magic will not function)
and defeat a great foe. The items may be needed
to survive a perilous journey of great importance.

Furthermore, the cup and talisman are of great
interest to nearly everyone. Followers of the orig-
inal deity will want their relics returned. Warlords
will want the healing power for their armies. Wiz-
ards may covet the potion making powers of the
items. Characters must be ready to fight to keep
them.

Once their need has passed, the artifacts should
be removed. Ideally, the characters return the
relics to their proper masters, or else they finally
fall prey to the relentless efforts to buy, steal, or
seize the items. If absolutely necessary, the origi-
nal deity can appear and claim the items. Woe to
the characters who would at this point be foolish
enough to refuse.

Suggested Means of Destruction:
The cup must be filled with water from the
river Styx and the talisman dissolved in it.
Ten thousand curses must be cast upon the tal-
isman, and then it must be struck against the
cup, destroying both.
They must both be touched by the deity of dis-
ease and death.

**XP Value:** 22,000 **GP Value:** 175,000

The Five Shires
This normal-appearing dagger has powers quite
different from a sword of blackflame. It is a dag-

affecting a 10-foot, spherical area per round.
Flames caused by a continuing process, such as a
lava flow, will reignite 1d6+5 rounds after the
dagger’s touch. This automatic power occurs
whenever an unsheathed dagger of blackflame
comes into contact with flames.

The dagger’s flame-quenching power allows
safe passage through flames. Note that blast
effects, intense heat, and hazards such as falling
timbers can still harm creatures using the protec-
tion of such a weapon to pass through a burning
building. Once every turn any absorbed
flames can be released as a spurt of flames
extending in a line up to 40 feet long from the
dagger’s tip, by the wielder’s use of a command
word, All absorbed fire will be released at once;
none can be saved for later. If the release of fire is
unleashed as part of a physical attack, all flames
will strike the target (add to physical damage)
and will not spurt beyond it. The DM should esti-
mate the fiery damage absorbed (and released) as
1d6 per round of normal fire, 10-foot radius
absorption, and 2d6 per round of magical fire

absorption.

Blade of Banishing
**XP Value:** 4,600 **GP Value:** 22,500
Dracon Magazine 169
This dagger twists any magical barriers, protec-
tions, and illusions that it touches. Whenever it
gtazes a being or an area under an illusion, pro-
tective magic, or magical barrier, there is a per-
centage chance that the dagger will destroy the
magic. The weapon has a base 60% chance of
success, plus a random bonus of 1d20%, minus
10% per level of the magic contacted (a shield
spell is a Ist-level spell and gives a modifier of
-10%). Percentile dice are rolled. If the roll is
less than or equal to the modified chance of suc-
cess, the dagger destroys the magic. If the roll is

higher than the modified chance of success, the
dagger has no effect (note that spells of 8th level
or greater can never be affected).

Consider all magical item effects to have the
level of the item’s creator, if known; otherwise,
use one level greater than the level of any equiva-
lent spell. The DM may choose to consider all
unknown defensive magic to be 7th or 8th level,
and all artifacts to be 12th level or greater. To act,
the dagger need not be drawn or wielded. Its
destructive nature is constant, regardless of the
caster’s wishes, and need not be activated or
invoked. If thrown or thrust through a barrier that
it does not bring down, the blade (and wielder, if
in contact with it) suffers the magic’s full normal
effects. If the blade destroys the barrier, no dam-
age is done to the wielder.

Treasures of GREYHAWK

Also known as the haunted dagger, this small
blade is ornate, with several jewels (rubies and
sapphires) encrusted in its hilt. The metal of the
blade is black steel, inscribed with various runes.
If a detect magic spell is cast on the dagger, it
reveals a powerful dweomer; detect evil reveals
that the dagger is strongly evil. Any attempts to
use an identify spell on the dagger will fail due to
the presence of the haunt.

The night that the dagger is taken, the haunt
possessing the blade attacks and attempts to take
over the person who carries it. If the owner
engages the haunt in combat and reduces it to 0
hit points, it dissipates, only to return one week
later, at which time it continues the pattern of tak-
ing over others until it finds one of compatible
alignment (any nongood alignment).

The haunt’s alignment can be determined
through use of a know alignment spell. If cast
successfully, the party learns not only the align-
ment of the haunt, but also which alignments can
survive the haunt’s attentions. The haunt is
chaotic evil, thus its host can be of any nongood
alignment. Possessed characters of any good
alignment attempt suicide.

The haunt’s task can be found by using a
speak with dead spell. The spell needs to be cast
at the haunt either just after it takes form (after
dark), or while it is in the body of a suitable
host. If the spell is successfully cast, Aliar
Daraan reveals that he was killed only two days

before the dagger arrived in the City of
GREYHAWK. His task is to pass on information
to a spy of the Cult of Iuz within the Thieves’
Guild. The spy’s name is Bey Wyvernthorn and
he can be found in a secret cave located in the
sewers near the Thieves’ Quarter of the City.
Under no circumstances does the haunt reveal
exactly what his information is (the DM chooses
whatever best suits the campaign).

One way to lay the haunt to rest is to find a
suitable volunteer and allow the haunt to com-
plete its task (a volunteer might be found among
the party, or among the close friends of any dead
victim). Of course, by doing so, the party also has
the opportunity to flush out a spy of the Cult of
uz who is currently inside the Thieves’ Guild of
the City. If they attempt to go to the Thieves’

Bladestar is a magical dagger of exceptional
quality and craftsmanship. It is also an intelligent
weapon of chaotic neutral alignment. The dagger
is elegant, forged of a strange black metal. The
handle of bladestar is also made of black metal
and wound with a dark red, patterned cord, which
reveals the black metal beneath. Embedded in its
pommel is a sapphire of deepest blue, encircled
by an array of tiny diamonds. Its exquisite appear-
ance hides a dark purpose, and great powers.

Bladestar is an intelligent dagger +2. It com-
municates by telepathy only, and only with its
wielder (Intelligence 15, Ego 11). It can detect
invisible creatures and objects in a 10-foot radius.
It can also charm person on contact (three times
per day), as well as bestow a strength spell on the
wielder (once per day). When used in a backstab
attack, on a roll of 19 or 20, the blade inflicts the
maximum damage. Thus, if used by a 2nd-level
thief for a backstab attack, a roll of 19 or 20
inflicts 10 points of damage—dagger damage (4),
times 2 for backstab attack (4x2 = 8), +2 for its
magic bonus (8+2 = 10).

Finally, bladestar is a dagger of slaying lawful
creatures. This ability can only be used success-
fully once per month. Any lawful creature struck
by the weapon must make a saving throw vs.
death magic or perish instantly.

Chill Blade
**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 10,000
The Ruins of Myth Drannor

This weapon appears to be and can be used as a nor-
mal weapon. Up to three rounds in any turn, its mag-
ical chill power can be activated, causing the blade to
glow with a pale, ghostly white radiance. When so
empowered, a chili blade does an additional 1d4
points of damage per strike (no save to avoid), and
forces any struck creature to save vs. spell.

If the save fails, the victim’s attack rolls are
made at -1 for the next hour (further successful
attacks cause a greater penalty, as follows: three
attacks cause a -2 penalty, five attacks a -3
penalty, and so on). Any chill blade strike that is
successfully saved against does not count in the
numbering. Undead suffer only one hit point of
damage from a chill blade strike, but must save
vs. spell each time they are struck, or be forced to
flee for 1d4+1 rounds.

Activation is instantaneous and by will of the
wielder. Activated or not, a chill blade itself saves
against normal and magical cold, ice, and chill
effects at +2, It does not confer such bonuses on
its wielder.

The enchantment of a chill blade requires a
finely made dagger with a blade of ferrous metal,
a piece of rock crystal, a snowflake or piece of
ice, some sort of lightning or electrical discharge,
and the casting of a chill touch spell.

Dagger of Doomwarding

of Concealment
**XP Value:** 600 **GP Value:** 3,000
Drums on Fire Mountain

This magical item takes the form of a plain, gold
ring and has the properties of a ring of protection.
However, a wearer can make the ring change
instantly into a magical dagger or back into a
ring. The ring can be changed into a dagger, used
to make an attack, and changed back into a ring
all in one round. Typical daggers of concealment
give bonuses of +1 or +2 on attack rolls, damage,
Armor Class, and saving throws. Daggers of con-
cealment +3 are rumored to exist.

of Defiance
**XP Value:** 3,500 **GP Value:** 10,000
The Ruins of Myth Drannor
This dagger is of normal appearance and damage,
but any one being grasping it is instantly aided
against certain magical effects and attacks.

The wielder of a dagger of defiance is immune
to all forms of fear and repulsion. A +3 bonus to
saving throws against all enchantment/charm
attacks is also gained, as well as a +1 bonus to
saves against all polymorph and petrification
effects. This protection lasts as long as the dagger
is touched and cannot be exhausted, but can never
extend to more than one being.

The enchantment of a dagger of defiance
requires doppleganger blood and a distilled
essence of xorn flesh, and involves the casting of
Fear and repulsion spells.

charges are used, it becomes a simple dagger +1.
A charge is drained whenever the being grasping
the dagger’s hilt wills it (the number of charges
left can be felt at all times).

Using a charge from a dagger of doomwarding
allows its wielder an extra action or chance in bad

situations: an extra, additional attack in a given

Dragonfang

The Ruins of Myth Drannor

This normal-appearing dagger does normal dam-
age unless its power is invoked. It can emit a
straight line, 90-foot-long lightning bolt from its tip
four times a day (but only twice in any one turn).
The bolt does 2d8+1 points of damage to all beings
in its path (save vs. spell equals half damage).

If the lightning is invoked as the dagger strikes
a being, no bolt is produced, but the struck being
takes the full lightning damage in addition to the
dagger’s physical bite. No saving throw is allowed
the being, even if it is normally immune to such
attacks. Any dragonfang dagger attack does dou-
ble damage (no saves allowed) to all dragons,
including oriental dragons, spacefaring and
other-planar dragons, and dracoliches.

Elven
**XP Value:** 200 **GP Value:** 1,600
DUNGEON Magazine 17

This weapon, created for elven warrior comman-
ders, is fashioned of a mithral silver and steel
alloy. It possesses the ability to detect giant-class
creatures at a range of 200 feet outdoors, 100 feet
indoors or underground. The blade of the dagger
glows a faint white-blue when such a creature is
at the extreme range of its detection ability. The
glow intensifies as the giant-class creature gets
closer, until the blade is shining with the equiva-
lent of a light spell.

This dagger is +3 to attack and to damage
giant-class creatures only. When attacking other
creatures, it is considered to be a +1 magical

; eee

weapon, but it strikes and wounds as a normal
dagger. If desired, the elven dagger can be com-
manded to dim its light or to withhold its radi-
ance when stealth and concealment are important.
The blade glows only when giant-class creatures
are near, not by any command. Any giant-class
creature that holds or touches the weapon receives
1d4 points of damage per round of contact.

of the Evil Eye

This weapon appears as a simple magical dagger.
However, an individual who uses this weapon in
combat immediately receives the effects of the
evil eye. The evil eye may be removed by using an
avert evil eye spell (see Arabian Adventures), but
the spell effects will be reinstated as soon as the
weapon is used again in combat. Other weapons
may be affected by this form of the evil eye, but
daggers are the most common ones. Such weap-
ons usually have a history and once belonged to
some hero or other legendary figure.

Fang of the Nosferatu

"iceman emenme

small, coiling emerald-green snake head and
torso up to 6 inches long.

This “blade” has no cutting edge and cannot be
used to sever ropes, parry other weapons, or the
like. Its use does not alter the wielder’s THACO.
A successful attack does only 1 hp piercing dam-
age, but the struck victim must save against poi-
son or suffer the snake’s venom effect. A being
who successfully saves against the poison of a
fang dagger is forever immune to the poison of
that particular dagger.

The poison effects of a fang dagger vary with
the type of snake used, and may be of injected
types A, B, C, D, E, F, or O (see Table 51 in the
DMG). The venom is never exhausted, no matter
how often the blade is used, unless the blade’s
head is destroyed. The snake head is itself AC 6
and is destroyed if it suffers more than four hp
damage in a round. It makes all saving throws as
a 1 HD monster.

The making of such a blade requires a live
snake (of the poison type desired), an intact dag-
ger, and a secret ritual involving the powdering of
gems, the casting of a temporal stasis spell, and
the use of a drop of sovereign glue.

Fang of the Nosferatu
**XP Value:** — **GP Value:** 18,000
Forbidden Lore

There are few things as vile and dark as the
undead. These masters of evil move beneath the
fleeting light of the moon, feeding upon the
human race like wolves upon sheep. The fang of
the nosferatu was forged in their image and
placed into the hands of man, It is hard to imag-
ine a more sinister gift.

Description: The blade of this dagger is of
hardened steel, with strange, flowing symbols
etched into the metal surface. The grooves of the
lettering have all been filled with ruby dust, giv-
ing them the appearance of being written in blood
upon the blade. The handle is wrapped in an odd,
pebbled, black hide. It is thought to be mind

o~A wv & WwW bY

 

flayer or doppleganger skin. The pommel has a
ruby mounted in a steel setting. The guard is an
elongated oval, with the surface facing the blade
carved to resemble a vampire with bared fangs.
The eyes are filled with ruby dust, like the sym-
bols etched into the blade.

Powers: The fang betrays an aura of necro-
mancy when examined by detect magic. It is a
dagger +3, the extra three points of damage that
it inflicts are assumed to represent the dagger’s
drinking of the blood of its victim. If left in a
body, it drains an additional 3 hit points of blood
each round.

The dagger is not without other useful powers.
Each successful attack that drains blood gives an
owner | recovered hit point. Even if the blade
causes several points of damage with the strike,
the owner still regains only 1 point. An owner
must be wielding the blade for this power to
work, If another creature is using the blade, the
dagger is satiated, but the true owner does not
recover any hit points. There is rumored to be a
special ritual involving the dagger that grants an
owner immortality.

The fang of the nosferatu grants other powers
to its owner as well. While it is in his or her
immediate possession, an owner can shapechange

into a wolf or a bat. In these forms the owner has
1,256

 

4 361 \
the maximum hit points for that type of creature.
If the character’s true form has fewer hit points
due to wounds, then the animal form is wounded
to that level as well. Changing shape in this man-
ner does not recover any lost hit points. None of
the owner’s equipment changes, except the dag-
ger. If the owner already has a shapechanging
power (from lycanthropy, for example) then the
blade grants the power to change into any animal
form of small to large size, but not into that of a
monster or other humanoid.

The Curse: Like the nosferatu for which it is
named, the blade thirsts for blood. Each hit point
of blood that it absorbs satiates it for a day. Since
the blood is being measured in hit points, it must
come from a wound inflicted upon a living crea-
ture by the dagger, Animal blood will do just fine,
but once a month the fang requires the blood of
an intelligent creature. It cannot be satiated for
more than seven days, regardless of how much
blood it absorbs. Any day that it is not satiated, it
draws one hit point from its owner. This can hap-
pen even if the dagger and its owner are far apart.
If they are in different domains or different planes
of existence, the effects are temporarily halted
until they are reunited, Hit points lost in this man-
ner can be recovered only by using the dagger
(see below) or with a Aeal or wish spell.

The dagger is bonded to its owner as soon as it
has been used to draw blood. Neither its useful
effects nor its curses apply until this time. Once
bonded, the new owner becomes immediately
aware of the blood requirements of the blade and
the permanency of the bond, The owner will be
reluctant to give away the blade. If another creature
has it and doesn’t use it, the true owner slowly
withers and dies, at one hit point a day. The current
owner must die before a new owner can be selected.

History: This cursed dagger was once the
closely guarded possession of Mordal the assas-
sin. It was a gift from the Baron Von Kharkov,
dark lord of Valachan. When Mordal betrayed his
master, the vampire stole the dagger and impris-
oned the traitor. He encased the dagger outside
the assassin’s cell, just out of his reach, Mordal
died a little each day as the dagger was denied its
blood. On every full moon, the Baron slaughtered
animals with the dagger, restoring Mordal to nor-
mal health. However, since he never took the life
of an intelligent creature with it, one hit point
every month was lost permanently. It took the
assassin almost three years to die.

~~, Flying Dagger rc

Upon Mordal’s death, the dagger vanished.
Legend says that the ghost of the assassin took
the dagger and fled from Valachan. Nobody has
ever dared to ask Baron Von Kharkov about the
matter. Occasionally someone reports seeing a
transparent, wraith-like figure holding forth a
dagger, as if begging for someone to take it.

Flying

**XP Value:** 3,000 **GP Value:** 15,000
DUNGEON Magazine 18
A flying dagger darts about silently, point first,
and is typically about 9 inches in length. One to
12 such daggers are usually encountered. This
useful magical item was very popular as an ani-
mated guardian in the past lore of the Forgotten
Realms. Many different specimens can still be
found (so the DM can freely alter the statistics of
an individual flying dagger). The secrets of magi-
cally animating daggers are known to few living
mages.

An average flying dagger has an Armor Class
of 5, a Movement rating of 24, a Maneuverability
Class of A, and 1+1 Hit Dice. It attacks three
times per round, striking as a 3 HD monster and
doing 1d4 hit points damage per strike (1d3 vs.
Large size opponents). Such a dagger is consid-
ered a magical weapon for attack purposes.

Flying daggers are neutral, nonintelligent, and
cannot be affected by psionic or magical mental
control. A dispel magic spell cast on one of these
daggers causes it to become inanimate and harm-
less for 20 turns.

Flying daggers are usually enchanted to attack
anything that moves within 60 feet. The spells
that cause such daggers to swoop, dart, and detect
opponents also prevent rusting and brittleness
resulting from extreme heat and cold. The activa-
tion conditions for a given dagger can be as gen-
eral as “attack all intruders” or as specific as the
most elaborate triggering conditions of a magic
mouth spell. Some flying daggers can reflect or
are immune to certain spells.

Some flying daggers can be enchanted with
special abilities—immunity or reflection of cer-
tain spells; their touch can rust metal items as a
rust monster (items struck must save vs. lightning
or rust—a flying dagger strikes metal when it
attacks a target creature carrying or wearing
something metal, and its attack roll misses by
only one point); or perhaps the flying daggers can
even deliver a shocking grasp effect upon contact.

This item was very popular as an animated
guardian in elder days. Many different specimens
can still be found (a DM can freely alter the sta-
tistics of an individual flying dagger). The secrets
of magically animating such daggers are known
to few living mages; 1d12 such daggers are usu-
ally found. A flying dagger darts about silently,
point first, and is usually 9 inches long. The trig-
ger activating a dagger can be as general as
“attack all intruders” or as specific as the most
elaborate triggering conditions of a magic mouth
spell.

An average flying dagger is AC 5; MV Fl 24
(A); HD 1+1; hp 9 each; THACO 17; AT 3; Dmg
1d4; and is considered a magical weapon for pur-
poses of deciding what it can hit. Flying daggers
cannot be affected by any sort of mental control.

The spells that cause a flying dagger to swoop,
dart, and detect opponents—it is usually
enchanted to attack anything within 60 feet that
moves—also prevent rusting and brittleness due
to extreme heat and cold. A dagger that success-
fully strikes a moving arrow or thrown weapon,
deflects it, if a DM desires.

Some flying daggers can reflect, or are immune
to, certain spells, or have special abilities, for
example, their touch can rust metal items as a
Tust monster’s antenna does. Items struck must
save vs. lightning or rust. A flying dagger strikes
metal when it is attacking a target being carrying
or wearing something metal, and its attack roll
misses by only one to three points.

**XP Value:** 2,500 **GP Value:** 7,500
DRAGON Magazine 169

First popularized by High Lady Alustriel of Sil-
verymoon, these amusing and effective daggers
emit a continuous snarling noise, like a small and
angry dog when drawn and held. The snarls
become barks whenever the blade actually strikes
a living target. Opponents touched but not
wounded by the blade of a Grimwald’s dagger
must save vs. spell or shudder helplessly with
laughter on the following round (-2 on saving
throws, Strength checks, Armor Class, and attack
rolls). This effect lasts for one round but may
recur each time contact is made with the blade.
Once per day, the wielder of this type of dagger
can cause it to savage an opponent. This causes
the blade to emit a shrill, ululating screaming
noise (audible up to half a mile away in good con-
ditions) and grants the wielder two rounds of has-
tened attacking (double attacks, -2 initiative
bonus, and no aging). During this time, the dag-
ger gains an additional +1 attack and damage
bonus its base damage is doubled.

This sort of dagger is named for its inventor,
the wizard Grimwald, who delighted in teasing

Hornblade
**XP Value** **GP Value**
Knife-sized: 500 1,750
Dagger-sized: 750 2,000

DUNGEON MASTER Guide, 1st Edition

This is a magical weapon with a sickle blade that
resembles some sort of animal horn. Hornblades
range in size from that of a knife to somewhat
less than the length of a short sword. Even a close
inspection is 90% unlikely to reveal it as anything
other than a piece of horn of 4 to 1% foot in
length, set in some sort of handle or grip. If detect
magic is used, a hornblade faintly radiates
enchantment magic. However, if the proper pres-
sure is applied in the correct place, a curved blade
of great strength and sharpness springs out.

The small versions (knife- and dagger-sized)
are usually enchanted to +1 or +2, and the largest
version (scimitar-sized) commonly has a bonus of
+2 or +3. Smaller hornblades can be thrown, and
the bonus applies to both attack and damage rolls.

Any character class permitted to use sickle
weapons can use a hornblade. The possessor can
use it with proficiency, providing he or she has
proficiency with the appropriately sized weapon.

of Illusory Metal
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 5,000
Prince of Lankhmar
This dagger does not give a bonus to attack or dam-
age rolls. It does, however, allow the attacker to
ignore normal, metal armor (not magical armor).
This is because the dagger passes through metallic
armor as though it were illusionary armor.

The dagger also passes through stone and brick
as though they weren’t there. Neither handle nor a
user’s arm gains the ability to pass through metal
or stone, only the dagger’s blade can do this.

The magical protection from spells and from

i i

rings, dexterity, cloaks, and all other nonmetallic
armor bonuses work as normal, giving the wearer
a better than standard Armor Class, but the
Armor Class bonus from metal armor itself is
nullified.

The dagger does the normal damage of
1d4/1d3 as long as it is never damaged. It cannot
be damaged by any rock or metallic object, which
makes damaging it very difficult. Whittling and
other wood cutting is possible, but using a sharp-
ening stone is impossible. So, once this blade
becomes dull, it remains dull unless magic that
sharpens and hones blades can be utilized.

The blade does not radiate any discernible
light, but it does appear to be cloudy, it looks
more like the clouds in the sky than metal.

If detect magic is cast upon the blade, the
caster can see an unmistakable magical aura. If
an identify spell is cast, the caster can determine
that the spells used in making the item are necro-
mantic, alteration, and invocation. Also during
the casting of the identify spell, the caster can see
an entity made of air and steam thrashing about
as though it were trying to get out.

of Impaling

The Complete Thief’s Handbook

These daggers are +2 on attack and damage, and
on a natural roll of 20 (19 if this is sufficient to
score a hit) on a backstab attack, they impale the
target, inflicting an additional 1d4+2/1d3+2
points of damage, and stay in the wound, where
they cause an additional 1d4+2/1d3+2 points of
damage each round until removed.

lyarim’s flying dagger is enchanted to attack
anything that moves, within 60 feet. The spells
that cause the dagger to swoop, dart, and detect
opponents also prevents rusting and brittleness
resulting from extreme heat and cold. The activa-
tion conditions for the dagger can be as general
as “attack all intruders” or as specific as the most
elaborate conditions of a magic mouth spell.

lyarim’s flying daggers have a special ability;
their touch can rust metal items as a rust mon-
ster’s antennae. Items struck must save vs. light-
ning or rust. (A flying dagger strikes metal when
it is attacking a target carrying or wearing some-
thing metal, and its attack roll misses by only
one, two, or three points.) /yarim's daggers have
9 hit points.

Jump
**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 10,000
DRAGON Magazine 169
This magical weapon looks and functions as a
normal dagger, but it has three special powers.
One operates automatically, affecting the blade
and any one creature grasping it as if by a feather
fall spell. This power is negated only during the
use of the next power described. A wielder can, at
will, make one jump (as the Ist-level wizard
spell) every other round, so long as the weapon is

grasped (it need not be drawn). The weapon must
accompany the wielder.

A wielder can also move small, nonliving
objects about by pointing the blade at the object
and willing the effect to occur. An attack roll is
required, and the object will jump up to 30 feet
away, its distance and direction set by the wielder
of the jump dagger. The objects cannot be larger
than 3 feet in any dimension and must weigh less
than 100 pounds.

This property is often used to pass weapons,
keys, and valuables to another being, or to snatch
them away from an enemy, such as a mage ready-
ing spell components, If it is used to launch an
attack (even indirectly, such as a lit torch being
directed at a flammable object), the DM should
Tequire a successful attack roll to ensure that the
object reached its intended target.

If this power is directed at an opponent’s
weapon or other firmly held object, the opponent
is allowed a Strength check on 1d20 to retain the
hold and break the dagger’s attempt (for that
round, at least). If the check succeeds, the oppo-
nent retains full control over the weapon, and is
not penalized in any attack rolls launched during
the round. If the check fails, the weapon is
snatched out of the opponent’s grasp; magical
weapons are allowed a save vs. spell to be unaf-
fected, with a bonus equaling any “pluses” they
possess. The opponent can never be overbalanced
or pulled along by the affected item.

The making of jump daggers requires feather
fall, jump, and levitate spells, in combination
with a special tempering. The oil for the quench-
ing of the tempering process must contain blink
dog or displacer beast blood or beholder ichor,
stirred and mixed well.

DUNGEON MASTER Guide, 1st Edition

This appears to be a normal weapon, or perhaps a
nonspecial, magical weapon. However, when this
broad-bladed weapon is wielded by a small demi-
human (a gnome or halfling), it actually length-
ens and functions as a short sword (retaining its
+2 bonus). Even when functioning in this way, it
remains as light as a dagger would be in the
hands of the same character. The weapon actually
penetrates wood and stone as easily as it enters
softer materials, inflicting maximum damage
against either substance.

Tales of the Lance
Raistlin Majere purchased this dagger from the
Tower of High Sorcery, giving in exchange a valu-
able magical item he found in his early days of

7

mercenary service. He carried the dagger on his
right forearm by means of a cunningly designed
leather thong of his own making. This allowed the
dagger to slip into his hand with a simple move-
ment of his wrist. Six inches long, this silver dagger
is carved in the shape of a dragon with the tail as
the blade. It is slender and lightweight and can eas-
ily be hidden upon the person of the mage. The
dagger has a +3 bonus on both attack and damage
rolls. It also has the ability to remain undetected in
a search of the mage’s person.

POLYHEDRON Newszine 43
This bejewelled, ornate silver blade acts as a +2
weapon in the hands of anyone but neutral good
mages. In their hands, it becomes a +5 weapon. It
augments their effective character level by 2
when carried, the level increase applying to
spells, hit points, and attack tables. It is semisen-
tient, and can communicate with its owner fele-
pathically. It is rumored to have some other
innate abilities, but sages differ on the details. It
has a neutral good alignment, an Ego of 19, an
Intelligence of 23, and knows the following lan-
guages: Common, Elf, Dwarf, Halfling, and
Gnome.

It once belonged to the renowned mage Mervic,
who always carried it with him. It was found by a
group of adventurers who searched his fortress
after hearing rumors of his mysterious disappear-
ance, but it was lost in later years and is said to be
in the hoard of a particularly loathsome lich.

Rabbitslayer
**GP Value:** 1,500

Tales of the Lance
Tas brags about how his lucky knife always
finds its way back to him. Called rabbitslayer
(because Caramon said it would only be of use
against ferocious rabbits), the dagger’s origin
remains unclear. Tas claimed he found it in the
cursed lands near Xak Tsaroth. Goldmoon once
pronounced the blade “blessed by the gods”
and “more powerful than imagined.” Others
scoffed.

Rabbitslayer is a dagger +4. It always returns
to its owner’s hands within 1d20 hours after it is
lost or stolen. Only if it is willingly given away
does rabbitslayer gain a new owner.

These rather exquisite throwing daggers are +2
on attack and damage, and function normally if
used in hand. There is a catch—if thrown, the
daggers pick their own targets. Whenever they are
thrown, everyone within a range of 30 feet
(including the user) is counted as a potential tar-
get, up to a maximum of the 20 nearest creatures.
An appropriate die is then rolled to randomly
determine the target. The usual steps to determine
attacks are then followed. To most people, these
daggers would seem evil or cursed, but they are
weapons that jesters love in their own mischie-
vous ways. Random target daggers are usually
found in groups of three,

Rust Blade
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 5,000

DRAGON Magazine 169

These rare weapons have constantly operating,
involuntary powers. Whenever the naked blade of
a rust blade directly touches metal (a successful
attack roll is required), the metal rusts, crumbling
to useless shards and flakes in one round. Magi-
cal metallic items contacting a rust blade have a
chance of escaping destruction equal to 10% per
plus (a dagger +1 has a 10% chance of being
unaffected). Special powers or abilities may, at
the DM’s option, be considered equivalent to
additional bonuses. A rod of lordly might, for
example, has 10 powers, and could be considered
to have a 100% chance of escaping a rust blade’s
effects. Consider all magical items that are not
weapons or armor of some sort to have a 20%
base chance of being unaffected.

These weapons cannot be carried in metal
scabbards—they are as much a hazard to the
wielder and allies as they are to enemies. The cre-
ation of these weapons requires some of the flesh
of a rust monster’s antennae. If a rust monster
smells such a blade, it will attack it over all other
possible metallic meals. A rust blade touched by
a rust monster antenna collapses into a hot,
sparkling gray liquid that a rust monster will
immediately devour, after that falling into a con-
tented doze. The liquid takes 1d4+1 turns to
digest but acts as a healing agent and growth
stimulant, giving the affected rust monster full
(40) hit points. In rust monsters at full hit points,
devouring a rust blade awakens a strong urge to

Found only in undersea lairs, this weapon is a
coral or shark-tooth dagger made by powerful
sahuagin priests. These daggers are +1, but +2
when used against dolphins; they have a lawful
evil alignment, and anyone of another alignment
finds that such daggers function as -1 cursed
weapons when used by them.

of Set
**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 10,000
Old Empires

This horrible, snake-shaped blade is a throwing
dagger used by warriors in the service of Set. It is
a dagger +2, with a typical range. Should it roll a
natural 19 or 20, it has found a vital organ of its
victim and kills instantly. Furthermore, it remains
in the wound and continues to inflict 1d4+2
points of damage each round, until it is pulled
free (an 18 or greater Strength is required to pull
it from the wound; the action takes one round).
For each round it is in the wound, roll 1d20; ifa
19 or 20 is ever rolled, it has found a vital organ
and killed its target. The number of daggers of Set
that exist is unknown.

of Sounding
**XP Value:** 300 **GP Value:** 3,000
The Complete Thief’s Handbook

This oddly designed dagger is +1 for attack and
damage, but it has a peculiar, hollow bronze bulb
at the tip of the pommel. If the tip is gently
tapped against a hollow surface, it gives a
resounding ring, quite different from the dull tone
emitted if struck against solid stone. Tapping it
gently against walls allows a thief a 5 in 6 chance
to find a secret door, rising to 11 in 12 if the thief
is elven or halfelven. Also, the thief can search
for secret doors at twice the normal rate when
using this dagger. In other cases, the thief is 80%
likely to be able to determine successfully the
approximate thickness and nature of the material
the dagger is used to sound.

Speaking

**XP Value:** 1,500 **GP Value:** 7,500
DraGon Magazine 169

When thrown, this otherwise normal dagger’s
special power is unleashed. It is +4 to attack, but
only when thrown, and upon impact it emits an
audible message. This spoken “sending” cannot
be a spell incantation, nor can it trigger any
delayed spell or activate any item or effect by
uttering a command word. It can, of course, con-
vey passwords or instructions,

Such a message reproduces the accent and tone
of the speaker, can be up to 50 words in length,
and is repeated each time the dagger is thrown.
(The irritation that a mocking comment can pro-
duce makes it a favorite of Calishite torturers,
who throw it near the arms and legs of bound
prisoners in the darkness, without warning and at
irregular intervals.)

Only one message can be spoken over the dag-
ger in a day. A code word (not part of the message,
nor counted in its word length) begins and ends the
dagger’s “recording” of a message, which may be
implanted by any being knowing the word and
having the power of speech. If the word is spoken
twice over the blade, with nothing being said in
between, the blade will bear no message.

The making of such blades is known to require
the crushing of certain gems, the casting of a
magic mouth spell, and uttering the code word,

which can never be changed after that.

Spider Fang
**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 10,000
DRAGON Magazine 169

These daggers are always black or dark purple in
color. Their touch causes all nonmagical ropes,
bindings, and magical or natural webs to part
instantly, Despite the name, this weapon has no
effect on poisons and does not itself employ poi-
son. Once every six turns, a spider fang can emit
a web from its tip. Such webs are in all respects
identical to those created by the spell and last for
four turns, if not destroyed earlier. A spider fang
can also emit a curtain of cobwebs once a day.
This shroudlike, oval curtain hangs upright in
midair, always 6 feet in front of the point of the
dagger. The curtain partially obscures the vision
of others, so that they may not be able to identify
the wielder of the spider fang, and it causes all
nonmagical missile attacks (excluding those from
siege engines) against the wielder to be launched
at -1 to hit and damage.

A curtain of cobwebs acts in all other respects
like a shield spell, except that it has no effect at
all on magic missiles. It lasts for seven rounds,
moving as the point of the dagger is moved, and
may be positioned over a window or portal and
left there, if the wielder leaves the dagger on a
table or jammed into a crevice.

If a curtain of cobwebs contacts any living
being who is not at the same time also touching
the spider fang that created it, it collapses
instantly all over the being, doing 1d3 hp corro-
sive damage. A curtain of cobwebs is destroyed
instantly by any contact with flame, being con-
sumed with a flash and a roar. If this occurs at the
same time that the curtain contacts a creature, the
creature suffers an additional 2d4 hp fiery dam-
age (save vs. spell for half flame damage).

The creation of spider fangs is known to
involve the ichor and web silk of driders or cer-
tain monstrous types of spiders, shield and web
spells, and a complicated brew of strange ingredi-
ents in which the blade must be submerged for
several days.

Dagger of Truth

weapon that never tarnishes, breaks, or loses its
sharpness. When grasped and commanded, it
empowers the wielder to see invisible creatures
and objects within a 60-foot range. This sight also
shows the alignment auras and dweomers of
beings and items viewed.

A tooth of Torm is not wielded in battle, but if
released while under a command to strike, it will
blink away to attack any selected target creature
up to 30 feet away, striking and returning within a
round. It cannot be grasped while attacking or
returning, and comes to float beside its comman-
der’s shoulder. No living creature can travel with
it, but hand-sized or smaller, nonliving items
strapped or tied to the blade are carried along
with it. It obeys only lawful good beings, and
burns (for 1d2 points of damage per touch, or per
round of continual contact) chaotic evil creatures
upon contact.

A tooth of Torm can also be commanded to
guard. The commander holds the dagger with its
point toward the object or area to be guarded
(such as a door, altar, or archway), positions it as
needed, and then releases it. The commander then
repeats the word “guard” continually until the
dagger has reached or is touching the area or
object to be guarded. The dagger then hovers in
place indefinitely, until it is affected by dispel
magic or the guarded area is violated, whereon it
blinks to the attack. The dagger will strike repeat-
edly, once per round, until the guarded object or
area is no longer touched or disturbed, or until the
dagger itself is destroyed. (An intruder who flees
empty-handed thus suffers only a single attack
from the dagger.)

Note that the commander of the dagger, or any
lawful good creature, cannot cause the dagger to
activate, even if such a creature does disturb or
enter the guarded item or area. An avatar or high
servant (being from another plane) of Torm can-
not cause a tooth of Torm to strike either. The
presence of all other worshipers of Torm who are
not lawful good will cause the dagger to strike.
Any number of teeth can be combined to guard a
single object; it was common practice of old to
place a ring of teeth in the air above a coffer con-
taining temple treasures each night, as an inner
guard on the valuables.

of Vengeance
**XP Value:** 1,300 **GP Value:** 6,500
Tales of the Lance
This double-edged dagger has a nasty barb at its
tip and a fuller that runs its entire length. The
pommel of the dagger is wrapped in serpent skin
and bears a flaming red garnet. Legends praise
this weapon as the bringer of righteous revenge.

From the time of its mysterious beginnings, the
dagger of vengeance has wandered Krynn, wreak-
ing terrible tragedy and advancing the cause of
evil. Ever it follows in the path of the magical
item Trueheart'’s Warding; often has it slain the
wearer of the armband. No one knows who now
bears the dagger of vengeance.

The dagger of vengeance appears to be a dag-
ger of venom. It secretes its own extremely viru-
lent poison (save vs. poison -2). If employed in
what the wielder perceives to be an act of ven-
geance, the blade backstabs at +4 on the attack
roll, causes 1d4+2 points of damage, and requires
a save vs. poison at -2. On a roll of 18 to 20 on

1d20, the dagger injects a second dose of poison,
1,301

 

370

x,
requiring a second save vs. poison at -4.

The dagger of vengeance slowly gains control
over anyone who wields it, especially those who
harbor anger or jealousy. With each use, the dag-
ger gradually shifts a wielder’s thoughts to
chaotic evil. The ranks shift as follows: lawful
good, neutral good, chaotic good, lawful neutral,
neutral, chaotic neutral, lawful evil, neutral evil,
chaotic evil. The dagger makes a wielder para-
noid, temperamental, and quick to anger. When-
ever a PC or NPC performs an action that the
character might consider a threat, the DM should
have a bearer of the dagger of vengeance make a
Wisdom check minus the number of times the
player has used the dagger. If the check fails, the
player goes into a paranoid rage and attacks the
offender. “Vengeance will be mine!”

If the dagger is stolen, it continues to call out
to previous owners across the miles. Any owner
who has a combined Intelligence and Wisdom of
less than 27 must pursue the dagger fanatically,
seeking its return.

This dagger is one of the three artifacts in the
Triad of Betrayal created by Reorx and imbued
with the essence of Hiddukel. He created the dag-
ger of vengeance as a foil to Mishakal’s Trueheart’s
warding. The dagger seeks out the owner of True-
heart's warding and strives to destroy him or her.

Mishakal bestowed the three artifacts of the
Circle of Love on the lovers Trae and Mirri, and
Trae’s brother Heris. These artifacts bound them
together, bringing about a peace between their
feuding families. Hiddukel plotted to destroy that
peace. He bestowed the dagger of vengeance
upon Lady Dobal, who lusted after the heart of
the mage Heris. Lady Dobal feared the impend-
ing alliance between the feuding families. She
planned to slay the warrior and his bride to free
Heris’s heart for her alone. Through treachery,
Lady Dobal shattered the new alliance. But when
Trae and Mirmi lay dead, Heris took his own life,
leaving Lady Dobal again alone.

age; 2d6, 2d10, or 2d20 are recommended
amounts).

of Blinking

**XP Value:** 200 **GP Value:** 800
DuNGEONS & Dracons Rules Cyclopedia
A missile with this talent cannot hit any friend of
the user, “blinking” in and out of existence until it
reaches an enemy, (If the sight of the enemy is
blocked by friends, a penalty may apply to the
attack roll.)

of Branding
**XP Value:** 200 **GP Value:** 1,500
The Magister
When thrown, darts of branding burst into blind-
ing flame, unquenchable by water or cold, and
this conflagration leaves a branded mark where
the dart strikes. The marks are usually shaped by
careful construction of the dart into runes or
devices. The dartfire consumes the weapon and
does 1d6+3 points more damage than normal
darts. Creatures not resistant to fire get no save
vs. the fiery damage, but darffire is relatively fee-
ble and does no damage if the target is protected
by a resist fire, dispel magic, or more powerful
protective spell. Darts of branding can pass
undamaged through a wall of fire, however, and
derive additional heat from the wall, doing one
point of additional damage for every 1 inch (and
remaining fraction) of flames they pass through.
Flame strike and flame arrow spells have no
effect on darts of branding.

of Charming
**XP Value:** 200 **GP Value:** 500
DunGeons & Dracons Rules Cyclopedia
The victim hit must make a saving throw vs. spell
or be charmed by the user (as the charm person
or charm monster mage spell).

of Climbing
**XP Value:** 200 **GP Value:** 600
Dunceons & Dracons Rules Cyclopedia
This talent only functions if the dart is fired at an
object. The missile securely fastens itself to any
object it hits and then creates a magical 50-foot
rope, issuing from the spot where it struck. The
rope supports any weight of climbers and disap-
pears one turn later or upon command of the user.

The dart cannot be moved after it hits, and it dis-
appears when the rope does.

of Curing
**XP Value:** 200 **GP Value:** 1,000
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Rules Cyclopedia
A dart with this talent is obviously blunt,
inscribed with a holy symbol. When it hits a liv-
ing creature, it does not inflict damage. Instead, it
cures 2d6 points of damage plus 2 extra points for
each magical bonus of the missile. For example,
if a 5 is rolled for a curing arrow +2, the total

points of damage cured are 9.
Death
**XP Value** **GP Value**
Large: 4,000 16,000
Small: 5,000 20,000
Menzoberranzan Campaign Set

This dart is similar to the surface-world guardian
known as a flying dagger. Few drow mages know
how to fashion them (and fewer still will admit to
knowing how, for fear of being captured and
enslaved by a noble house, and set to making
endless darts for protection and sale). They are
eagerly sought after by noble and wealthy drow.

In old hoards, 1d8 such weapons are usually
found. Sometimes one or more is set atop or
inside a chest, with instructions to attack all liv-
ing things except the being who placed them
there (or someone named as having access). A
death dart resembles a 9-inch-long, black needle.
It has a flared but-end, tapers swiftly, and then
thickens more gradually to a bulge in the center,
before thinning down to a long, deadly point (so
that the ‘bulge’ looks like two back-to-back
cones, large ends placed together). When con-
structed, a dart is either set to activate at a whis-
pered command word (to be carried about for
personal defense), or given activation conditions
as specific as the most elaborate triggering condi-
tions of a magic mouth spell. Once determined,
the activation conditions of a given dart can never
be altered.

Once activated, a death dart flies about silently,
point-first. Death darts cannot be affected by any
sort of mental control. The spells that enable a
death dart to swoop, dart, and detect opponents
(they are usually set to attack anything within 60
feet that moves) also prevent rusting and brittle-
ness due to extreme heat and cold. A dart that

successfully strikes a moving arrow or thrown
1,312

 

372

we
weapon, can deflect it, if the DM desires.

Some death darts can reflect, or are immune to,
certain spells, or have special abilities; for exam-
ple, their touch can rust metal items as a rust mon-
ster’s antenna does. Items struck must save vs.
lightning or rust. A death dart strikes metal when
it is attacking a target being carrying or wearing
something metal, and its attack roll misses by one
to three points. A few (25%) death darts carry
sleep or damaging poison. Poison damage is added
to physical damage for the first three strikes of the
dart, the target saves vs. poison normally for the
first strike, at + 2 for the second, and at +4 for the
third (after that, the poison has been exhausted). A
dart can be anointed with poison as often as its
activator has the means and desire.

Most death darts are AC 4; MV F1 24 (A); HD
1+1; hp 9 each; THACO 17; AT 3; Dmg 1d4; and
are considered magical weapons for purposes of
deciding what they can hit. A few darts may differ
slightly from this norm, usually being larger, and
AC 6; MV F1 20 (A); HD 2; THACO 17; AT 2;
Dmg 1d6+1.

Death I
**XP Value:** 3,000 **GP Value:** 13,000
The Endless Stair
This rare item always appears as a small, coin-
sized disc of brass, with compass directions
engraved on one side, and a command word on
the other. The side with the compass points has a
brass pointer on it, set on a central swivel like the
hands of a clock.

The dart only operates when it is held in the
open hand of a living being. When it is held as the
command word is spoken, the disc instantly
becomes a dart, and flashes from the wielder’s
hand in a straight line, at the height held, in the
direction that the pointer is set (“north-north-
east”). Upon striking a target (attack roll not
required if a creature is in the flight path) or
reaching its outer limit of 120 feet, the dart drops
harmlessly to the ground, and instantly reverts to
disc form. The dart deals any struck target 1d4 hp
of damage (no saving throw). Changing the direc-
tion of the pointer must be done manually, and
takes one round. The knowledge of how to make
these darts is thought to have been lost long ago.
A dart of death is usable by any living creature
able to hold it and pronounce the command word
simultaneously.

This dart can be fired at ranges five times greater

in the same round and can be reused. A dart
inflicts a base 1d6 points of damage plus its mag-
ical bonus on a successful attack against any size
creature (44 points total). A dart that misses its

Illusory Missiles

**XP Value:** 10 **GP Value:** 100
DraGON Magazine 181

There are illusory missiles of various types, and
these complement illusory weapons and armor.
First are illusory sticks and stones. These are tiny
things, totally useless in battle normally. When
the command word is spoken, however, a faintly
visible magical field surrounds them, stretching
them out to the proportions of regular darts,
javelins, arrows, or sling bullets, Although the
field does no damage itself, it is substantial
enough to enable the missile to be handled and
used with a blowgun, bow, sling, or spear thrower.
If an enemy sees this coming, he or she will prob-
ably assume the worst and take damage equiva-
lent to that of an ordinary missile, but it’s all
show. These devices are only usable once.

of Light
**XP Value:** 20 **GP Value:** 75
POLYHEDRON Newszine 47

Several (2d10) of these glowing darts will be
found together. When they strike an object, they
explode in a burst of white light (as a continual
light spell), blinding all within the 10-foot explo-
sion area for 1d6 rounds. Shadows, shades, and
other creatures of darkness take 1d10 points of
damage from each dart.

of Lighting
**XP Value:** 200 **GP Value:** 500
Dungeons & Dracons Rules Cyclopedia
This dart can create a light spell effect (30-foot-
diameter), either upon command or when it hits a
target. If a creature is hit, the victim must make a

"nnn OEE

saving throw vs. spell or be blinded by the light
(as if the spell had been cast at its eyes). The mis-
sile disintegrates when the light is created.

of Penetrating
**XP Value:** 400 **GP Value:** 1,000
Dunceons & Dracons Rules Cyclopedia
A dart with this talent cannot be slowed by under-
brush, webs (normal or magical), or other forms
of cover. The victim’s Armor Class is not modi-
fied by cover of any sort.

of Refilling
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 5,000
DuNGEONS & DRAGONS Rules Cyclopedia
This talent gives no special effect to a dart when
fired, however, if left in a container with other
missiles of the same type (that is, a refilling dart
with normal darts or a refilling sling stone with
normal sling stones), it magically creates 1d20
more darts of the normal type each day.

of Screaming

**XP Value:** 300 **GP Value:** 900
Dunceons & Dracons Rules Cyclopedia
This dart’s effect occurs when it is fired, even if it
misses the target. As it travels through the air, the
missile produces a loud cry, causing all within 30
feet of its path to check morale. If the morale
check fails, the victims retreat in fear for 1d8
rounds.

of Seeking

**XP Value:** 200 **GP Value:** 500
DuNGEOoNS & DRAGONS Rules Cyclopedia :

When this dart is launched at an object, it automat-
ically hits any one target object within range as
long as a path of travel is clear. It may be used as a
missile of disarming, if needed, or it can be used to
sever a normal rope, pierce a sack, push a button,
or trigger a trap. It cannot be used against crea-
tures, and misses any creature at which it is aimed.

A victim hit by a dart with this talent must make
a saving throw vs. spell (at a +2 bonus) or be tele-
ported to a point 1d100 miles away, with the
direction and distance determined randomly.
Unlike the effect of the mage spell, the victim
cannot arrive in the air or within a solid object.

DuNGEONS & Dracons Rules Cyclopedia

A victim hit by a dart with this talent must make
a saving throw vs. spell or be sent to a point up to
360 feet away, as determined by the user of the
dart. The effect is identical to the mage spell
dimension door, and it cannot cause the victim to
appear within a solid object.

of Wounding
**XP Value:** 500 **GP Value:** 1,500
DunNGEONS & DRAGONS Rules Cyclopedia

When a dart of wounding strikes a creature, it
inflicts normal damage. In addition, however, it
causes the loss of 1 hit point per round after that
until magical curing is applied (a potion, cure
spell of any type, etc.). However, no undead crea-
ture or construct (golem, living statue, etc.) can
be wounded by this dart, and such creatures suf-
fer only the initial damage.

Decanter

Decanters are decorative bottles used to serve
fine drinks. Usually filled with wine, sparkling
water, or other rare nectars, decanters are found
in any wealthy home. They have richly sculpted
handles that are used to pour the drinks, as touch-
ing the decanter itself can warm the drink too
much.

Carrague’s Decanter of Endless Steam
**XP Value:** 1,250 **GP Value:** 4,000
POLYHEDRON Newszine 84
These stoppered flasks look like ordinary brass
containers. They are warm to the touch and radiate
both enchantment and conjuration/summoning
magic. When the stopper is removed and the
proper words are spoken, a constant flow of steam
will pour out. Similar to a decanter of endless
water, a decanter of endless steam has three sepa-

rate commands for the amount of steam produced:
1,334

 

375

X
 

Teakettle: A slow trickle of steam that sounds
like a low-pitched whistle forms a sphere of
scalding vapor. During the first round, the sphere
has a diameter of 2 feet. Each round thereafter the
sphere expands by | foot until it reaches a maxi-
mum diameter of 10 feet. Characters inside the
sphere take one point of damage from the steam
each round, save vs. breath weapon for no dam-
age.

Small Geyser: A translucent flow of steam
that sounds like a high pitched whistle fills a 6-
foot sphere in one round; this expands an addi-
tional 3 feet each round to a maximum diameter
of 30 feet. Characters inside the sphere take 1d6
points of damage each round, save vs. breath
weapon for half. .

Large Geyser: A gush of thick steam that
sounds like loud roaring fills a 10-foot sphere in
one round; this expands by an additional 5 feet
each round to a maximum diameter of 50 feet.
Characters inside the sphere take 3d6 points of
damage each round, save vs. breath weapon for
half damage.

The two geyser settings are used to power Car-
rague 's steam machines. The large geyser setting
produces considerable back pressure, and the
holder must be well braced or be knocked back-
wards. The force of the geyser kills small animals
and normal insects. At any setting, a command
word must be given to stop the flow of steam.

of Endless Water
**XP Value:** 1,200 **GP Value:** 3,600
Nightrage
This stoppered flask, almost always of fine work-
manship, contains a portable wormhole to the
Elemental Plane of Water. The user removes the
stopper, speaks a word of command, and a stream
of fresh water pours out. Some decanters have
variable rates of flow, but others simply flow at a
constant rate until the command word stops them.

These items tend to be rare, for the elementals
who inhabit the Plane of Water dislike them—
they drain their resources. Rumors tell of elemen-
tal patrols scouring the Prime Material Plane to
buy or steal every flask they find. Once trans-
ported to the Plane of Water, the flask’s magic is
permanently dispelled.

The decanter that created the Serpent Oasis
pours several gallons per minute in a strong
stream. It is a shapely flask of untarnished gold
with inlaid lapis lazuli in a geyser design.

This stoppered flask looks ordinary but radiates
the aura of magic. If the stopper is removed, and
the proper words spoken, a stream of fresh or salt
water pours out, as ordered. There are separate
command words for the amount as well as the
type of water. Water can be made to come forth as
follows:

¢ Stream: pours out one gallon per round.

* Fountain: 5-foot-long stream at five gallons
per round.

* Geyser: 20-foot-long stream at 30 gallons per
round, The geyser causes considerable back
pressure, and the holder must be well braced
or be knocked over. The force of the geyser
can kill small animals and insects (mice,
moles, small bats, etc.). The command word
must be given to cease the flow.

Deck of Cards

A magical deck is a pack of rectangular playing
cards, usually found as either a small deck of 10
or a large deck of 20. Each card is made of stiff
parchment, inscribed with a number or letter and
a picture of some sort. Although card decks are
common in the modern world, they are rare, hand
made in a medieval setting. The cards may be as
small as 1 by 2 inches or as large as 1 by 2 feet,
larger cards are very rare. When a card is drawn
from a deck, its magical effect is released. The
card either disappears immediately or vanishes
after a given period. Cards may be drawn once
per round at most, unless specified otherwise.

Inside Raven’s Bluff, The Living City

Only 12 such decks are known to exist. Each
deck starts with 50 cards, and is therefore good
for 50 fortunes. A character pulls a card from the
deck and rolls 1d12. The number rolled corre-
sponds to the number of months in the future the
forecasted event will occur. The card shimmers,
becomes three-dimensional, and shows a scene
involving the character who pulled the card. For
example, a card could show the character finding
a great fortune, being killed in battle with a mon-
ster, finding his or her true love, or any other
scene the DM wishes. The scene is played out
before the character for three minutes, then the
card vanishes. It is possible to alter the future of
the card by certain actions; but the card does not
reveal what those actions are.

DUNGEON MASTER Guide, lst Edition

A deck of many things is usually found in a box
or leather pouch. Each deck contains a number of
cards or plaques, made of ivory or vellum. Each
card is engraved with glyphs, characters, and
magical sigils. As soon as one of these cards is
drawn from the pack, its magic is bestowed upon
the person who drew it—for better or worse.

The character with a deck of many things may
announce that he or she is drawing only one card or
the owner may draw two, three, four, or more. How-
ever, the number must be announced prior to draw-
ing the first card. If a jester is drawn, the possessor
of the deck may elect to draw two additional cards.

Each time a card is taken from the deck it is
replaced (making it possible to draw the same
card twice) unless the draw is a jester or fool, in
that case the card is discarded from the pack. A
deck of many things contains either 13 cards
(75% chance) or 22 cards (25%). Additional
cards in a 22-card deck are shown below by an
asterisk (*) before their names. To simulate the
magical cards you may want to use the normal
playing card in the suits indicated in the second
column. (The notation is face value, then suit.)

Upon drawing the last card, or immediately
upon drawing the cards in bold face (The Void
and Donjon), the deck disappears. The cards are
explained in greater detail below:

points and draw again,

Sun: Roll for a miscellaneous magical item
until a useful item is indicated.

Moon: This is best represented by a moon-
stone gem with the appropriate number of wishes

”  Nheareeneemnnernannemienmeneteereneameaemnteeeeranerepaaetseesseeeemmamemammemmrmmall

shown as gleams therein. The wishes are the same
as the 9th-level wizard spell and must be used in
a number of turns equal to the number received.

Star: If the two points would place the charac-
ter’s score at 19, use one or both in any of the
other abilities in this order—Constitution, Cha-
risma, Wisdom, Dexterity, Intelligence, Strength.

Comet: The player must singlehandedly defeat
the next hostile monster (or monsters!) encoun-
tered or the benefit is lost. If successful, the char-
acter moves to the midpoint of the next experience
level.

Throne: If Charisma is 18 already, the individ-
ual still gains five on encounter and loyalty reac-
tions, He or she becomes a real leader in people’s
eyes. The castle gained is near a stronghold
already held.

Key: DM must prepare a treasure map. The
weapon must be one usable by the character so
use the Magical Weapons Table until a useful
item is awarded,

Knight: The fighter joins the character as a
henchman and serves loyally until death. The
fighter has +1 per die (18 maximum) on each
ability roll.

Gem: This indicates wealth. The jewelry is
always gold set with gems, the gems are all of
1,000 gp base value. With this wealth should
come experience points equal in value, but never
more than needed to increase one level of experi-
ence.

The Void: This black card spells instant disas-
ter. The character’s body continues to function,

_ though he or she speaks like an automaton, but

the psyche is trapped in a prison somewhere—in
an object on a far planet or plane, possibly in the
possession of an outer planar creature. A wish
cannot bring the character back, but the plane of
entrapment might be revealed. Draw no more
cards.

Flames: Hot anger, jealousy, and envy are but
a few of the possible motivational forces for the
enmity. The enmity of the outer planar creature
can’t be ended until one of the parties has been
slain.

Skull: A minor Death appears (AC -4; 33 hit
points: strikes with a scythe for 2d8 points, never
missing, always striking first in a round). The
character must fight it alone—if others help, they
get minor Deaths to fight as well. If the character
is slain, he or she is slain forever. Treat the Death
as undead with respect to spells. Cold, fire, and

1,348

XM
electrical energy do not harm it.

Talons: When this card is drawn, every magi-
cal item the character has is irrevocably gone,
instantly.

Ruin: As implied, when this card is drawn
every bit of money (including all gems, jewelry,
treasure, and art objects) is lost. All land and
buildings owned are lost forever as well.

Euryale: The medusa visage on this card
brings a curse only the Fates card or godlike
beings can remove. A -3 penalty to all saving
throws is otherwise permanent.

Rogue: When this card is drawn, one of the
character’s henchmen is totally alienated and for-
ever hostile. If the character has no henchmen,
the enmities of some powerful personage—com-
munity or religious—can be substituted. The
hatred remains secret until the time is ripe for
devastating effect.

Balance: As in “weighed in the balance and
found wanting,” the character must change to a
radically different alignment. Failure to act
according to the new alignment may bring penal-
ties (as described in the section on Character
Alignment, in the PHB). Discard this card.

Jester: The jester actually makes a pack more
beneficial if the experience point award is taken.
It is always discarded when drawn.

Fool: The payment and draw are mandatory.

Vizier: This card empowers the character
drawing it with the ability to call upon supernat-
ural wisdom to solve any single problem or
answer fully any question whenever he or she
requests it. Whether the information can be suc-
cessfully acted upon is another matter entirely.

Idiot: This card causes the loss of 1d4 points
of Intelligence immediately, drawing an addi-
tional card is optional.

Fates: This card enables the character to avoid
even an instantaneous occurrence if desired, for
the fabric of reality is unraveled and respun. Note
that it does not enable something to happen—it
can only stop something from happening. The
reversal is only for the character who drew the
card, and other party members may have to
endure the confrontation.

Donjon: This signifies imprisonment—either
by spell or by some creature, at the DM’s plea-
sure. All gear and spells are stripped from the vic-
tim in any case. Whether these items are
recoverable is up to the DM as well. Draw no
more cards.

DRAGON Magazine 77
Although the deck of many things in the AD&D
game is a powerful and interesting device, it is
but half a reflection (the other being ordinary
playing cards) of the original on which all such
card decks are based—the Tarot. The 78-card
Tarot deck consists of two parts. The Major
Arcana includes the card known as the Fool,
which is unnumbered, and the 21 numbered cards
I (The Magician) through XX] (The World); these
22 cards are also known as the Greater Trumps.
The Minor Arcana, or Lesser Trumps, are divided
into the four suits of Wands, Cups, Swords, and
Pentacles; each suit includes the “pip” cards (Ace
through Ten) and the court cards (Page, Knight,
Queen, and King).

The deck itself is a series of plaques or cards,
fashioned of precious and rare substances: ivory,
gold, vellum made from dragon skin, carved
bulette scales, or the like, painted with costly pig-
ments, gilded, or even jeweled. These are usually
wrapped in silk or other simple but costly cloth,
and placed within an elaborate box or coffer of at
least 5,000 gp value, expensively decorated with
symbols, and with the holy symbol of the deity
who is the master of the deck. It could be sold
unused for 39,000 gp plus the value of the box or
coffer, but if anyone does more than look at the
backs of the cards, they are compelled (saving
throw applicable) to draw from it.

A person who wishes or is compelled to draw

from the deck is allowed to announce an inten-
1,351

 

381

X
00: The Fool

tion to draw one, two, three, or four cards; when
the last member of the party who wishes to do
so has drawn, or if one hour elapses without any
draw, the deck disappears—unless the party is
on the plane of the Tarot’s master deity, which is
not the party’s own home plane. The person
making the draws, hereafter called the “drawer,”
should shuffle the cards well, in such a manner
that the images on almost one-half of the cards
are inverted or “reversed” in relation to the
others (which are termed “upright”). Each card
is then turned over along the long axis of the
card, and presented to the DM (from whose
viewpoint “upright” and “reversed” are judged).
After each person finishes drawing, the drawn
cards are returned to the deck, and it is reshuf-
fled by the next drawer. (In case the DM cannot
obtain a real Tarot deck, each card has been
given a number for the use of percentile dice; a
card will be reversed or upright on a 50%
chance, No card can be received more than
once by the same drawer.)

The effects of the Tarot are instantaneous
unless noted otherwise, and should be noted
immediately by the DM (silently); characters will
not notice any change until they perceive it in
terms of how it alters their abilities or activities.
The effects are irrevocable unless otherwise
stated, short of a wish for the Major Arcana, or a
limited wish for the Lesser Arcana.

If the effects of a card would raise or reduce an
ability score to a level outside racial limitations,
the DM can choose to effect change in another
ability if possible within those same limits, in this
order: Constitution, Charisma, Wisdom, Dexter-
ity, Intelligence, Strength. If a character loses one
point or more from an ability score and is there-
fore no longer qualified to be a member of the
class he or she was pursuing, then the character
loses the right to be in that class and (if not multi-
classed) must begin anew as a Ist-level character
in some other class. If the lost points are replaced
later by some other means, the character may
resume study in the class that he or she was
forced to abandon.

Above all, bear in mind that this is an artifact,
not the tool of a chaotic game for foolhardy or
suicidal characters; it should be handled with
respect and gravity. (Whether the random aspects
of the deck make its use an act of chaotic nature
is a matter decided between lawful characters,
their deities, and the DM.)

00: The Fool

The Fool is a quirky and variable character; he
may be clad in the fool’s cap and motley of a
jester (or joker), or in gorgeous, elaborate, and
costly (though not cumbersome) vestments. A
staff and pouch over his shoulder, a little dog
behind him, he strides blithely into the world. The
Fool is often seen dancing at the brink of the
precipice, for his is the folly (and the wisdom) of
childhood, the innocence of the babe and the mis-
chief of a child.

Upright, the Fool signifies unformed potential,
the need to make choices and the necessity of
making the right choice, the wisdom of fools and
the follies of the wise. Drawer gains one more
draw, but the new draw does not count unless the
card drawn is one with an effect that is mostly

good for the drawer.

01; The Magician

The Magician stands at a table on which are
various articles: swords, wands, pentacles,
cups, dice, balls, bells, or others. One hand
holds a double-ended wand toward the heavens,
the other points to the earth; over his head is a
lemniscate curve, the symbol of eternity and
infinity, The table, which resembles an altar, is
surrounded by growing things. Represented
here is the rational mind, confident in its power
and right to use the forces of the infinite to
reshape the world of matter.

Upright, The Magician signifies will, mastery,
the ability to manipulate the universe through
rational thought, self-confidence, ability to
manipulate others. Drawer gains one point of
Intelligence, two points if a mage or specialty
wizard,

Reversed, this card signifies ineptitude, failure
of will, indecision; abuse of power; disquiet;
mental illness. Drawer loses one point of Intelli-
gence, two points if a mage or specialty wizard.

04: The Emperor

"(in

02: The High Priestess

The High Priestess sits enthroned in her temple,
dressed in flowing robes that obscure a scroll or a
book of secret laws and wisdom she holds
securely. She is the mother of wisdom, some-
times identified with Isis or Diana; the queen-
protector of hidden knowledge and occult
mysteries.

Upright, she signifies serene knowledge,
sagacity, intuition, foresight, inspiration, the
power of the inner mind to heal, create, enlighten,
and inform. Drawer gains one point of Wisdom,
two points if a cleric or priest.

Reversed, she signifies superficiality, conceit,
shallowness, a lack of depth, perception, or
understanding; an acceptance of external and
superficial “knowledge,” of trivialities. Drawer
loses one point of Wisdom, two points if a priest
or cleric; in the latter case, receives one new pro-

ficiency.

03: The Empress
Royal and matronly, the Empress sits enthroned
among rich fields, clad in opulent garments, and
crowned with a starry, open crown. Befitting her
position, she bears a scepter, for hers is the realm
of universal fecundity and wealth.

Upright, she signifies material wealth, produc-
tivity for farmers and creative workers, prof-
itability for merchants, practical application of
knowledge. The next time treasures are divided,
the drawer will receive some item which turns out
to be worth an extra 3d6(x1,000) gp; but even the
drawer will not notice until at least three days
later.

Reversed, she signifies poverty, sterility,
inability to produce; waste or dissipation of
resources. The next time treasures are divided,
the drawer will receive an item which proves to
be worthless (a seemingly magical mace which
actually has Nystul’s magic aura on it, ora
“ruby” which is actually cut glass, and so on) as
the largest part of a treasure share, but will not
notice for at least three days.

04: The Emperor
Regal and fatherly, the Emperor sits upon his
throne, with open spaces surrounding him for a
domain. He wears royal robes, and in his hands
bears a scepter and an orb of rulership, His crown
is simple but majestic. He is the active principle,

the ruler of the visible, material world through law.
1,356

 

383

X
05: The Hierophant

Upright, he signifies leadership, strength of
mind, dominance, law, control of natural drives,
stability, power, conviction, and protection. A
lawful drawer gains two points of Charisma; a
chaotic drawer must successfully save vs. poison
or suffer confusion for 2d4 months; a neutral
drawer is unaffected.

Reversed, he signifies immaturity, confusion or
loss of control, ineffectiveness, irrationality,
attempts to destroy one’s authority or rights.
Unless the drawer saves vs. death magic at -4
(-2 for neutrals, no penalty for chaotics), over the
next four days, the PC graduaily goes insane in
one of the following ways, becoming: manic-
depressive, schizoid, demented (dementia prae-
cox), or hebephrenic.

05: The Hierophant

Established in state within his temple, the Hiero-
phant is the embodiment of the church in the
world, the external pomp and ceremony of orga-
nized religion; his elaborate crown, ornate robes,
and scepter of power establish him as a hierarch
and a potentate. He is the link between deity and
worshiper, his is the role of mediator and medium.
As the High Priestess is mistress of the hidden
mysteries, the Hierophant is the master of exter-
nal, manifest religion, law, and morality, usually
depicted ministering to, or being attended by, two
lesser priests, upon whom he bestows a blessing.

Upright, the Hierophant signifies the outer
form of religion; social relations with the world;
ritualism; conformity, traditionalism and ortho-
doxy; retention of outmoded ideas and attitudes;
orderly hierarchies; mercy and forgiveness.
Drawer gains one point of Charisma (two points
if a lawful priest); priests also gain one point of
Intelligence. If drawer is a priest who belongs to
any organization with a hierarchical nature, reli-
gious or secular, which does not base rank solely
on levels of ability, he or she will be promoted
soon, in 5-25 (1d100+4 rounded up) days, after
returning from this adventure. The Hierophant
also serves as a remove curse spell for a drawer
who is in need of one.

Reversed, this card signifies overkindness,
weakness; unconventionality, openness to nov-
elty, unorthodoxy. Drawer gets a permanent -2
on saving throws against charm, suggestion, and
other mental attack forms involving force of will;
he or she also receives a permanent +4 on reac-
tion rolls to all persons and beings. If drawer is a

"liens tn nn EneeeeeneneneeenEEEieEnnnenennenteenelll

member of any hierarchic body (as described
above), within 5-25 (1d100+4 rounded up) days
of returning from the current adventure he or she
will be demoted for “ineffectuality” and “lack of
authority.” If drawer is a chaotic priest, one point
of Intelligence is gained.

 

 

 

 

06: The Lovers

A winged supernatural being hovers over a man
and a woman, behind each of whom flourishes a
different tree. The man looks at the woman, but
she, though open to him, looks up at the supernat-
ural messenger. The Lovers are emblematic of the
necessity for the conscious mind (“intelligence”)
to approach the supernatural and transcendent
through the unconscious (“wisdom”), for a har-
monious and loving life depends on the coopera-
tion of both parts of the mind. (In older decks the
Lovers are often shown as a young man standing
between two women; some different divinatory

meanings relate to this older symbolism.)
Upright, they signify attraction, amativeness,
love; difficulties overcome, tests and trials
passed. The drawer’s Charisma increases by one
point for every 6 points of Wisdom or Intelligence
(whichever is lower), rounding down; in addition,
the drawers reaction rolls increase 1% for each
point of Wisdom or Intelligence (whichever is
1,358

 

* 384 \
lower), toward all persons (now known or
encountered later) to whom she or he might be
romantically inclined (based on race, gender, and
other factors).

Reversed, they signify tests failed; fickleness,
unreliability, infidelity; a need to stabilize and
harmonize the self, the possibility of a wrong
choice. The drawer'’s Charisma is reduced by one
point for every 6 points by which Wisdom or Intel-
ligence (whichever is lower) falls short of 18,
rounding losses up; reaction rolls increase as
above, but based on whichever ability score is
higher, and if the drawer already has a loved
companion or spouse, the reaction roll toward
her or him is reduced by half the amount that
other reaction rolls are increased by (round
reduction up).

 

 

 

 

07: The Chariot
A youthful and triumphant figure (a conqueror
rather than a hereditary ruler) stands in a chariot,
covered over by a starry canopy and drawn by
two steeds (horses or sphinxes) of opposing col-
ors and pulling in somewhat opposing directions.
The charioteer bears a scepter of dominion, but
no reins; the Chariot must be controlled through
the dominion of the mind. Here is represented the
conqueror of the outer world, victorious yet not

09: The Hermit

ceases

truly in control of the fullness of reality.

Upright, the Chariot signifies triumph, suc-
cess, conquest over the physical plane (including
illness and one’s own weaknesses) by the rational
mind, intelligence rather than wisdom; also travel
in comfort, state visits. Drawer is cured of all dis-
eases, lycanthropy, deafness, blindness, curses,
charms, and the like of which she or he is a vic-
tim, and will be 15% less susceptible to them
from now on. Also, the drawer will be able to coax
an extra 3 MV out of any vehicle, mount, or other
mode of travel, as long as the drawer’s mind is
clear and free to concentrate.

Reversed, it signifies decadence, ill health,
restlessness, victory through foul means, dis-
putes, failure. Drawer, over the next seven days,
begins to manifest a severe and chronic disease,
which can only be cured by a potion made from
the brains of two different kinds of sphinxes. The
disease will not prove fatal for at least 49 days.

08: Strength

A calm and self-contained, yet clearly quite
human woman controls the jaws of a lion with her
bare hands. Strength is both hers and the lion’s.
They are not struggling, for she has already sub-
dued the beast, and they are now in a harmony of
opposites: Hers is the Strength of the mind at one
with itself; his is the Strength of passion and car-
nal needs, which are unable to withstand a con-
sciousness aware of its link with the infinite, and
must submit to its control.

Upright, the card signifies spiritual power
overcoming material power, the fortitude of the
self-aware mind; courage and magnanimity; the
triumph of love over hate. The drawer gains +4 to
saving throws against fear, charm, suggestion,
illusion and other mental attack forms involving
will force.

Reversed, this card signifies the dominance of
the material and physical, lack of faith and moral
force, failure of self-control, giving in to tempta-
tion, failure of will. Drawer suffers a 4 to saving
throws against the attack forms listed above.

09: The Hermit
A robed figure, the archetypal “Old Wise Man,”
the Hermit stands alone. He leans on a pilgrim’s
staff and holds up the lantern of wisdom, offering
light to those who are humble enough to seek it.
He illuminates the path to wisdom for those who

want to emerge from darkness.
1,361

 

385

Mi
10: The Wheel of Fortune

Upright, he signifies prudent counsel, receiv-
ing wisdom or instruction from one more knowl-
edgeable, guidance on the path to one’s goal;
circumspection and caution; a solitary nature.
Within nine days of returning home from this
adventure, drawer will meet a visiting priest of
his or her own faith and of a higher level, who
will offer religious instruction to the drawer, ‘for
the improvement of the mind,” with a warning
that the instruction will not be quick. After one
month of study (if the drawer accepts the offer;
this should be a decision of the player), the
drawer emerges with a 2 point increase in Wis-
dom, but a I point loss in Charisma. The priest
will then give the drawer a hint to the location of
a magical item, and depart for places unknown.

Reversed, the Hermit signifies immaturity,
folly, refusal to accept aging and growth. Drawer
loses one third of accumulated age, gains one
point of Charisma and loses two points of Wis-
dom. When the drawer next seeks to gain a level,
the process will be three times as long and expen-
sive as usual, because of his or her refusal to
heed the instructor.

10: The Wheel of Fortune

The Wheel of Fortune rotates eternally, bring-
ing the great to naught and the humble to power,
for a time. Descending (on the left) is an evil
creature (often identified with Typhon or Set);
ascending is a canine-headed being (often identi-
fied with Anubis, or Hermes Trismegistus); yet
with another turn of the Wheel, the ascendant
will descend and the descendant will ascend.
Resting atop the Wheel (yet undisturbed by its
rotations) is a sphinx casually holding a weapon,
emblematic of the equilibrium which the enlight-
ened mind manifests even in the midst of for-
tune’s everchanging rounds. The sphinx, like the
four winged beings of the apocalypse which
occupy the corners of the field, is also a denial of
the apparent randomness of the universe, and of
the fatalism such false beliefs induce.

Upright, it signifies success, fortune, felicity,
an unexpected bit of luck, a change for the better.
Drawer gains a permanent +2 on all saving
throws; in addition, the next treasure discovered
by the party will include a magical item of not
less than 800 nor more than 8,000 experience
points in value, on which the arms, image, and
name of the drawer are ineradicably engraved or
otherwise incorporated, in such a way as to mark

“TiceaennynnnntnnnEOn REE EEE EEO

it as predestined only for that person. If the
drawer sells the item, both the card and the mate-
rials used to purchase it disintegrate, and the
drawer's saving-throw bonus is negated.

Reversed, it signifies unexpected bad fate, ill
luck, setbacks or interruptions in plans, unwanted
change. Drawer suffers a -2 penalty on all saving
throws; in addition, one magical item (at ran-
dom) belonging to the drawer disintegrates (this
does not apply if no magical items are currently
owned by the character).

 

11: Justice

Like the High Priestess and the Hierophant, Jus-
tice sits crowned and enthroned between pillars.
In her right hand she bears a two-edged sword, its
point toward the heavens; in her left hangs a set
of balances. Firm and resolute, hers is the power
of moral strength and integrity, of righteousness
(good) rather than rectitude (law).

Upright, she signifies justice, virtue, right
judgments, the triumph of the good, just rewards,
purity. Drawer of good alignment gains 8,000
experience points; drawer of evil alignment
loses 8,000 experience points or ‘4 of all experi-
ence points, whichever is the greater; neutral
drawer is unaffected. The DM may reduce these
gains or losses by up to 50% if the drawer has

1,363

 

386

hw
13: Death

eile ae

not been entirely consistent in following his or
her alignment.

Reversed, she signifies bias, injustice, exces-
sive severity; legal complications. Unless drawer
has been acting in very strict conformance with
his or her alignment (the DM should be very
rigid in this evaluation), she or he is stripped of
all property, effects, wealth, allegiance or loyal-
ties of followers (those over 50% base loyalty),
except for any nonmagical clothing worn; and all
but 4 of his or her experience points. Drawer will
also forget all spells received or memorized.

 

12: The Hanged Man

From a gibbet or a tau-cross of living wood, a
youth is suspended by one leg; his arms form a
triangle behind his back, and his free leg is placed
behind the bound one to form a cross (if viewed
upside down, he seems to be dancing a jig). He
represents Everyman, suspended by his own con-
sent as a pause and decision point in the creation
of an enlightened self. He is clearly in a contem-
plative state, not one of suffering, suspended
between the old life and the new; he must create
his new self knowingly and willingly.

Upright, he signifies a pause, or suspension of
ordinary activities; transcendence of material
temptation; surrender to the purification of the

self; spiritual wisdom, prophetic power; regenera-
tion. Drawer goes into a contemplative state for
24 days, in which he or she is open-eyed, can
walk (at an MV of 3), drink, and eat (lightly), but
will not fight or otherwise interact with the mun-
dane world; during this period the character also
regenerates as if wearing a ring of regeneration.
At the end of this period, the drawer loses one
point of Strength, but gains 2 points of Wisdom.
For a year and a day after that, the drawer will
refuse all wealth, whether earned or offered,
except that necessary for his or her own modest
needs and those of any henchmen.

Reversed, The Hanged Man signifies absorp-
tion in the ego and material matters, unwilling-
ness to sacrifice; false prophecies. Drawer goes
into a trance as described above, but “snaps out
of it” after 1d20+5 rounds, having lost 2 points
of Wisdom, but gained I point of Charisma. The
Drawer will seem to show a new ability to
prophesy the contents of rooms, intentions of
strangers, etc., but after five such detailed, cor-
rect “visions,” the supposed new ability will go
tragically awry, and completely vanishes after
being discredited.

13: Death
Death, represented as a skeleton, regards a deso-
late plain strewn with his victims, who are of all
ages and conditions, for Death has no favorites.
He is sometimes shown wielding a scythe, some-
times “terrible with banners.”

Upright, he symbolizes transit to the next stage
of being, transformation; abrupt and unexpected
change of the old self (not usually physical
death), the end of security and old situations and
the beginning of a new kind of life. The drawer
dies. Body and effects burst into flames (which do
10d10 points of damage if a character is foolish
enough to go into them), after 1d8 rounds the
flames die down and the character steps from the
ashes, reborn according to the following table:

Roll Race Roll Race
Ol-02.—s Bugbear = 31-36 Halfling
03-08 Dwarf 37-42 Half-orc
09-14 —s Elf 43-44 Hobgoblin
15-16 ~— Gnoll 45-94 Human
17-22, Gnome 95-96 Kobold
23-24 Goblin 97-98 Orc
25-30 = Half-elf 99-00 Ogre

1,365

 

387
14: Temperance

Note: A very good or very evil person will not be
reborn as a creature whose alignment is the
opposite. Regardless of the form in which the
character is reincarnated, allow the new form to
progress as far as possible in characteristics and
abilities. Someone reborn as a gnoll might even-
tually gain Hit Dice up to 3, 4, or even 5, plus
bonus points for a high Constitution; the charac-
ter would be eligible to wear armor, could use
magical items available to fighters, and would
have the intelligence level of its former incarna-
tion (or racial minimum). If the new form is of a
player character race, the character must be gen-
erated as a new character; the new form may be a
member of any player character class for which
he or she is eligible, except the old character's
former class (unless that is the only possible
choice), is of Ist-level, with no experience points.

Reversed, Death signifies stagnation, mere
existence, inertia or immobility, lethargy, sleep,
petrification. Drawer falls under a permanent
slow spell and receives no experience points for
this adventure (while slowed, drawer will age at
half the normal rate).

14: Temperance

A solemn, angelic figure, a flower or sun emblem
on its forehead, pours a fluid from one of a pair of
different-colored chalices to the other; behind the
figure are growing plants, and distant hills. The
card represents the inner self, enabling one to bal-
ance the forces of the mind, to illuminate intelli-
gence by wisdom and to clarify wisdom with
intelligence.

Upright, it signifies control of self, adaptation,
tempering of extremes; harmonious and fruitful
combinations, wise management of resources;
cooperation. Drawer will gain two points of Intel-
ligence or Wisdom (whichever of the two is
presently lower) but will lose one point in
whichever of the two is higher. If the two scores
are equal, the drawer gains one point in
whichever other characteristic is lowest, with ties
settled by player preference, Also, the drawer
never again injures a companion through care-
lessness, ill timing, bad luck, or similar circum-
Stance,

Reversed, this card signifies discord, hostility,
failure to communicate, conflicts of interests,
unfortunate combinations. Drawer gains one
point in whatever characteristic is most useful for
his or her class (priests and druids gain Wisdom;

scenes anette earseninanscememee en ranemremmnamssmmmsrermmmmeile

fighters, paladins, and rangers gain Strength;
mages gain Intelligence; thieves and monks gain
Dexterity; and bards gain Charisma), but loses
two points from whichever of his characteristics
is the lowest. If there is a tie for lowest, the loss is
taken from the lowest characteristic that the DM
judges to be most generally useful for the drawer’
class. In addition, from now on the drawer will
have a reaction roll adjustment of from -2% to -3
(50% chance for either) to ail persons.

 

 

 

 

15: The Fiend

Bat-winged, horned, donkey-eared, with hairy
legs and eagie’s feet, the Fiend stands or squats
upon a blocky pedestal (which sometimes resem-
bles an altar, sometimes an anvil). His right hand
gives a cryptic salute; in his left is a weapon held
in a bizarrely useless manner (a sword held by the
blade, a torch which is upside down or burnt out).
Connected by ropes to the altar are two figures
(usually a man and a woman), mostly human but
with certain animal characteristics such as horns
and tails; they are much smaller than the Fiend,

and appear strangely serene about their bondage.
Upright, the card signifies the bondage of
human nature to its own lowest needs and
impulses, desires of greed and domination, sensa-
tion without understanding; fatality, disaster, vio-
1,367

lence; weird and destructive experiences; evil
influences. Drawer is attacked by the Fiend of the
Tarot (see below).

Reversed, it signifies release from bondage to
the material; conquest of pride and greed; the
first steps toward spiritual enlightenment; free-
dom. Drawer gains one point of Wisdom and is
freed of all charms, suggestions, and other spells
subjecting the character to the will of another; he
or she gives away all nonessential possessions at
the end of this expedition (clothing and jewelry
items of less than 500 gp value may be given to
player characters or NPCs; the rest going to reli-
gion and charity).

The tarot fiend appears as shown on the deck
being used except that it has the face and gender
of the drawer. It has the Armor Class, Hit Points,
THACO rolls, weapons and magic items, Intelli-
gence, and size of the drawer as well. If the
drawer fails to save vs. death magic, he or she is
surprised by the fiend, for as many rounds as the
saving throw was short. The fiend fights with a
claw/claw/horn/horn routine, and if it scores two
claw hits during a single round of melee it will

also rake with its foot claws in that round for 1d4
points each. When either the drawer or the fiend
is slain, the fiend disappears with all of its
effects, but the drawer receives 15,000 experience
points. If the drawer is killed in this combat, the
experience point gain is applied to the character’s
total if and when the drawer is raised from the
dead.

16: The Tower

A tall square Tower topped with a crown is
being struck by lightning, which topples the
crown but leaves the tower standing. Hurtling
(from its windows; it has no doors) earthward are
two persons (presumably a man and a woman) in
rich garments, along with showers of sparks and
debris; they are stunned to see their Tower of iso-
lation and pride broken open by a stroke of fire
from the heavens.

Upright, the Tower signifies the overthrow of
existing notions, the fall of pride; sudden and
unexpected change; a perceived catastrophe
which may bring enlightenment in its wake; the
destruction of false concepts and ideas. Drawer
loses one level (from the most advanced if a mul-
ticlassed character of uneven levels, choose ran-
domly if equal; Ist-level drawer has experience
points reduced to zero), loses all magic items and
wealth, but drawer gains +1 to saving throws in a
column of player's choice.

Reversed, it signifies the same to a lesser
degree; but also oppression, false imprisonment
or accusations; living in a rut, inability to effect
worthwhile change, being stuck in an unhappy
situation. Drawer loses one level (as above); also,
for a year and a day he or she is unable to gain a
new level, regardless of experience poinis accu-
mulated.

17: The Star

A vast, flamboyant Star of eight points is sur-
rounded by seven similar stars. In the foreground,
a young woman rests one foot on land and one
upon the waters, as from two identical jugs she
pours the Water of Life both upon the land and
into the larger body of water. Behind her is rising
ground and a tree with a bird in it; in the distance
are mountains.

Upright, the Star represents inspiration freely
flowing, the gifts of the spirit, the fruits of medi-
tation, understanding, hope; good health and

pleasure; granting of wishes. The next time the
1,369

 

389

MS
18: The Moon

drawer, after having earned enough experience
points to advance to the next level, spends an
hour or more under a clear and starlit sky, he or
she will feel inspiration pour down from the very
stars, and find that the next level has been gained
without formal tutoring. Drawer also gains a +2
to saving throws vs. mental illness.

Reversed, this card signifies pessimism, doubt;
chance of illness; arrogance, haughtiness, stub-
bornness; lack of perception. Drawer becomes so
smug, arrogant, and skeptical a pupil, he or she
requires twice the usual amount of tutoring
before any new level can be obtained. This change
is permanent,

18: The Moon

The crescent Moon radiates its deceptive bright-
ness upon a dim and foreboding landscape. In the
pool which fills the foreground lurks a crayfish
(or other creature from the abyss); beyond this,
two dogs (or a dog and a wolf) bark and how] at
the Moon, which sheds a cryptic dew upon them.
In the background are two towers, and a path
leads from the pool to the goal beyond the towers.

Upright, this card signifies the “dark night of
the soul”: trickery, deception, secret foes; unfore-

seen perils; bad luck for a loved one; danger, -

darkness, terror, occult forces; danger of falling

”" pienscnesennnieineeneemnecteenseeenessinsemnnnaninneneneenetetinmmmmmnemmmmmcmmell

into a trap or being misled, great danger of mak-
ing an error. Drawer must make a saving throw
vs. death magic or fall prey to lunacy at the next
full moon. If the save is made, drawer must then
save vs. polymorph or succumb to lycanthropy
(as a werewolf) upon the next full moon. If both
saves are made, a henchman or servitor (at ran-
dom) becomes disloyal over the next five turns
(reduce loyalty and reaction rolls by I1d6+4).

Reversed, the Moon signifies peace gained at a
cost; instability; lesser degrees of deception or
betrayal, trifling errors. The best magic item in
the possession of the drawer is permanently
drained of ail magical properties; if drawer has
no magic, 20% of all experience points earned on
this adventure are lost.

19; The Sun

The Sun in its splendor shines benevolently
down, either upon a pair of children playing
blithely and simply together, or upon a single
child riding a white horse and waving a scarlet
banner. The innocent children (pair or single) are
playing in front of a walled-in garden which they
have left behind.

Upright, it signifies happiness, success, con-
tentment (particularly in marriage); achievements
and studies completed, liberation to enjoy the
simple pleasures; devotion, friendship. Drawer
receives enough experience points to reach the
next level, but not more than 19,000 in any case.
Also, drawer has a +1 reaction roll to all persons
met later or known presently, and they have a +1
reaction to the drawer.

Reversed, this card signifies unhappiness, lone-
liness; plans and triumphs delayed; broken friend-
ships or engagements; possible loss of a job or
home. Drawer loses all henchmen and servitors
after returning from this expedition (they leave
town, take another leader, or otherwise leave for
“personal reasons” but do not become hostile). If
drawer is a henchman or vassal of another, he or
she is dismissed, or stripped of offices, unless a
saving throw vs. death magic is successful. Also,
the drawer is stripped of enough experience points
to be reduced to the bottom of his or her present
level, but not more than 9,500 in any case.

20: Judgment
An angel sounds forth the call to Judgment from
a trumpet to which is attached a banner bearing a

cross; the clouds from which it emerges radiate
1,372

power. Below, a figure rises from a tomb while on
each side a man and woman also rise; all these
figures are as one in the wonder, adoration, and
ecstatic awe which their whole bodies express as
they answer the summons.

Upright, this card signifies rebirth, renewal,
awakening; rejuvenation, change of personal con-
sciousness; a life well lived and a work well done;
atonement, judgment, the need to forgive and to
seek forgiveness, sincere self-appraisal. Drawer
becomes a young adult over the course of the next
hour (if not one already) but without any changes
in characteristics. To determine exact age, select
a young-adult age randomly, then add half the
difference between that age and maximum young-
adult age, rounding down. If drawer is already a
young adult, he or she will become 90% of the
minimum young-adult age. If the drawers behav-
ior is judged by the DM to have been strictly con-
sistent with the characters alignment and religion
(observance of taboos, donations, etc.), 2d6 hit
points, determined randomly, are also gained.
The gain can only be up to the maximum possible
number of hit points for that character.

Reversed, it signifies weakness; stupidity; a
sentencing; disillusionment, disappointment;
indecision leading to procrastination and delay.
Drawer is affected as if struck by a ray of enfee-
blement from a mage 3rd-level or of the same
level as the drawer (whichever is higher); the
drawer is also henceforth subject to a penalty of
-1 on initiative rolls, due to her or his inability to
choose between alternatives.

21: The World

Surrounding by an elliptical wreath of living
foliage is a female figure dancing joyously, a
short wand in each hand. In the four corners of
the card are the heads of the four beings of the
apocalypse, hovering protectively outside the
wreath. Her legs form a cross, as do those of the
Hanged Man, but she stands upright, supported
by the ether, the very fabric of the World; her
dance is of the sensitive life, of joy attained in the
body, of the soul’s intoxication in a World-turned-
paradise.

Upright, the World signifies completion, suc-
cess, triumph in all things, perfection, fulfill-
ment; the path of liberation and enlightenment;
the admiration of others. Drawer gains one point
to each ability score that is two or more below
racial maximum.

22: Ace of Wands

Tce tent capers

Reversed, this card signifies imperfection, fail-
ure, lack of vision, failure to complete task; fear of
change or travel, fixity, permanence, stagnation.
After 1d4 days, drawer begins to develop an
increasing distrust of strange places: other cities
or countries, dungeons, wildernesses, new taverns,
all places. Within an additional 2d4 days this
becomes full-blown paranoia, with drawer believ-
ing that everyone and everything outside his or her
home (eventually, there too) is out to get him or
her, and that any so-called “friend” or “loved
one” who tries to get the drawer to come out into
the world is clearly part of the conspiracy.

THE MINOR ARCANA

Wands
Wands generally represent enterprise and growth,
progress, advancement, animation, inventiveness,
intelligence, and energy. This is the suit of the
mage, and of the laborer.

 

 

 

 

22: Ace of Wands
A hand issuing from clouds grasps a still-verdant
branch in the shape of a wand. In the background
may be a city or castle on a hill.
Upright, it signifies creation, beginning (of an
adventure, a journey, or an endeavor), invention,
1,374

 

391

Ms
23: Two of Wands

enterprise. Drawer (affected automatically) and
certain party members (those who fail to save vs.
spell at -2) are freed from all existing geas, quest
spells, and charms, and placed under a compul-
sion (equivalent to a combined geas and quest) to
kill a single monster of 7,000 XP value (or a sin-
gle group of monsters of 21,000 XP value) or
more. Fulfillment of the task gains each partici-
pant an additional 1,000 XP. in addition to the XP
reward for the monster.

Reversed, the Ace of Wands signifies false
starts, clouded joy, ruin, decadence, cancellation
of projects, failure, and retreat. Effects as above,
but the compulsion is to cancel the expedition
and return to base as quickly as practical. While
returning to home or headquarters, the party has
-2 to Armor Class (two places better) and +2 to
saving throws, but receives no experience points
for actions performed during this retreat.

23: Two of Wands
A majestic figure wearing princely headgear
regards the broad world from a height. He holds
one wand, and regards a globe; another wand is
nearby.

Upright, this card signifies boldness, courage,
rule over others; and also the anguish and sorrow
that may accompany power. Drawer gains one
point of Charisma; and if he or she is in danger
of going insane, that possibility is increased by
(a 4 in 10 chance becomes 5 in 10) anytime dur-
ing the next year; the insanity will take the form
of melancholia.

Reversed, the Two of Wands signifies trouble,
fear, sadness, surprise. Drawer'’s saving throws
against fear and hopelessness are reduced by 1.

24: Three of Wands
A calm personage, back turned, leans lightly
upon one of three wands planted in the ground,
and looks out across a sea, beyond which are
mountains.

Upright, this card signifies established
strength, wealth, enterprise, discovery, partner-
ship in undertakings. When the drawer next seeks
to go on an expedition or adventure, a nonplayer
character of 1d3 levels higher will offer to come
along, and to loan equipment and supplies. (This
should be an established NPC already friendly to
the drawer.)

Reversed, the Three of Wands signifies cessa-
tion of adversity, an end to or suspension of diffi-

(i

culties; assistance with an ulterior motive. Effects
as above, but the NPC will be planning to trick or
betray the drawer. This could be by stealing a
magic item from the drawer, robbing and strand-
ing the character on an island, or other misad-
venture; generally (80%), the betrayal is not
meant to be fatal.

25: Four of Wands
Four great wands are garlanded with chains of
flowers, two women bear flowers, and behind
them is a bridge over a moat, leading to a castle
or manor.

Upright, the Four of Wands signifies repose,
peace, rural refuge, country domesticity and
felicity. When drawer returns from this expedition
to home or headquarters, after healing is fin-
ished, the character feels a strong desire to rest a
while at home; for every month of rest thereafter
up to four months, the drawer (unknowingly)
receives 1,000 XP. The desire may be resisted
(roll for saving throw vs. spell, at -2, not more
than once a week), but can continue beyond the
four-month period.

Reversed, the meaning is the same but less
intense. Effects as above, but only 500 XP are
given per month, and saving throws to resist the
desire are at -1.

26: Five of Wands

Five youths are apparently battling with huge
wands, yet there is no sign of actual bodily injury.

Upright, it signifies competition, strife, differ-
ences of opinion, nonfatal struggle. The effects of
discord (as per the symbol) will befall the
drawer'’s party after 1d4+3 turns; grappling and
other nonlethal combat techniques will be used,
but serious injuries are nonetheless possible,

Reversed, the Five of Wands signifies victory
after surmounting obstacles, contradictions, or
trickery. Ali characters involved in the party 5 next
victorious combat receive double experience points
for the action; thieves in the party have a 10% bet-
ter success rate in thefis attempted upon their own
companions until the end of this adventure.

27: Six of Wands
A rider crowned with a laurel wreath bears a
wand adorned with a laurel wreath, and is accom-
panied by five staff-bearing figures on foot.
Upright, it signifies victory, triumph, good tid-
ings, the successful completion of a struggle.

31: Ten of Wands

Wi geet ete ipemeneeen apemrnerrtetreessenanremrerereeememenmmmmeely,

Drawer is doubly effective (double damage for
weapon-wielders) in attacks against the next foe;
mages’ spells are of three times’ normal duration,
and saving throws against such spells is now at -3.

Reversed, it signifies indefinite delay, disloy-
alty, the success of an enemy, fear. Drawers
learn upon returning from this adventure that
his or her most hated and feared opponent has
had a great success and is said to be intent upon
attacking the drawer soon. The opponent can be
anyone from a professional rival to an entire
tribe of orcs—anyone the drawer has defeated,
attacked, injured, or merely outshone. Even a
Ist-level character will have had a rival fellow
apprentice, a traditional family or clan enemy,
or something of the sort.

28; Seven of Wands
A youth brandishes a staff from the top of a hill,
and is confronted by six more wands in opposition.

Upright, this card symbolizes a stand against
unfavorable odds from an advantageous or supe-
rior position, the need to hold an unpopular stand
or defy seemingly unbeatable opposition. Jn the
next combat where drawer and party are outnum-
bered 2 to 1 or worse, the drawer's party has a
+4 on initiative rolls; and a bonus of +1 on sav-
ing throws and AC (one place better).

Reversed, it signifies indecision, ignorance,
perplexity, anxiety, embarrassment, doubt, hesi-
tancy. Drawer becomes indecisive; he or she has
a permanent —] on all initiative rolls for drawer
and any party he or she leads.

29: Eight of Wands
Eight wands fly through open space, but near the
end of their flight they will clearly fall to ground
soon.

Upright, it signifies swiftness, haste; that
which is moving; approach to goals; travel by air;
too rapid advancement. When next attacked,
drawer will be hasted for 2d4 turns, rest of party
for eight rounds; those who make their saving
throws vs. death magic will not suffer aging (the
drawer throw will be at -1).

Reversed, the Eight of Wands signifies delay,
stagnation; quarrels and disputes. When next
attached, the entire party is slowed for 1d8+8
rounds, afterward, those who do not save vs.
spell suffer discord (as with the symbol), but they
will not attack with lethal weapons.

30: Nine of Wands
A sturdy, muscular figure, with a minor wound
(already bandaged) grasps or leans on one staff
and expectantly regards the surroundings. Behind
are eight other wands, arranged as for a palisade
or as a sturdy boundary.

Upright, this card signifies a pause in struggle,
strength to meet opposition, power in reserve,
discipline, preparation for an encounter, delay or
suspension. One time before the end of this
adventure, drawer and party will be able to
return to a designated sanctuary (as the priest
spell word of recall) for 9-12 turns. They may
bind their wounds, refresh themselves, and the
like, but may not pick up or drop anything, nor
communicate with anyone. At the end of the dura-
tion, they will reappear at the time and place they
left from, in the same positions and carrying the
same equipment.

Reversed, the Nine of Wands signifies obstacles,
adversity, opposition, weakness, ill health, even
calamity. Drawers Strength is reduced to racial
minimum when next confronted by an opponent,
and remains reduced for eight more turns.

31: Ten of Wands
A weary figure stumbles toward a city or castle,
oppressed by the weight of ten wands he is carrying.

Upright, the Ten of Wands signifies oppression,
testing by work and pain; also force, energy, or
power misused and applied to selfish ends, the bur-
den of ill-controlled power. An employer, liege,
ruler, supervisor, or other person with power over
the drawer, will, in 2410 days, overwork and over-
burden the drawer. If the drawer bears up under the
stress (which will not be unendurable, merely irk-
some in the extreme) for 1d10 weeks, he or she will
be relieved of the oppression, and receive a reward
of 1,000_XP per week of suffering.

Reversed, it signifies loss, separation, immigra-
tion; intrigue. Drawer is teleported a distance of
1d4 levels in a dungeon setting, or 2d10 miles in a
city or wilderness setting, to a place he or she is not
familiar with at all. At least one party member will
urge that the rest of the party consider the drawer
deceased, and that the character's possessions (if
any) being carried by party members be considered
extra treasure for the “survivors.”

The Court Cards
The Court Cards of each suit (King, Queen,
Knight, and Page) signify a being who will aid or
1,383

 

393

X
 

32: Page of Wands

attack the drawer, depending on whether the card
is drawn upright or reversed. Each of these beings
is a material form of that which is symbolized by
the card (their appearance will be exactly that of
the person depicted on the card) rather than a nat-
ural being (human or otherwise); thus, they may
possess combinations of classes or other attrib-
utes which might be forbidden to player charac-
ters or NPCs. They will materialize the next time
the drawer is attacked by another creature or
character, and then engage in combat until the
combat is resolved by the defeat of one side or
the other, or by the successful evasion of one
party by the other, or until the card being is slain.
Upon resolution or death, the being dematerial-
izes along with all its effects. Stated Armor
Classes, damage figures, and the like, take
account of the magic with which these beings are
equipped, and of Dexterity or Strength bonuses.
All of the card creatures are neutral in alignment.

The Page is a fair youth with blond hair and light
eyes, who stands boldly holding a raised wand as
if ready to deliver a message or proclamation (the
Page is often a bearer of tidings, good or ill).

mander: so, therefore, is the King), which looks
like a small black lizard. The King of Wands is a
mature man, blond and fair with pale eyes.

Cups
Cups generally represent love, happiness, deep
feelings, gaiety, joy, and wisdom. They hold
water or wine, symbols of pleasure and happi-
ness, This is the suit of the priests and minstrels.

36: Ace of Cups
A large and ornate cup, usually shown accompa-
nied by flowers and other living creatures. The deck
shows the cup supported by a hand issuing from a
cloud; pouring from the cup are five streams flow-
ing into a body of water on which float water-lilies;
a white dove drops a wafer into the cup.

Upright, the Ace of Cups signifies joy, nourish-
ment, content; opulence, fulfillment, abundance;
joys of faith, “my cup runneth over,” fertility, pro-
ductiveness. This draw serves as atonement, cure
critical wounds, cure disease, dispel evil, dispel
magic, exorcize, or remove curse (any two of the
above needed by the drawer within the next 21
weeks) at the 16th level of ability.

Reversed, it signifies change, alteration, insta-
bility, bad faith, false love, erosion, inconsistency.
The next two spells from the list above cast upon
the drawer will be ineffective.

37: Two of Cups
A young man and woman share cups, perhaps in
pledge; above them is a caduceus, surmounted by
a winged lions-head.

Upright, this card signifies love or friendship
beginning or renewed; union; understanding,
cooperation, and partnership. Drawer will fall in
love with the member of the party most attractive
to her or him (based on Charisma, racial prefer-
ences, and other factors) over the next 24 hours;
drawer gains four points of Charisma at the same
time—in the eyes of the beloved only.

Reversed, the Two of Cups signifies misunder-
standing, crossed desires, violent passion, disap-
pointment in love, disunity. Drawer will fall
violently, passionately, in unrequited love with the
member of the party most attractive to her or him,
over the next 24 hours; drawer loses seven points of
Charisma—in the eyes of the beloved only.

38: Three of Cups
Three cups are lifted up, in a setting of flowers
and other growing things.
Upright, the Three of Cups signifies victorious
and happy conclusions, success, abundance, plea-
sure and hospitality, solace, fulfillment, and heal-

”"Olacsieeeeecseltmenieti etic ai penieilmemienemeell

ing. Before the drawer appear three large cups or
chalices (which are wooden, but resemble those
on the card), on which are carved the drawer’s
name. In each of these the drawer can create food
and water, / cubic foot of either, 7 times, after
which they become simple cups worth 2 gold
pieces each. If the drawer is a priest, each cup
will work 21 times. These items are not salable
for more than the 2 gp, since the spell only works
Jor the drawer, and only if all three are together;
their experience point value is 1,000 for the set,
3,000 for a priest.

Reversed, it signifies achievement; ending;
overindulgence in drink and the pleasures of the
senses; excess. Drawer becomes more susceptible
to intoxication from alcohol: slight intoxication
(normally) becomes moderate, moderate becomes
great, great becomes “beyond great.” This change
will first become evident after the end of the cur-
rent adventure.

 

39: Four of Cups

A youth sits contemplatively on the grass beneath
a tree. A hand from a mysterious cloud offers a
cup; but the youth seemingly ignores both it and

the three other cups upon the ground nearby.
Upright, it signifies weariness, surfeit, disgust
with earthly pleasures and things of this world,
1,391

X
boredom and discontent, a reevaluation of
lifestyle. Drawer will decline any nourishment
but water for the next seven days (“to clear the
mind and system”); at the end of this adventure,
drawer will give all food and drink and 10% of
his or her wealth to the poor, and half the gains
from this adventure to his or her faith (100% if a
priest, druid, or paladin). These donations will
go to public institutions, not to player characters
or NPCs. The drawer then withdraws from the
active world for 4 weeks + 4d4 days, emerging
only for religious services that cannot be per-
jormed at home.

Reversed, the Four of Cups signifies novelty;
reawakening to new goals, new relationships, or
new ambitions; refreshment. Drawer breaks free
of any charm, insanity, beguilement, or the like
that afflicts him or her. Drawer will move afoot at
an extra 3 MV for 4d4 weeks, and gains a bonus
of 25% on all experience points earned for the
rest of this adventure.

40: Five of Cups
A gloomy, cloaked figure in a hilly setting looks
sideways at three spilled and fallen cups; two full
ones stand behind. In the background is a body of
water.

Upright, this symbolizes partial loss, failure to
come up to expectations, disappointment or disil-
lusionment, dissolution of a friendship or mar-
riage. Drawer loses the affections of a current
lover or, if none, those of a henchman to whom
drawer might be attracted (they do not become
hostile, merely indifferent) over the next five
days; drawer’s morale and reaction rolls will be
at -1 for 1d20+5 weeks.

Reversed, it signifies return of pleasure, of an
old friend or loved one, a new partnership or
alliance. Drawer gains or regains an old lover or
henchman to whom drawer might be attracted,
within five days of returning from this adventure
or expedition; drawers morale and reaction rolls
will be at +1 for 1d20+5 weeks after this.

41: Six of Cups

. Two young children stand in a garden or village

green, playing with one of six cups filled with
flowers; the ambience is bucolic and nostalgic.
Upright, it signifies remembrance of things
past, the joys and happiness of days gone by.
Drawer sees a clear vision of a beloved friend
and companion of days gone by (one who is still

oy 40: Five of Cups cr

alive). Within I1d8 days of the drawer'’s return
from this adventure, a parcel arrives from the
old friend, passed on by an obliging merchant
or other appropriate courier. In addition to a
letter of reminiscences, the parcel will include
either a gem of 4,000 gp value or less (49%), an
item of jewelry of 4,000 gp value or less (40%),
or a minor (gp and XP values of 4,000 or less)
miscellaneous magical item usable by the
drawer (11%).

Reversed, it signifies renewal, thoughts of the
future, that which is to come. Drawer has a clear
vision of the next being or group of beings the —
party is to encounter after they have finished with
the Tarot (although not the meaning of the vision,
of course).

42. Seven of Cups
A startled figure is confronted by seven cups
overflowing with fantastic visions: castles,
dragons, jewels, and other sights more bizarre.

Upright, it signifies daydreaming, dissipation,
wishful thinking, ephemeral or illusory success.
Drawer has a -2 penalty on saving throws vs.
illusions from now on.

Reversed, it signifies resolution, determina-
tion, strength of will, intelligent choice. Drawer
will save at +2 vs. illusions from now on; illusion
specialists will gain one level instead.

43: Eight of Cups

A dejected figure with a pilgrim’s staff leaves
eight neatly stacked cups behind and trudges up a
barren moonlit mountain into the distance.

Upright, the Eight of Cups signifies abandon-
ment of success, disappointment in material
gains, the discarding of what has been achieved
for a higher goal; journeying from place to place.
Over the remainder of this expedition drawer will
feel an increasing discontent and an increase in
religious interests. Within eight days of returning
home from this adventure, the character will sell
all nonportable properties, abdicate (or at least
take leave from) all official positions, and enter a
religious retreat for 4d8 weeks (after donating
half of all worldly goods to the faith). If drawer is
eligible, he or she becomes a priest, druid, or
paladin of his or her deity (allowing for align-
ment, gender, and racial requirements, and the
restrictions listed in the PHB). Priests, druids,
and paladins will stay in religious retreat for a

year and a day, emerging with 4,000 additional
1,395

 

4 396 “
experience points. Those who fall into neither of
these classifications emerge from retreat with
renewed spirituality and 1,000 extra experience
points.

Reversed, this card signifies feasting, joy, striv-
ing for material success, gaiety, a less spiritual
outlook. While healing and resting after the end
of this expedition, drawer will become increas-
ingly restive and frivolous. As soon as it is safe to
do so, he or she will spend at least 8% of total
wealth on a feast or series of feasts and carousals,
stopping only after money starts running low or a
daily saving throw vs. death magic (at -2) is suc-
cessful. Depending on alignment, deity, and pro-
Jession, this debauchery may require atonement
by the drawer.

44: Nine of Cups
A prosperous figure, having feasted happily, rests
before a counter on which nine cups, generously
filled, have been neatly arranged.

Upright, the Nine of Cups signifies success,
satisfaction, all the good things of life, well
being, the granting of wishes. Drawer gains one
immediate wish, which can only be used for phys-
ical or material matters (thus, it could be used to
restore hit points, but not to raise an Intelligence
Score).

Reversed, it signifies misplaced confidence,
false assurance, material loss, imperfections, mis-
takes, disputes, failure to fulfill a wish. Effects as
above, but the wish will go wrong in one of various
ways; thus, a wish to bring a character back to life
might result in the deceased becoming a zombie
(as the spell animate dead), or a wish to transport
the party into the fortress of an enemy might trans-
port them into the cells of the dungeon, without
keys. The mistake or flaw may be disastrous, but
should not be fatal in and of itself.

45: Ten of Cups
Ten cups in a rainbow appear as in a vision;
beneath it a couple raises their arms in joy and
ecstasy and two children dance together blithely;
a home stands in the background.

Upright, it signifies contentment, repose of the
heart, perfection of love and friendship, peace.
Reaction and loyalty scores of the drawer'’s
friends and associates increase by +4.

Reversed, it signifies betrayal, loss of friend-
ship, waste, criminal behavior strife, hatred,
resentment. Reaction and loyalty scores of the

~ 48: Queen of Cups _-

drawer '’s friends and associates decrease by 's of
their present amount (round losses up), but at
least -2 in any case.

46: Page of Cups
A fancily dressed youth of medium coloration,
the Page stands lightly, contemplating the fish or
other curious images emerging from the Cup
being carried.

Page of Cups: 3rd-level priest (AC 4, hp 24, AT

The Cup is his holy symbol.

47: Knight of Cups
Stately but not martial, the Knight carries his Cup
firmly as he approaches a stream. He wears plate
armor and a winged helmet; he is a young man,
of medium coloring.

Knight of Cups: 4th/4th-level priest/fighter (AC
1, hp 42, AT 1, Dmg by weapon type); has plate
mail and a cloak of displacement. His spells are
cause fear, cure light wounds, light, chant, and
hold person. The Cup is his holy symbol. If the
setting is suitable (plains, highway, a glade) the
Knight is riding a medium war horse (18 hp) with
horseshoes of the zephyr.

48: Queen of Cups
Beautiful and dreamy, the Queen contemplates an
extremely elaborate cup; she is quite capable of
turning those dreams into actions. She is of
medium coloring.

Queen of Cups: 7th-level priest (AC 7, hp 56, AT
1, Dmg 1d6+1 or 1d6+3); wears a ring of protec-
tion +] and a cloak of protection +2 and carries a
scepter that also acts as a mace +3. The spells the
queen can cast include: command, sanctuary,
cure light wounds, hold person (x2), silence 15'
radius, animate dead, dispel magic, cure serious
wounds. The Cup is her holy symbol.

coloring, he is a fair and lively minded man.

King of Cups: 7th-level priest (AC 2, hp 56, AT

(AC 5) and a ring of protection +3; and his Cup is
also a decanter of endless water. His spells are
cure light wounds, light, sanctuary, hold person,

Swords
Swords generally represent courage boldness,
violence, force, strength, authority, aggression,
ambition, activity, accomplishment of goals (for
good or ill); sometimes misfortune and disaster.
This is the suit of fighters, of kings, and rulers.

50: Ace of Swords
Issuing from a cloud, a hand grasps an upright
sword, topped by a crown from which hang
branches of olive and laurel.

Upright, it signifies conquest, the triumph of
brute force, championship, excessive use of
power. Drawer will hit the next opponent in phys-
ical combat on every attempt (unless 21 or better

 

apuinsiesnialiaiienniaemmenmemmemesiieintal

is required to hit); but cannot strike to subdue
that opponent.

Reversed, it signifies debacle, disaster, lack of
productivity, Pyrrhic victory. The next time
drawer hits an opponent in physical combat, his
or her weapon will do 2d4 plus the normal points
of damage but then shatters irreparably. If the
blow is with a body part, said part will suffer a
severe break, requiring a heal spell and four
weeks of immobility to become useful again. This
applies even if the drawer was attempting to
strike to subdue.

51: Two of Swords
A blindfolded female figure balances two swords
upon her shoulders beneath a new moon; behind
her is a turbulent or rocky sea.

Upright, the Two of Swords signifies balance
of forces, expedience, conformity, alliance of
arms, indecision or tension in relationships, stale-
mate, harmony, concord, affection. Loyalty and
reaction rolls of friends, henchmen, and servitors
change Id6 points toward 12, going up or down
as appropriate, over the next two turns.

Reversed, it signifies treachery, disloyalty,
duplicity, release, movement of affairs in the
wrong direction. Loyalty and reaction rolls of
friends, henchmen, and servitors will change 1d6
points toward 4, going up or déwn as appropri-
ate, over the next two turns.

52: Three of Swords
Against a turbulent background, a heart is pierced
by three swords.

Upright, this card signifies division, quarrel-
ing, separation, upheaval, civil war or political
struggle, arguments. Those members of the party
who do not make successful saving throws vs.
spell (at -3) start a violent fight within the party
in the next 1d4 turns; the drawer does not get a
saving throw. The basis of the fight may be philo-
sophical, racial, political, or religious. Those
quarreling cannot be stopped (except forcefully,
by those who made the saving throw) until at
least one party member is unconscious or dead.

Reversed, it has much the same meaning but to a
lesser degree. Effects as above, but saving throws
will be at +1, and those party members with a Wis-
dom of more than seven will be using nonlethal
combat methods. (Note: In both these cases the
effects of the card wear off in 1d4+3 hours, but the

animosities created or revealed may linger.)

§3: Four of Swords
The image of a warrior lies upon a tomb or altar;
alongside it is one sword, and three more hang in
the background.

Upright, the Four of Swords symbolizes repose,
release, hermit’s retreat, solitude, exile, replenish-
ment (not death). After this adventure is com-
pleted, drawer will refrain from adventure and
excitement for an extra four weeks plus 1d4 days
after healing and other recovery are completed,
regardless of inducements offered. The period of
repose will be spent in solitary study and medita-
tion, at the end of which the drawer rolls 4d4; if
the resulting number is less than the drawer'’s
Wisdom, he or she gains one hit point perma-
nently, or two in the case of fighters (including
paladins and rangers).

Reversed, this card signifies circumspection,
precautions, a need for careful administration,
economy, prudent action. Drawer gains a perma-
nent 10% increase in the chance of success of
precautionary measures (listening at doors,
attempting to detect evil/good, casting augury,
and the like); but if the drawer is careless, the
chance for him or her to be surprised is 2 in 6
greater. Thus, an elven drawer listening at a door
behind which a band of orcs lurk will have a 5 in
20 (instead of 3 in 20) chance of hearing noise; a

55: Six of Swords

i

drawer checking an alley for danger with a
medallion of ESP will suffer a malfunction on a 2
in 30 (rather than 5 in 30) chance, and so on; but
a drawer who blithely enters a presumably empty
woods without drawing weapons and taking simi-
lar prudent measures will be surprised on a 5 in 6
(instead of 3 in 6) chance by the enemy therein.

54: Five of Swords
A scornful youth watches as two dejected figures
slouch away; two swords lie on the ground, two
more are slung over the youth’s shoulder, and he
holds the fifth pointed toward the ground. The
sky is clouded and stormy.

Upright, this card signifies defeat, dishonor,
loss, degradation, infamy, destruction, conquest,
cruelty, failure. /n their next conflict with beings
not evil in alignment, drawer and party will be
defeated and surrender rather than be slain. They
are stripped of weapons, valuables, and sup-
plies—ano lives are lost.

Reversed, it signifies more or less the same,
plus sorrow, weakness, funerals, loss of a friend.
Effects as above, but the drawer suffers some
form of humiliation or injury, possibly including
the slaying of a familiar, henchman, or servitor.

55: Six of Swords
A ferry keeper conveys solemn passengers to a
further shore across calm waters. Six swords
stand hilt-up along the edge of the boat.

Upright, it signifies a departure, breaking
away, travel, success after anxiety, voluntary
separation, water journey. The next effort by
drawer and party to flee, avoid, or evade oppo-
sition that would normally fail, will succeed,
unless the chance for success was zero (but also
even then, if there is a body of water between
the party and the pursuers). Drawer has a per-
manent 5% bonus chance of evading pursuit, if
he or she can cross a body of water ahead of the
pursuers.

Reversed, it signifies outcry, lack of immediate
solution, staying in place. The next time the
drawer and party seek to flee, avoid, or evade,
they fail badly because of slow speed, an involun-
tary outcry that alerts the opponents, or the
inability to get across a body of water. Drawer
also becomes permanently sensitive (-1 on sav-
ing throw) to attack forms based on loud sounds
or outcries.

56: Seven of Swords

56: Seven of Swords
A scurrying figure rushes away with five swords,
while two other swords are left behind.

Upright, it signifies partial success, a plan that
may fail, plots and schemes, tricky endeavors.
The next encounter in which the drawer takes
part will be a partial success: some opponents
will escape with part of the treasures, valuables
will be damaged in the fighting, other, similar,
mishaps will occur. Any attempt to make the
encounter more nearly a total success will bring
the whole effort to ruin ( while sacking up the last
copper pieces and checking the chests for false
bottoms, the party is surprised by returning
opponents—and their allies).

Reversed, this card signifies wishes soon to be
fulfilled, chance of unexpected success; sound
counsel, instruction. The next plan devised in
part or whole by the drawer that involves at least
7% but no more than 49% chance of failure, will
be a success, if the scheme is based on stealth,
cunning, or deception (rather than a “smash and
grab” operation).

57: Eight of Swords
A female figure, her eyes covered, stands alone,
surrounded by the swords of the card.

Upright, the Eight of Swords signifies restric-
tion, bondage, betrayal, imprisonment; chagrin;
calumny or censure; temporary sickness. Drawer
will be taken captive (and stripped of all gear,
weapons, and possessions) by the next opposing
group the party meets of greater power than their
own.

Reversed, it signifies prior treachery, disquiet,
unforeseen mishap, fatality. Drawer encounters
wandering monsters at twice the normal chance
until the end of this adventure.

58. Nine of Swords
A woman, racked with despair, is surrounded by
the swords of the card; she is blanketed with
roses, but feels only their thorns.

Upright, this card signifies utter desolation,
despair, misery, death, failure, disappointment,
miscarriage or delay, deception, doubt, illness,
loss. Drawer falls prey to melancholia after nine
turns; if a successful save vs. death magic (at -2)
is made, the melancholia will last for 1d10+2
months; if not, itis permanent. During this
period, the PC is doubly susceptible to illness and
parasitic infestation.

"sees aerate tiicimamammeeanimimenanccel

Reversed, it signifies doubt, suspicion, shame,
patient suffering, “time heals all wounds,” timid-
ity, reasonable fear.

Drawer has a-5 to morale and react at -2 for
2d4+] weeks and heals at half speed until fully
recovered from this adventure. The drawer then
requires an additional 1d4+3 days of rest.

59: Ten of Swords
A body, pierced by ten swords, lies upon a deso-
late plain beneath a blackened sky.

Upright, the Ten of Swords signifies defeat,
darkness, disaster, woe, loss, and desolation (but
not death). Drawer loses the affection of all
lovers, henchman, and associates (reaction and
loyalty rolls are reduced by 3d4 points, with a
new maximum of 11), with the rest of the drawer's
party feeling uneasy around him and wishing to
get rid of the drawer as soon as they can do so
without endangering the party. Any home the
drawer owns will be destroyed or taken, as will
80+1d20% of his or her material wealth.

Reversed, this card signifies benefit, profit,
success, and favor, but of a passing and imperma-
nent sort. Drawer has Id10 additional hit points
for the next 10 days.

60: Page of Swords
An alert, lithe, and energetic youth of dark color-
ing, the Page holds the sword ready for action

long sword +1 with no special abilities. The page
is unable to cast spells.

ing, the Knight rides full tilt across open, storm-
swept country. Brave and proud, he brandishes his
Sword at unseen foes, or from sheer spirit.

Knight of Swords: 5th-level fighter (AC 2, hp 50,
AT 1, Dmg 1-8 or 1d12+3); wears plate mail +1
and wields a long sword +2 with no special abili-

good or evil.

Pentacles
Pentacles represent material and financial mat-
ters, money, occupation, material gain, business
development, and involvement in the world. This
is the suit of the thief, and of the merchant.

66: Three of Pentacles

" insets demerteeeaieeehnaran aetna

64: Ace of Pentacles
A single pentacle takes the form of a large coin or
other piece of precious metal or jewelry; it is usu-
ally held by a hand or hands. In the background
are flowers, butterflies, and the like.

Upright, it signifies gold, content prosperity,
the happiness and pleasure that wealth can bring.
Concealed in or on some item acquired during
this expedition, drawer will discover a gem worth
at least 10,000 gp.

Reversed, it signifies greed, miserliness, that
prosperity which gives no happiness, misused or
corrupted wealth. Effects as above; also, for 2d4
months, all wealth gained by the drawer has no
experience point value at all.

65: Two of Pentacles
A youth in frivolous costume dances and juggles
two pentacles; in the background ships are tossed
on the high sea.

Upright, this card signifies gaiety, lightheart-
edness, grace under pressure, but also difficulty
in launching new ventures or adapting to addi-
tional burdens; variability of moods. Drawer
gains one point of Dexterity, but receives only
half the experience points actually earned until
he or she has enough experience points for the
next level. At this point, drawer will take twice the
usual time for training and study, in order to gain
the new level.

Reversed, it signifies enforced or simulated
gaiety and enjoyment. The next time the drawer is
under attack, he or she will suffer the effects of
Otto’s irresistible dance for 1d4+3 rounds.

66: Three of Pentacles
A master artist or mason carving pentacles in
stonework is regarded approvingly by two robed
figures (probably priests), one of whom holds a
set of plans from which the crafter has been
working.

Upright, it signifies skill, craftsmanship, glory
or renown (particularly in a commercial matter),
mastery, rank and power in one’s profession; it is
also used to signify matters relating to secret
societies, guilds and the like. Drawer receives a
30% bonus on all earned experience points until
the next level is attained; thieves also gain a per-
manent 3% bonus in all professional skills. In
addition, if drawer is a member of a society,
guild, or the like, whose ranks are not based on

character class levels, he or she will soon (3d10

days) be promoted therein.

Reversed, it signifies mediocrity and lack of
skill, ineptitude, sloppiness, mercenary attitude,
lack of destination. Drawer will function in all class
skills as if one level lower, until the next level is
attained. In addition, if a member of such a group
as is mentioned above, drawer will not be promoted
therein for three months afier the customary time,

A hunched-over figure, crowned with one penta-
cle, grasps another fervently with hands and
arms, and stands firmly upon two more; he clings
avidly to what is already held.

Upright, this card signifies making sure of
material gains; worldly gain leading to nothing
beyond it; sometimes (not always) miserliness
and a lack of generosity, but always a monetary,
mercenary concern and point of view. Drawer
receives no experience points for any material
gains made during this expedition, except thieves,
who suffer only a 10% penalty.

Reversed, it signifies material setbacks, oppo-
sition, delay, hindrance, chance of material
losses. From 4-16% (4d4) of the drawer’s total
wealth will disappear or be stolen in the next four
days, never to be recovered.

68: Five of Pentacles
Two ragged figures (one on crutches), a man and
a woman, pass beneath a lighted window ina
snowstorm. They are clearly in distress.

Upright, it signifies loss of home, destitution,
joblessness; affinities discovered through mutual
suffering; generally, troubles in the material-finan-
cial realm. Within 5 weeks of returning from this
adventure, the drawer will lose all homes, savings,
jewelry, magic items and other valuables, and job
(including henchman status), if any; for 5d10 weeks
after drawing this card, drawer will be doubly sus-
ceptible to illness, and to parasitic infestations. If
drawer has a lover or spouse, they will each increase
in loyalty toward each other by 5%.

Reversed, it signifies disorder, discord, severe
toil, overcoming of ruin; new interest in spiritual-
ity; need for charity. Drawer quarrels with the
rest of the party over division of the proceeds of
this expedition, and receives only one fifth of his
or her rightful share. The drawer will spend at
least five days in retreat and meditation under the
tutelage of a priest of his or her faith.

69: Six of Pentacles
An opulently dressed figure, probably a mer-
chant, gives money to the distressed from a bal-
ance or scales, giving out of goodness of heart
from present wealth and plenty.

Upright, the Six of Pentacles signifies just and
righteous charity, gifts and inheritance, wealth
received for good reason, just desserts. When the
proceeds of this expedition are divided up,
drawer’s share is 6d6% larger than it normally
would be; drawer will give at least half of this
bonus to a good religious body, or to a charity
(these monies are not to be given to a player
character, NPC, or ruler, regardless of align-
ments). The effects of this good act, if done by an
evil or neutral character, must be adjudicated by
the DM.

Reversed, it signifies greed, jealousy, pride, or
arrogance of wealth, envy, selfishness, refusal to
give. When the proceeds of this expedition are
divided up, NPCs swindle the drawer, so that his
or her share is (1d6x12%) of what it ought to be.
The drawer does not realize this for at least six
days afterward.

attached to the greenery of the garden-like space
he is tending.

Upright, it signifies speculative pauses, fret-
ting, anxiety, success not yet attained, disappoint-
ment. During the next project the drawer is
engaged in which a long period of time passes
(training for a new level, enchanting an item,
anything requiring 10 days or more for comple-
tion), he or she must save vs. death magic once
each week. Failure to make a successful saving
throw means that the drawer has ruined the
process through over anxiousness, and must
begin anew or pay whatever penalty is imposed
for such interruption. Interruptions caused by
this card cannot exceed seven in number; and on
each saving throw after the first, the drawer has a
cumulative +1 on the roll (thus, the second roil
will be at +1, third at +2, and so on).

Reversed, it signifies impatience, apprehen-
sion, suspicion, especially in money matters.
Drawer will have a permanent -1% reaction to
strangers and casual acquaintances who ask for
favors or act in any way “suspicious,” this penalty
doubles for loans or other financial favors.

71: Eight of Pentactes
An artist sits happily carving out a pentacle; other
completed examples are racked neatly nearby.

Upright, this card signifies work, craftsman-
ship, skills (perhaps still at an apprentice level);
job or commission to come. If drawer is less than
3rd-level (or less than four combined levels, for a
multiclassed character), he or she gains 3d8 hun-
dred experience points, if higher, the gain is
3d8x10 experience points.

Reversed, it signifies vanity, thwarted ambi-
tion, greed, usury, skill in cunning and intrigue,
sharp practices, Drawer will soon (8d8 days) be
shortchanged or hoodwinked in a major transac-
tion, losing at least 8,000 but not more than
80,000 gold pieces. If drawer is a thief, there is a
gain 1d12x100 experience points.

71; Nine of Pentacles
A stately woman stands in a flourishing vineyard,
presumably part of her manorial domain. On her
wrist is a tame hawk; she is otherwise alone, and
seems serene in her isolation.

Upright, the Nine of Pentacles signifies secu-
rity, prudence, wealth, self-sufficiency, love of
gardens and home, comfort in material matters.
For the rest of this expedition or adventure, any

pickpocketing attempts upon the drawer fail
(although the thief will not be caught); and until
the drawer returns, his or her home is safe from
robbery, burglary, and banditry. Drawer also
gains a secondary skill in gardening. If a mage
with no familiar, the next time the drawer is in an
outdoor setting a hawk will come, tamely, to
serve as a familiar; it will be fully trained for
hunting too.

Reversed, this card signifies robbery, loss of
things treasured, roguery, danger from thieves.
Caution is advised. There will be a burglary, rob-
bery, or bandit raid on the drawer’s home or
headquarters during the present absence; much
(60-90%) of the drawer's property will be stolen,
including at least one item precious to the drawer.

73: Ten of Pentacles
A man and a woman stand in the entryway of a
house; a child and an elderly man each pet a dog
contentedly.

Upright, the card denotes gain, security, riches,
family, home, stability. Drawer soon (5d10 days)
gains a small but sturdy home, free of encum-
brance; this may be gift of a ruler or patron, an
inheritance or dowry—whatever is natural for the
campaign.

Reversed, it signifies loss, robbery, family mis-
fortunes; elderly people may become a burden.
Drawer will soon (5d10 days) become obligated for
the care of his parents, clan/guild/village elders,
feudal dependents, or other aged persons to whom
drawer is obligated (whether aware of it or not).

74; Page of Pentacles
A Pentacle rests lightly in, or hovers over, the
hands of the Page, a very dark youth who moves
slowly through a flourishing field, his gaze seem-
ingly fixed upon the lone symbol in studious
reverie.

After a card is drawn from the tracer deck, it
remains attuned to the creature that drew it until
the card vanishes eight hours later. The user need
only concentrate for one round to find the exact
direction and distance of the card for a range of
24 miles. A thief may place a card on a victim,
unnoticed, with the same chance of success as a
pickpockets attempt.

of Wondrous Power

**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 20,000
The Book of Marvelous Magic
This unusual deck has 52 cards and appears to be
standard, large deck. Its creation and powers are
complete mysteries, When touched, the deck
speaks and announces that its power is available
but that it will disappear in 24 hours. It further
explains that each member of the group finding it
may draw one card, and only one card, during that
time. The deck does not speak again. If a second
card is drawn by any individual, or if a card is
drawn by someone who is not a member the
group that found it, the deck disappears immedi-
ately, and the card is lost. The deck of wondrous
power disappears 24 hours after making its
speech: it disappears earlier if all persons entitled
to a draw have either drawn or turned down the
chance.

During the game, an ordinary, modern 52
card deck is used. The DM shuffles the deck,
and the players may each turn down the offer to
draw or take a chance with the deck. To deter-
mine the effect, the player cuts the cards and
turns over the top card; its effect is then immedi-
ately applied to the character. The card is then
replaced, and the DM shuffles again before pro-
ceeding to the next player.

Red cards give good fortune, but black cards
bode ill. The effects cannot be altered, even with
a wish, but some bad results can be changed with
time. For example, if experience points are lost,
the character may regain them by normal means.
(Optional rule: Hearts and Spades cause double
effects.) The effects of the cards are:

Ace: If red, gain one wish. If black, lose one
wish already possessed or the first wish gained
thereafter.

King: Gain (red) or lose (black) 50,000 experi-
ence points (minimum of 0).

Desk

A desk is a piece of furniture, almost always
made of wood, used for studying, working,
writing, or reading. They have broad, level writ-
ing surfaces as well as drawers and compart-
ments to store paper, writing utensils, books,
and ink. Magical desks generally aid their users
to read, study, gain spells, or use general skills
and proficiencies related to the Intelligence
attribute.

Made during the Age of Dreams, this device was
given to Caramon by Par-Salian. The DM should
be aware that the device has different properties
depending upon when the PCs encounter it.
Originally, the device’s use was restricted to the
major races—humans, elves, and ogres—since
all other races are prohibited from traveling in
time. It was also originally designed to be used
by one person only.

This jeweled scepter can fold down into a nonde-
script-looking pendant. Since the device is essen-
tial to the return of the person using it, it has
several safeguards. Anyone attempting to steal it
(even a kender) immediately feels a strong revul-
sion and puts it back instantly. If lost, the device
makes its way back to its owner by any means
necessary.

An example of this occurred when Tasslehoff
gave the device to Raistlin in a dwarven prison
and then discovered he was in possession of the
device once more—it automatically returned to
the kender. No force can keep this artifact from
finding its owner.

Dice of Certain Wagering

The properties of the device changed some-
what after Gnimsh—the only known gnome in
the history of Krynn whose inventions ever
worked—altered it. From that point on, the
device transported more than one person and it
also transported those of the minor races-—
kender, gnomes, and dwarves.

The collect version of the chant and instruction
goes as follows: Holding the pendant in hand,
repeat the first verse, turning the face toward you.
At the second verse, move the face plate from the
right to the left. At the recitation of the third
verse, the back plate drops to form two spheres
connected by rods. At the fourth verse, twist the
top clockwise and a chain drops down. The fifth
verse warns to make certain the chain is clear of
the mechanism. As the sixth verse instructs, hold
the device by each sphere and, while reciting the
seventh verse, rotate them forward. The chain
winds itself into the body. Hold the device over
your head, repeating the final verse, and summon
a clear vision of where you want to go and what
time period you want when you arrive.

Thy time is thy own,
Though across it you travel.

Its expanses you see,
Whirling across forever.
Obstruct not its flow.

Grasp firmly the end and the beginning.
Turn them forward upon themselves.
All that is loose shall be secure.
Destiny is over your own head.

When the device is used, PCs within 10 feet of
the device move to either the desired time (the
place is up to the DM) or the desired place (the
time is up to the DM). Unfortunately for the char-
acters, they cannot have it both ways. Moving to
the location of the treasure in a tower may seem
like a good idea, unless you arrive before the
tower was built (and find a long drop to the
ground). Moving to a certain time in history can
be fun, until you materialize in the middle, of an
arena. The DM can use this little loophole to set
players where he or she wants them.

Dice
Dice are usually six-sided cubes with a different
“value” on each side generally ranging from one
to six. They are usually used in games of chance
and gambling. Other dice are available, but these

“titel a eae

are very rare. These dice include 4-sided pyra-
mids (with the rolled value read along the bottom
of the exposed faces), 8-sided, 10-sided, 12-sided,
20-sided, 24-sided, and 30-sided dice. A coin can
be used, in effect, as a 2-sided die.

This insidious magical item was created by
Huriot, an enterprising follower of Mask and the
greatest Prince of Thieves that Skuld has ever
known. Five centuries ago, he was captured, con-
victed of grave robbing, and brought to the
pharaoh for his final justice. Huriot persuaded the
pharaoh to let a game of chance decide his fate: If
he won, he would be sold into slavery, and if he
lost, he would be executed. He brought out a pair
of dice.

These dice were magical, created by a great
wizard, They would roll any number that the
owner desired; in the hands of the owner, they
would roll what he or she wanted, while in the
hands of another, they would roll as the original
owner desired. The pharaoh detected the magic,
discovered what they were, and used his divine
powers to reverse the effect.

Huriot had planned to lose the game, gambling
that a display of honesty might earn a pardon
from a magnanimous pharaoh. He won instead
and was placed in slavery for the rest of his days.
No one ever heard of Huriot again, except for an
inscription in that pharaoh’s tomb: “Huriot was
here.”

intertwine to form a twisting stem of intermit-

tent bright and dull bands. The base is likewise

formed of alternating projections of the silvery
and ebon metals spreading to form eight legs.
The whole object is about a foot tall and just
over half as broad, with a weight of between
three and four pounds. Although the dicerion of
light and darkness gives off a faint dweomer of
its own, it must have specially manufactured
candles to function magically. A pair of candles
must be made from the purest wax, and finely
powdered obsidian must be set in alternating
layers within the wax. When the candles are
blessed, then set in the sockets of the dicerion’s
arms, the whole radiates a powerful, magical
aura, When both special candles are lighted, the
wizard holding the dicerion can see into any
form of darkness or the brightest of light as if
the illumination were normal! daylight. Further-
more, upon command of the wizard, the candles
emit a strange, metallic illumination that dispels
all natural shadows within a 30-foot radius.
However, when this power is used, a wizard’s
specially endowed vision to see in darkness or
light does not function. A special candle burns
for 1d4+4 turns in a gentle draft like that created
by walking while holding the dicerion. A strong
draft reduces the burning time by 1 to 2 turns. If
the candle remains still and unaffected by
breezes, it lasts for 1d8+8 turns.

If only the candle held in the black arm of the
dicerion is lighted, the wizard is effectively
shrouded in a sphere of darkness of 15-foot
radius. The lack of illumination does not ham-
per the wiazrd’s vision or movement, but does
affect all other creatures within the area of
effect. If a bright light strikes the wizard’s eyes
while in the darkness, he or she is blinded for
1d4 rounds. Conversely, when only the candle in
the shining branch is lighted, a sphere of bril-
liant, white light surrounds the wizard, who suf-
fers no vision impairment as long as the dicerion
is touched or held, but the radiation blinds crea-
tures of darkness (evil) for 2d4 rounds. Even
those of light (good) are unable to look in the

. direction of the light without being blinded for

1d4 rounds. If magical darkness envelops the
wizard while the dicerion is in the light, he or
she is unable to see for 1d4 rounds. In either
case, even though only one candle is burning,
both branches of the dicerion must actually con-
tain tapers.

It is not known who devised these strange
weapons—small, sharp-edged, circular metal
plates with thick centers that taper smoothly
toward the edges. Often used by halflings (who
may sell them to humans, elves, and giff), they
are missile weapons, and may be used without
penalty by those proficient in slings or throw-
ing stars. A discus striking a being causes
1d4+1 points of damage, and interrupts any
ongoing spellcasting or activity requiring dex-
terity. It forces a Dexterity check on characters
who are climbing or clinging to rigging. A
failed check indicates a fall.

Its strike also forces a saving throw vs. crush-
ing blow for all glass and other fragile items it
strikes. All magical items except helms and arti-
facts struck by a discus of disenchantment must
save vs. spell at +2, in addition to any usual
bonuses, or be rendered magically inert for
1d4+1 turns. The DM should also make another,
secret saving throw for any such inert item. If it
fails, it has been drained of all magic, forever.
Any discus striking a magical item exhausts its
own magical powers at once, releasing this magi-
cal energy and that of the drained item harmlessly
into the surrounding area.

known only to Rary and Robilar. The disks’ code
words can be changed at will by Rary alone.

A single master disk controls all the others. An
individual who knows the proper code words can
be instantly teleported without error, either from
the master disk to one of the other disks through-
out the fortress, or from a lesser disk back to the
master disk. Transport between the minor disks is
not possible. Rary must first teleport back to the
master disk in order to move to a different room.
Each lesser disk has a different code word. A sec-
ond, entirely different code word is required to
teleport back to the master disk.

of History

DRAGON Magic’
This crystal disk is about 5 feet thick and 25 feet
in diameter. It is a disk of history, similar to a
crystal ball, used by the dragons to observe past
events. Events observed in the disk of history are
seen as a series of silent images, the end of one
blending into beginning of the next. A user must
concentrate on the event he or she wants to
observe. The event appears in the disk in 3d20
minutes. It is important that the user concentrate
on a specific event. For instance, concentrating
only on a mental image of Artha won’t work.
However, concentrating on Artha’s last stand.on
the Peak of Clouds in the Aslivar Range will dis-
play that battle.

Success with the disk of history is not auto-
matic. It cannot conjure images more than 500
years old. A character may attempt to use it only
once per day. A person’s base chance of success is
10%. A dragon’s base chance of success is 20%.

With Alarm: 3,500 17,500

DRAGON Magazine 194

A tantalus is a nonmagical piece of furniture, a
liquor-stand that uses wooden or metal rods to
keep the bottles and glasses in the stand from
moving about. Jenser s tantalus is a mobile, mag-
ical version of the same sort of device, designed
to transport magical potions or other fragile
items, keeping them safe and within easy reach
for the mage’s use.

Although there is no evidence that this magical
item was created (or even used) by Tenser, the
famed wizard of Greyhawk, the reasons its origin
was erroneously attributed to him are obvious;
Tenser '’s tantalus is a flat metal disc, 3 feet in
diameter, which floats at a constant 3 feet above
the surface of the ground (under most circum-
stances) and at the same 3 feet distance from its
user unless specifically commanded otherwise.
But while it shares much in common with the
Tenser's floating disc spell, it also has a number
of significant differences, the primary one being
that Tenser’s tantalus is a permanent magical
item, not a temporary magical spell.

The disc’s upper surface emits a soft glow
extending for about a foot above the metal. Any
objects placed entirely within this field are sub-
ject to a powerful, quasimagnetic force that holds
any nonliving matter (including once living mate-
rials such as paper, leather, or a small dead body,
as well as completely inanimate matter like glass,
metal, or crystal) firmly to the surface of the disc,
but that has no effect on living flesh, even crea-
tures small enough to fit within the field’s con-

fines. No matter what pressures are exerted
against it, the tantalus will protect objects within
its field from the effects of violent motions and
other external shocks unless those shocks are
powerful enough to destroy the metal disc. For
this purpose, treat the disc as a metal shield, using
Table 29: Item Saving Throws in the DMG.

Since the quasi-magnetic force doesn’t affect
objects only partially within its area of effect,
bottles taller than the 1-foot field cannot be held
by a Zenser'’s tantalus unless laid on their sides.
Bottles can be stacked, but that is difficult.
Reaching through the glowing field and grabbing
an object on the disc frees the object—when an
object is grabbed, the field reacts as if the object
is physically connected to the arm and thus as if it
extends beyond the edge of the field.

Because objects only partially within the field
aren’t affected, a thrown spear can wreak havoc
on the disc’s load—a spear is long enough that
part of it is always outside of the field. On the
other hand, a sling bullet hurled at the bottles can-
not break them because the field affects it as soon
as the bullet is fully within its boundaries, leaving
the bullet suspended in midair, just inside the
edge of the field. For maximum protection,
potions should be placed as close to the center of
the Jenser’s tantalus as possible, protecting them
from weapons shorter than the 1/4-foot radius of
the disc. If the disc is fully loaded, items close to
the edge can be easily affected by short weapons
such as hand axes or daggers.

A Tenser's tantalus can hold up to 20 pounds
of bottles and contents (the average potion in a
glass bottle weighs about half a pound), and will
smoothly accelerate and decelerate to safely, fol-
lowing its owner at any speed up to 18, including
climbing stairs. If the user moves beyond the 50-
foot, effective range of command, the tantalus
ceases all movement and hovers in place until
either its user returns or another wizard takes
control of it.

A Tenser’s tantalus will follow its owner if he
or she falls into a pit, but because of the owner’s
rapid acceleration, the wizard will soon out-strip
the disc’s power to follow. In a pit less than 75
feet deep, the disc gently descends to the bottom
a few seconds after its owner. If the pit is deeper,
the owner will eventually accelerate out of the
50-foot range, meaning that the disc will stop in
midair some 50 feet down from the top of the pit,
waiting for someone to come within range and

take command. .

Because such an obvious display of treasures
increases the possibility of theft, many Jenser’s
tantaluses are equipped with a permanent alarm
spell with a volume loud enough to be heard from
50 feet away, but no farther. The alarm sounds
when anything enters the field without speaking
the command word that deactivates the alarm.
Semi-solid manipulators, such as unseen ser-
vants, telekinesis, or Bigby’s hand spells, air ele-
mentals, or gusts of wind are all too tenuous to
reach into the field and take or destroy items, but
all of these will activate the alarm.

A thief could attempt to steal the entire disc
away from its owner. This requires a Strength
check on 4d6 to break the disc’s attraction to its
owner. If the thief takes the disc more than 50 feet
from its owner (and remember, the alarm will
sound unless the thief manages to touch only the
bottom and rim of the disc), it is free to be com-
manded by another wizard.

Dome of Shapes
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 5,000
DRAGON Magic
This dome is transparent, and about 50 feet
across. Dark lines, shadowy angles, and vague
shapes drift in and out of each other inside the
dome. With every movement of the observer, the
shapes pulsate and appear to turn inside out.

The dome acts as a sort of hypnotic pattern.
Anyone staring at the dome must save vs, spell or
continue gazing at it for 2d10 minutes. The
enchantment is broken if the PC is physically
pulled away from the dome by a companion who
shields his or her eyes.

Door
DRAGON Magazine 41

Doors are usually made of wood with metal trim-
mings. Some doors have locks; most have hinges,
doorknobs or hasps, and occasionally brackets for
supporting a heavy wooden bar. Magical doors
may do nearly anything; some do not even look
like doors.

As a general rule, doors are treated with indif-
ference. You either bash them down, burn them,
or spike them shut and then forget about them.
However, doors have great possibilities for
adding surprise and humor to your campaign.
Use the table below to determine the type of door.
Once the door type is learned, roll on the second

Aruthir’s Living
**XP Value:** 600 **GP Value:** 3,000
1992 Fantasy Collector Card 38

The living door was created by the druid Aruthir
as a gift for a band of wood elves who introduced
him to the Great Druid. By producing a special
magical combination of the plant door and speak
with plants spells, he was able to create a thick
overgrowth that recognizes the specific body
odor of wood elves. Upon sensing wood elves,
the door untangles and lets them pass. Aruthir
placed the living door over the entrance to a cave
that leads to a box canyon where the Great Druid
resides. The cave entrance is now completely
obscured by the /iving door, resembling a rock
face with creeping vines growing over it and is
95% undetectable without magical means.

Back
**XP Value:** 3,000 **GP Value:** 15,000
The Book of Marvelous Magic
When opened, this door causes the creature open-
ing it to immediately turn around facing away from
it (no saving throw). The victim cannot face the
door for three rounds but may move away from it.

Black Crystal
**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 10,000
Gods, Demigods, & Heroes
Made of an interdimensional metal that does not
break. This door is unaffected by magic and opens
only with the proper, magical command word.

Door of Displacement

i rere

of Disappearance
**XP Value:** 3,000 **GP Value:** 15,000
The Book of Marvelous Magic
This locked door becomes invisible when touched by any object or creature, but it remains stoutly in place. Characters who can see invisible things cannot see through the door, but it is completely transparent to anyone else. A knock spell does not open its invisible lock unless the caster is able to see invisible things. Any attempt to open locks is penalized by -50% from normal chances, and the attempt automatically fails if the thief is of less than 9th level. The door reappears one hour after vanishing.

of Displacement
**XP Value:** 2,000 **GP Value:** 10,000
The Book of Marvelous Magic

This door appears to be a black circle of cloth 2 inches in diameter. It does not function outdoors. If placed on a wall or floor, it may be manually lengthened, then widened and turned into a normal door. The user must immediately open the door and go through (no saving throw); others may follow. All passing through the door enter an otherdimensional space adjacent to the room or corridor in which the door was used.

The user of the door, and only the user, can see
Front Door into the original room or corridor. The door, at the user’s command, folds up into cloth form and reappears among the user’s possessions. As the door is stowed, it creates a loud slamming noise.

At any time up to one turn after creating and passing through the door, the user may reopen it from inside, and at any chosen place along a wall ceiling, or floor of the original room or corridor. When opened, it is silent, and the user and his or her party gain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls against any creatures in the room or corridor. (The door can be used to escape a monster and then to quickly reenter the area behind it). If those using the door do not return to normal space within one turn after “slamming” it, they are all dumped back into the original area at randomly determined locations. The door may be used once per day.

Front
**XP Value:** 3,000 **GP Value:** 15,000
The Book of Marvelous Magic
When touched, the front door emits the sound of a welcome chime, attracting the attention of all creatures within 60 feet.

of Guarding
**XP Value:** 4,000 ‘**GP Value:** 20,000
The Book of Marvelous Magic
This door ts intelligent, but not actually alive. When touched, a large mouth appears on its surface; the mouth can appear on only one side of the door at any one time. The door is neutral and obeys whoever utters the proper command word.
If more than one creature knows the proper word, the door changes allegiance as often as commanded.

The door has excellent sight and hearing and is able to see invisible things and hear all noises within 60 feet. It speaks all languages and can obey even the most complex and detailed instructions. It can speak at any volume from a whisper to a loud scream, the latter audible within 120 feet. It cannot be unlocked, even with a knock spell, but may open itself, depending on its instructions. It cannot move except to swing on hinges. It cannot attack, but screams an alarm if it is, and there is a 50% chance it may do so if merely threatened with fire. The door is immune to all attacks except physical damage from magical weapons (treat as AC 0; hp 40).
Unless otherwise commanded, the door’s reactions to visitors are checked normally, but if given a good soaking with wine, it is usually friendly (+2 bonus to reaction rolls after that, lasting one turn per wineskin of wine used).

Revolving
**XP Value:** 1,500 **GP Value:** 7,500
The Book of Marvelous Magic

This apparently normal door causes the user to step back into the original room or corridor, without actually going anywhere. It functions as a normal door if the proper command word is spoken as the door is used.

of Teleportation
**XP Value** **GP Value**
Greater: 4,500 22,500
Lesser: 3,000 15,000
The Book of Marvelous Magic

This item appears to be a normal door but when passed through by any living creature, it teleports the victim and all items carried to either a random or predetermined location. There is no chance of error, which differs from the magic-user spell. Nonliving items thrown through the door are not teleported. If removed from its supports, a door of teleportation normally loses all its enchantment, although the area (and not the door) might be later discovered to be the actual teleportation device. Both lesser and greater doors of teleportation can be found.

The lesser door may be managed by several creatures If they link hands or otherwise overlap in their passage through the door—all arrive at the same destination regardless of randomizing effects. Some lesser doors allow a saving throw vs. spell to resist the effect, but this is not common. If allowed, the saving throw must be made by each creature passing through the doorway. A successful saving throw may simply indicate that the teleportation does not affect that creature, or it may make the door nonmagical for one turn, one hour, of some other length of time. The greater door, which is even more rare, can easily detect and separate different creatures and may even cause items and (occasionally) body parts overlapped to arrive at separate locations, There is no saving throw.

of Terror
**XP Value:** 3,000 **GP Value:** 15,000
® The Book of Marvelous Magic

This apparently normal door causes any creature approaching within 5 feet to be overcome with a nameless dread (no saving throw). The victim thereafter refuses to approach or pass through the door for one hour, after that, the effect wears off. Undead are not affected, nor is any other creature naturally immune to fear effects.

Trick
**XP Value:** 5,000 **GP Value:** 25,000
1992 Fantasy Collector Card 40

There are trick doors known to be installed in the thieves’ guilds of Mulmaster, Hillsfar, Calaunt, and Tantras, but their creator remains unknown. The construction of the door is thought to be a variation of the passwall spell. Each door responds to a different knock code; when the proper sequence of taps is sounded on the door, the person seeking entrance may open it and pass within. Otherwise opening the door reveals nothing but more of the wall in which it rests. To further confuse intruders, some guilds have installed dummy doors along the same wall or alley that contains a trick door.

Dragonisle’s Harbor Chains
**XP Value:** 5,000 **GP Value:** 25,000
Pirates of the Fallen Stars
These harbor chains are huge chains that can be raised from the bottom of the harbor to block the harbor mouth. When raised, the harbor chains prevent any ship from entering or leaving the harbor. The chains are raised primarily to keep out attackers, although in a few instances they have been used to trap unwary captains in the harbor during the periodic factional wars which sweep Immurk’s Hold.

Drawer of Easy Retrieval
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 10,000
DRAGON Magazine 73
A wooden drawer, about 12 by 18 by 9 inches high, which may be inserted into a suitable desk, wall, etc. When anyone who opens the drawer speaks the name of an object inside it, the object pops up at the front of the drawer, within easy reach. If several similar objects, such as sheets of paper, are placed in the drawer, the person placing them may speak a word which becomes the code word for one particular object in the group. The drawer’s magic works only when it is in a proper receptacle of the correct size.

Dress
Dresses are a long, flowing pieces of fabric worn by women. They can be made from literally any type of cloth or animal skin. Dresses are usually worn only in nonarctic climes.

of Amazement
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 9,000
Rogue’s Gallery
The dress of amazement can take on any form, style, or color the owner desires, but always retains an opulent appearance. When worn, the dress of amazement sparkles and reflects light in a pleasant manner. Charisma is raised to racial maximum (or 18). Anyone who looks at the dress must successfully save vs. spell or be subject to hypnotism (as the 8th-level spell). If no light source is near, the dress cannot work. The spell darkness negates any effect from the dress. Dispel magic renders the special effects of the dress non-operational for 1d4 rounds. The touch of the blind also inhibits the dress from operation for one turn, although no one is quite sure why.

of Protection
**XP Value** **GP Value**
Cursed -1: — 1,800
+1 to saves: 1,000 7,500
+1: 1,000 10,000
+2: 2,000 20,000
+3; 3,000 30,000
+4: 4,000 40,000
+5; 5,000 50,000

Rogue's Gallery

This garment appears as a small, black dress or tunic, lined with a series of magical, linked rings. When the dress is donned, it automatically adjusts to fit the wearer. Additionally it provides the wearer the same benefits as a cloak of protection. Each plus of the dress of protection betters Armor Class by one and adds one to saving throw die rolls. Each dress of protection is slightly different in design. To determine how powerful any particular dress is, roll percentile dice and check the table below.

^ Roll ^ Power |
01-10 Cursed (-1 to AC and saves)
11-20 Dress (+1 to saves but not AC)
21-50 Dress +1
51-70 Dress +2
71-86 Dress +3
87-94 Dress +4
95-00 Dress +5

Optional: The dress is vulnerable to blades that have more attack bonuses than the dress has of protection. If the dress is cut by a magical blade with more pluses—an equal or greater number—it ceases to function until magically repaired.

Dunhill’s Spelljamming
Apparatus of Kwalish
**XP Value:** 10,000 **GP Value:** 40,000
1992 Fantasy Collector Card 34
This very special machine has all of the features of a standard apparatus of Kwalish: it contains numerous handles that allow it to operate in 900 feet of water for 1d4+1 hours (AC 0, 200 hp per bulkhead), It has also been fitted with a minor spelljamming helm, allowing it to fly out of the water and into wildspace. The inclusion of the helm means that only one person may use it at a time. Dunhill’s ship shares the basic statistics of a mosquito ship.

Dust

Magical dust is a dry, powdery substance. It is normally found in a metal, bone, or wooden tube, 2 to 6 inches long. The user blows into one end of the tube, aiming at an intended victim or area, and the cloud of dust forms a cone 30 feet long and 10 feet wide at the far end. The 30-foot range applies only when the dust is blown from a tube. If not found in a tube, dust may be in any container, magical or otherwise, and may be thrown 10 feet by hand, poured, or used in any convenient manner.

of Absorption
**XP Value:** 250 **GP Value:** 750
The Book of Marvelous Magic
This dust can absorb up to 100 cubic feet of water or acid and turn it to mud.

of Adhering
**XP Value:** 200 **GP Value:** 1,000
The Book of Marvelous Magic
This dust adheres to any contact or surface poison, poisoned needles and darts, and other traps of this type in the area. It is useful to thieves, giving automatic success when attempting to find traps and a +30% bonus to the remove traps attempt. It does not neutralize the poison, but gives any victim a +4 bonus to any saving throw subsequently required.

Allergy
**XP Value:** 100 **GP Value:** 500
The Book of Marvelous Magic
There are many types of this dust, each made of the powdered bone of some creature, mixed with rare herbs, and then enchanted. The dust is invisible; each victim in the area of effect must make a saving throw vs. spell or become allergic to the specified creature. The allergy might not be noticeable immediately. When a victim comes within 50 feet of the creature specified, the symptoms begin—the eyes water, the nose clogs, and there is a 50% chance that sneezing may occur (checked per round of exposure). The nasal problems cause no penalties; watery eyes cause a -1 penalty to all attack rolls but a +1 bonus to all saving throws against gaze attacks; a sneezing victim may not attack or cast spells. The symptoms pass 1d6 rounds after the victim moves at least 50 feet away from the creature causing the allergy. The allergy is permanent until cure disease is applied by a caster of 15th level or greater. Typical creatures used to make allergy dust are basilisks, dragons, giants, goblins, orcs, rats, trolls, DM’s choice.

of Appearance
**XP Value:** 1,000 **GP Value:** 5,000
DUNGEON MASTER Guide, 1st Edition
This fine powder appears like any other dust unless a careful examination is conducted. This reveals it to be a very fine, very light metallic dust. A single handful of this substance flung into the air coats all objects, making them visible even if they are invisible, out of phase, astral, or ethe- real. Note that the dust also reveals mirror images and projected images for what they are, and like- wise negates the effects of cloaks of displacement or elvenkind and robes of blending. The dust’s effect lasts for 2d10 turns.

Dust of appearance is typically stored in small silk packets or hollow bone blow tubes. A packet can be shaken out to cover an area in a radius of 10 feet from the user. A tube can be blown in a cone shape, 1-foot wide at the start, 15 feet at the end, and 20 feet long. As few as five or as many as 50 containers may be found in one place.

of Blandness
**XP Value** **GP Value**
Blandness: 20 100
Piquantness: 20 100
Prince of Lankhmar

This item is the proud creation of an evil man. Often in the pay of the Thieves’ Guild, he creates and activates new and unusual spells and items to further the cause of chaos, evil, and pain. This is one such item that makes his job easier.

Instead of worrying that the poisons that he concocts are tasteless and void of their olfactory elements, he sprinkles the dust of blandness upon them. The item efficiently deadens the olfactory and taste qualifications of the poisonous creation, rendering them completely bland. The poisons are thus detectable only through detect poison or other divination spells with similar effects.

The dust of blandness may also be used to deter the taste and smell of rotted foods should someone wish to poison a character in that way. Then too, the taste of good food that has a distinctive odor and taste, such as eggplant or liver, can be counteracted with the use of this dust of blandness.

This item is not usually found for sale, but when it is, the cost is 100 gp per vial. Each vial has enough dust for use on six standard plates of food; a standard plate being the food the average person can consume at one sitting.

The dust of blandness has its opposite, which is the dust of piquantness. This item makes the flavor and odor of food unmistakable. It allows the aficionado of food and drink to fully enjoy the flavors and wafting odors of food. The dust also brings out the smell of poisons and causes the odors of burnt or ill-cooked food to be unmistakable.

The dust of piquantness is sold for the same price as the dust of blandness: a mere 100 gp per vial. The dust of piguantness is much more readily available than its counterpart.

of Blending
**XP Value:** 1,250 **GP Value:** 5,000
DUNGEON Magazine 17
his magical dust is usually found in a small leather bag on which magical sigils in silver foil are drawn. Each of the 2d6 cakes of dust found in a bag resembles a crumbly chunk of yellow dirt about 3 inches in diameter.

If thrown against a creature or inanimate object, a cake of dust of blending explodes in a harmless shower of yellow and red sparks and causes the immediate area to blend in with its surroundings so as to be 90% invisible, even to close inspection. Each cake can cover an area of 50 cubic feet. The magic from the dust of blending lasts for 1d6+6 turns.

The dust can be washed off, thus revealing the object or creature it was meant to conceal. It may also be blown off by winds in excess of 40 mpu. If a creature moves while coated, there is a 10% chance per turn of movement that the dust will be shed. This dust was used by the elves to conceal their scouts and positions within the forest while they lay in ambush for the goblin patrols.
