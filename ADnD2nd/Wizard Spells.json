They are completely unable to cause a toss of hit points, cannot affect the concentration of spellcasters, and can only create small, obviously magical materials. Furthermore, materials created by a cantrip are extremely fragile and cannot be used as tools of any sort.

Wizards typically use cantrips to impress common folk, amuse children, and brighten dreary lives.

If the familiar dies, the wizard must successfully roll an immediate system shock check or die. Even if he survives this check, the wizard loses 1 point from his Constitution when the familiar dies.</p><p>The power of the conjuration is such that it can be attempted but once per year. When the wizard decides to find a familiar, he must load a brass brazier with charcoal. When this is burning welt, he adds 1,000 gp worth of incense and herbs. The spell incantation is then begun and must be continued until the familiar comes or the casting time is finished. The DM secretly determines all results. Note that most familiars are not inherently magical, nor does a dispel magic spell send them away.</p><p>Deliberate mistreatment, failure to feed and care for the familiar, or continuous unreasonable demands have adverse effects on the familiars relationship with its master. Purposely arranging the death of one&amp;apos;s own familiar incurs great disfavor from certain powerful entities, with dire results.</p><br/><table><thead><tr><th>D20</th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><th>Roll</th><th>Familiar*</th><th>Sensory Powers</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1-5</td><td>Cat, black</td><td>Excellent night vision k superior hearing</td></tr><tr><td>6-7</td><td>Crow</td><td>Excellent vision</td></tr><tr><td>8-9</td><td>Hawk</td><td>Very superior distance vision</td></tr><tr><td>10-11</td><td>Owl</td><td>Night vision equals human daylight vision, superior hearing</td></tr><tr><td>12-13</td><td>Toad</td><td>Wide-angle vision</td></tr><tr><td>14-15</td><td>Weasel</td><td>Superior hearing k very superior olfactory power</td></tr><tr><td>16-20</td><td>No familiar</td><td>available within spell range</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><p>* The referee can substitute other small animals suitable to the area.</p>"

Unwilling victims must be touched and are then allowed a saving throw vs. spell to negate the effect.

The fireball fills an area equal to its normal spherical volume (roughly 33,000 cubic feet—thirty-three 10&amp;apos; x 10&amp;apos; x 10&amp;apos; cubes). Besides causing damage to creatures, the fireball ignites all combustible materials within its burst radius, and the heat of the fireball melts soft metals such as gold, copper, silver, etc. Exposed items require saving throws vs. magical fire to determine if they are affected, but items in the possession of a creature that rolls a successful saving throw are unaffected by the fireball.</p><p>The wizard points his finger and speaks the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A streak flashes from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball (an early impact results in an early detonation), Creatures failing their saving throws each suffer full damage from the blast. Those who roll successful saving throws manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll aside, each receiving half damage (the DM rolls the damage and each affected creature suffers either full damage or half damage I round fractions down), depending on whether the creature saved or not).</p><p>The material component of this spell is a tiny ball of bat guano and sulphur.</p>"

The caster is able to reveal the original contents by speaking a command word, perusing the actual page, and then returning it to its secret page form. The caster can also remove the spell by double repetition of the command word. Others noting the dim magic of a page with this spell cloaking its true contents can attempt to dispel magic, but if it fails, the page is destroyed. A true seeing spell does not reveal the contents unless cast in combination with a comprehend languages spell, An erase spell can destroy the writing.</p><p>The material components are powdered herring scales and either will o&amp;apos; wisp or boggart essence.</p>"

Failure to save indicates that the damage inflicted is 2d4 points, the ebon member is wrapped around its subject, and damage will be 3d4 points on the second and succeeding rounds. Since these tentacles have no intelligence to guide them, there is the possibility that they entwine any object—a tree, post, pillar, even the wizard himself—or continue to squeeze a dead opponent. A grasping hold established by a tentacle remains until the tentacle is destroyed by some form of attack or until it disappears at the end of the spell&amp;apos;s duration.</p><p>The component for this spell is a piece of tentacle from a giant octopus or giant squid.</p>"

The reverse—polymorphing a higher Intelligence creature into one of significantly lower Intelligence-results in a creature much more intelligent than appearances would lead one to believe. The polymorphed creature must succeed on a system shock (see Table 3) roll to see if it survives the change.

Form includes natural Armor Class (that due to skin toughness, but not due to quickness, magical nature, etc.), physical movement abilities (walking, swimming, flight with wings, but not plane shifting, blinking, teleporting, .), and attack routines (claw/claw/bite, swoop, rake, constriction, but not petrification, breath weapons, energy drain, etc.). Hit points and saving throws do not change from the original form. Noncorporeal forms cannot be assumed.

Creatures not used to a new form might be penalized at the DM&amp;apos;s option (e.g., -2 to attack rolls) until they practice sufficiently to master it.</p><p>When the physical change occurs, there is a base 100% chance that the subject&amp;apos;s personality and mentality change into that of new form (i.e., a roll of 20 or less on 1d20).

The cost of such a chest is never less than 5,000 gp. Once it is constructed. the wizard must have a tiny replica (of the same materials and perfect in every detail) made, so that the miniature of the chest appears to be a perfect copy.

This causes the large chest to vanish into the Ethereal plane. The chest can contain one cubic foot of material per level of the wizard no matter what its apparent size. Living matter makes it 75% likely that the spell fails, so the chest is typically used for securing valuable spell books, magical items, gems, etc. As long as the spellcaster has the small duplicate of the magical chest, he can recall the large one from the Ethereal plane whenever the chest is desired.

From there the caster can force an exchange of life forces between the receptacle and another creature, thus enabling the wizard to takeover and control the body of another creature, while the life force of the host is confined in the receptacle. The special life force receptacle must be within spell range of the wizard&amp;apos;s body at the time of spellcasting. The wizard&amp;apos;s life force shifts into the receptacle in the round in which the casting is completed, allowing no other actions.</p><p>While in the magic jar, the caster can sense and attack any life force within a 10-foot-pier-level radius (on the same plane): however, the exact creature types and relative physical positions cannot be determined. In a group of life forces, the caster can sense a difference of four or more levels/Hit Dice and can determine whether a life force is positive or negative energy. For example, if two 10th-level fighters are attacking a hill giant and four ogres, the caster could determine that there are three stronger and four weaker life forces within range, all with positive life energy. The caster could try to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but he has no control over exactly which creature is attacked.</p><p>An attempt to take over a host body requires a full round. It is blocked by a protection from evil spell or similar ward. It is successful only if the subject fails a saving throw vs. spelt with a special modifier (see following). The saving throw is modified by subtracting the combined Intelligence and Wisdom scores of the target from those of the wizard (Intelligence and hit dice in nonhuman or nonhumanoid creatures).

Failure to take over the host leaves the wizard&amp;apos;s life force in the magic jar.</p><br/><p>If successful, the caster&amp;apos;s life force occupies the host body and the host&amp;apos;s life force is confined in the magic jar receptacle. The caster can call upon rudimentary or instinctive knowledge of the subject creature, but not upon its real or acquired knowledge (i.e., the wizard does not automatically know the language or spells of the creature), The caster retains his own attack rolls, class knowledge and training, and any adjustments due to his Intelligence or Wisdom, If the host body is human or humanoid, and the necessary spell components are available, the wizard can even use his memorized spells. The host body retains its own hit points and physical abilities and properties. The DM decides if any additional modifications are necessary; for example, perhaps clumsiness or inefficiency occurs if the caster must become used to the new form. The alignment of the host or receptacle is that of   the occupying life force.</p><p>The caster can shift freely from the host to the receptacle if within the 10-feet/level range. Each attempt to shift requires one round. The spell ends when the wizard shifts from the jar to his own body.</p><p>A successful dispel magic spell cast on the host can drive the caster of the magic jar spell back into the receptacle and prevent him from making any attacks for 1d4 rounds plus 1 round per level of the caster of the dispel, The base success chance is 50%, + / — S% per level difference between the casters. A successful dispel magic cast against the receptacle forces the occupant back into his own body. If the wizard who cast the magic jar is forced back into his own body, the spell ends.</p><p>If the host body is slain, the caster returns to the receptacle, if within range, and the life force of the host departs (i,e., it is dead). If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both the host and the caster die.</p><p>Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain unless recalled by a raise dead, resurrection, or similar spell.</p><p>If the body of the caster is slain, his life force survives if it is in either the receptacle or the host. If the receptacle is destroyed while the caster&amp;apos;s life force occupies it, the caster is irrevocably slain.</p>"

The item must meet the following tests: 1) it must be in sound and undamaged condition; 2) the item must be the finest possible, considering its nature, i.e., crafted of the highest quality material and with the finest workmanship; 3) its cost or value must reflect the second test, and in most cases the item must have a raw-materials cost in excess of 100 gp. With respect to requirement 3, it is not possible to apply this test to items such as ropes, leather goods, cloth, and pottery not normally embroidered, bejeweled, tooled, carved, or engraved. If such work or materials can be added to an item without weakening or harming its normal functions, however, these are required for the item to be enchanted.</p><p>The wizard must have access to a workshop or laboratory, property equipped and from which contaminating magic can be screened. Any magical item not related to the fabrication process (such as most protective devices) and within 30 feet of the materials is a source of contaminating magic and will spoil the process.</p><p>The item to be prepared must be touched by the spell caster. This touching must be constant and continual during the casting time, which is a base 16 hours plus an additional 8d8 hours (as the wizard may never work more than eight hours per day, and haste or any other spells will not alter the time required in any way, this effectively means that casting time for this spell is two days +1d8 days). All work must be uninterrupted, and during rest periods the item being enchanted must never be more than one foot distant from the spellcaster, for if it is, the whole spell is spoiled and must be begun again. (Note that during rest periods absolutely no other form of magic can be performed, and the wizard must remain quiet and in isolation or the enchantment is ruined.)</p><p>At the end of the spell, the caster will know that the item is ready for the final test. He will then pronounce the final magical syllable, and if the item makes a saving throw (which is exactly the same as that of the wizard) vs, spell, the spell is completed. The spellcaster s saving throw bonuses also apply to the item, up to +3. A result of 1 on the !d20 roll always results in failure, regardless of modifications. Once the spell is finished, the wizard can begin to place the desired spell upon the item. The spell he plans to place must be cast within 24 hours or the preparatory spell fades, and the item must be enchanted again.</p><p>Each spell subsequently cast upon an object bearing an enchant an item spell requires 2d4 hours per spell level of the magic being cast. Again, during casting the item must be touched by the wizard, and during the rest periods it must always be within one foot of his person. This procedure holds true for any additional spells placed upon the item, and each successive spell must be begun within 24 hours of the last, even if the prior spell failed.</p><p>No magic placed on an item is permanent unless a permanency spell is used as a finishing touch. This always runs a 5% risk of draining 1 point of Constitution from the wizard casting the spell. Also, while it is possible to tell when the basic spell (enchant an item) succeeds, it is not possible to tell if successive castings actually work, for each must make the same sort of saving throw as the item itself made. Naturally, items that are charged—rods, staves, wands, javelins of lightning, ring of wishes, etc.—can never be made permanent. Magical devices cannot be used to enchant an item or cast magic upon an object so prepared, but scrolls can be used for this purpose.</p><p>The materials needed for this spell vary according to both the nature of the item being enchanted and the magic to be cast upon it. For example, a cloak of displacement might require the hides of one or more displacer beasts, a sword meant to slay dragons could require the blood and some other part of the type(s) of dragon(s) it will be effective against, and a ring of shooting stars might require pieces of meteorites and the horn of a ki-rin. These specifics, as well as other information pertaining to this spell, are decided by your Dungeon Master and must be discovered or researched in play.</p>"

A special saving throw is then made to determine if the creature detects the nature of the planar opening as a trap or believes it to be a gate. To save, the creature must roll equal to or less than its Intelligence score on 1d20. The score is modified by the difference between the creature&amp;apos;s Intelligence and that of the spellcaster. If the creature has a higher score, the difference is subtracted from its dice roll to save. If the spellcaster has a higher score, the difference is added to the dice roll.</p><p>If the saving throw succeeds, the creature ignores the spell-created opening, and the spell fails. If the saving throw fails, the creature steps into the opening and is ensnared.</p><p>When so trapped, the other-planar creature can freely attack the ensnaring wizard, unless the caster has created a warding circle. Such circles may be temporary (drawn by hand) or permanent (inlaid or carved), Even with such protection, the entrapped creature may break free and wreak its vengeance upon the spellcaster.</p><p>A hand-drawn circle has a base failure chance of 20%, while one inlaid or carved has a base of 10% (and that is for the first time it is used, to determine whether or not the job was done properly). The base chance is modified by the difference between the wizard&amp;apos;s combined Intelligence and experience level and the Intelligence and the experience level or Hit Dice of the creature ensnared. If the spellcaster has a higher total, that difference in percentage points is subtracted from the chance for the creature to break free. If the creature has a higher total, that difference is added to its chance to break free.</p><p>The chance can be further reduced by careful preparation of the circle. If the handmade circle is drawn over a longer period of time, using specially prepared pigments (1,000 gp value per turn spent drawing), the chance of breaking free is reduced by 1% for every turn spent in preparation. This can bring the base chance to 0% .</p><p>Similarly, an inlaid or carved design can be brought to a 0% chance of the creature breaking free by inlaying with various metals, minerals, etc. This cost will require a minimum of one full month of time and add not less than 50,000 gp to the basic cost of having the circle inlaid or carved into stone. Any break in the circle spoils the efficacy of the spell and enables the creature to break free automatically. Even a straw dropped across the line of a magic circle destroys its power, Fortunately, the creature within cannot so much as place a straw upon any portion of the inscribed ward, for the magic of the barrier absolutely prevents it.</p><p>Once safely ensnared, the creature can be kept for as long as the spellcaster dares. (Remember the danger of something breaking the ward!) The creature cannot leave the circle, nor can any of its attacks or powers penetrate the barrier. The caster can offer bribes, use promises, or make threats in order to exact one service from the captive creature.</p><p>The DM will then assign a value to what the wizard has said to the ensnared creature, rating it from 0 to 6 (with 6 being the most persuasive). This rating is then subtracted from the Intelligence score of the creature. If the creature rolls a successful Intelligence check against its adjusted Intelligence, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, etc., can be made, or the old ones re-offered 24 hours later, when the creature&amp;apos;s Intelligence has dropped by 1 point due to confinement. This can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until the caster decides to get rid of it by means of some riddance spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to.</p><p>Once the single service is completed, the creature need only so inform the spellcaster to be instantly sent from whence it came. The creature might later seek revenge.</p>"

This gaze attack is in addition to any other attacks allowed the wizard. The wizard selects one of four possible gaze attacks at the time the spell is cast, and this attack cannot be changed. For example, a 12th-level caster who chose fear would have four opportunities to make gaze attacks causing fear, one for each round of the spells duration* Any gaze attack is negated by a successful saving throw vs, spell, with Wisdom adjustments. The four effects of the spell are as follows:</p><p>Charm: The wizard can charm a single person or monster by gaze and by uttering a single word. The effect is to make the charmed subject absolutely loyal and docile to the caster, even to the point of personal danger. It is otherwise the same as a charm monster spell. All creatures other than humans, demi-humans, and humanoids save with +2 bonuses.</p><p>Fear: The wizard can cause fear by gaze and by speaking a single word. The subject flees in blind terror for 1d4 rounds. After this, the creature refuses to face the caster and cowers or bolts for the nearest cover if subsequently confronted by the caster (50% chance of either). The latter effect lasts one turn per caster level. This attack can be negated by spells that counter fear.</p><p>Sicken: This power enables the caster to merely gaze, speak a word, and cause sudden pain and fever to sweep over the subject&amp;apos;s body. Creatures with ability scores function at half effectiveness, others inflict only one-half damage with physical attacks. Movement is at one-half normal rate, The subject remains stricken for one turn per level of the caster, after which all abilities return at the rate of one point per turn of complete rest or one point per hour of moderate activity. The effects cannot be negated by a cure disease or heal spell, but a remove curse or successful dispel magic spell is effective. Creatures other than humans, demi-humans, and humanoids save with +2 bonuses versus this attack.</p><p>Sleep: The wizard can cause any individual to fall into a comatose slumber by means of a gaze and a single word, unless the subject successfully rolls its saving throw vs, spell. Creatures normally subject to a 1st-level sleep spell save with - 2 penalties. An affected creature must be shaken or otherwise shocked back to consciousness.</p><p>In all cases, the gaze attack has a speed factor of 1. This spell does not affect undead of any type, or extend beyond the plane occupied by the caster. Note that the caster is subject to the effects of his reflected gaze, and is allowed any applicable saving throw. In the case of a reflected charm gaze, the caster is paralyzed until it wears off or is countered.</p>"

Note that if the globe is not thrown or slung within one round per level of the spell-caster, it shatters and causes cold damage as stated above. This timed effect can be employed against pursuers, although it can prove hazardous to the spellcaster and his associates as well.</p><p>The material component is a 1,000-gp diamond.</p>"

Objects in Leomund&amp;apos;s secret chest cannot be recovered by using this spell.</p><p>Note: If the item is wizard marked, it can be summoned from anywhere on the same plane unless special local conditions apply. Furthermore, the details of the location of the item are more specific, and the item is more easily traceable with other types of scrying magic.</p>"

The spell remains until the magical hedge is somehow broken.</p><p>Metamorphosis: Causes the subject to change to some noncorporeal form, save for its head or face. The binding is permanent until some prescribed act frees the subject.</p><p>Minimus Containment: The subject is shrunken to a height of one inch or even less and held within the hedged prison of some gem or similar object.

However, if the subject is magically weakened, the referee can assign a -1, -2, or even -4 penalty to the saving throw. A successful saving throw enables the subject to burst its bonds and do as it pleases.</p><p>A binding spell can be renewed in the case of the first three forms of the spell, for the subject does not have the opportunity to break the bonds.

This will be determined by your Dungeon Master by using the following guidelines:</p><br/><table><tr><td>Kingdom</td><td>Animal, vegetable, mineral</td></tr><tr><td>Class</td><td>Mammals, bipeds, fungi, metals, etc.</td></tr><tr><td>Relationship</td><td>Twig is to tree, sand is to beach, etc.</td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>Smaller, equal, larger</td></tr><tr><td>Shape</td><td>Comparative resemblance of the original to the poly-morphed state</td></tr><tr><td>Intelligence</td><td>Particularly with regard to a change in which the end product is more intelligent</td></tr></table><br/><p>A change in kingdom makes the spell work for hours or turns—i.e,, hours if one removed, turns if two removed. Other changes likewise affect spell duration, Thus, changing a lion to an androsphinx would be permanent, but turning a turnip to a purple worm would be a change of only hours duration; turning a tusk into an elephant would be permanent, but turning a twig into a sword would be a change of only several turns duration. All polymorphed objects radiate a strong magic, and if a dispel magic spelt is successfully cast upon them, they return to their natural form. Note that a stone to flesh, or its reverse, will affect objects under this spell. As with other polymorph spells, damage sustained in the new form can result in the injury or death of the polymorphed creature, It is possible to polymorph a creature into rock and grind it to dust, causing damage, perhaps even death. If the creature was changed to dust to start with, more creative methods to damage it would have to be applied—perhaps using a gust of wind spell to scatter the dust far and wide In general, damage occurs when the new form is altered through physical force, although the DM will have to adjudicate many of these situations.</p><p>The system shock roll must be applied to living creatures, as must the restrictions noted regarding the polymorph others and stone to flesh spells. Also note that a polymorph effect often detracts from an item s or creature&amp;apos;s powers, but does not add new powers—except possibly movement capabilities not present in the old form. Thus, a vorpal sword polymorphed into a dagger would not retain vorpal capability. Likewise. valueless items cannot be made into permanent valuable items.</p><p>The material components of this spell are mercury, gum arabic, and smoke.</p>"

Magical search by crystal ball, a locate object spell, or similar means will not reveal the fact that a creature is imprisoned. The imprisonment spell functions only if the subject creatures name and background are known.</p><p>The reverse spell, freedom, cast upon the spot at which a creature was entombed and sunk into the earth, causes it to reappear at that spot. If the caster does not perfectly intone the name and background of the creature to be freed, there is a 10% chance that 1 to 100 creatures will be freed from imprisonment at the same time.</p><p>Note: The exact details of any creatures freed are up to the DM. A random method of determining this is to roll percentile dice twice (once for imprisoned creature density and once for a base number of creatures at maximum density). The rolls are multiplied and rounded to the nearest whole number. Each released creature has a 10% chance to be in the area of the spellcaster. If monsters are being generated randomly, roll 1d20 for level, with rolls of 9+ considered 9, and the exact monsters determined by the random encounter tables.</p><p>For example. If the initial rolls were 22 and 60, the number of monsters released is .22 X ,60 = ,1320 =* 13 monsters. Since only 10% of these will be in the immediate vicinity of the caster, the wizard may encounter only one or two of them.</p>"
