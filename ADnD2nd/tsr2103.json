        "Description": "<div>The aarakocra are a race of intelligent bird-men that live on the peaks of the highest mountains, spending their days soaring on the thermal winds in peace and solitude.</div><div>Aarakocra are about five feet tall and have a wing span of 20 feet. About halfway along the edge of each wing is a hand with  three human-sized fingers and an opposable thumb. An elongated fourth finger extends the length of the wing and locks in place for flying. Though the wing-hands cannot grasp during flight, they are nearly as useful as human hands when an aarakocra is on the ground and its wings are folded back. The wing muscles anchor in a bony chest plate that provides the aarakocra with extra protection. The powerful legs end in four sharp talons that can unlock and fold back to reveal another pair of functional hands, also with three human-sized fingers and an opposable thumb. The hand bones, like the rest of an aarakocra’s skeleton, are hollow and fragile.</div><div>Aarakocra faces resemble crosses between parrots and eagles. They have gray-black beaks and black eyes set frontally in their heads that provide keen binocular vision. Plumage color varies from tribe to tribe, but generally males are red, orange, and yellow while females are brown and gray.</div><div>>Aarakocra speak their own language, the language of giant eagles, and, on occasion, the common tongue (10% chance).</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> In aerial combat, an aarakocra fights with either his talons or heavy fletched javelins that he clutches in his lower hands. An aarakocra typically carries a half dozen javelins strapped to his chest in individual sheaths. The javelins, which can be used for throwing or stabbing, inflict 2d4 points of damage. Owing to the aarakocra’s remarkable skill at throwing javelins in the air, it incurs none of the attack penalties for aerial missile fire. An aarakocra will always save its last javelin for stabbing purposes rather than throwing it. Its favorite attack is to dive at a victim while clutching a javelin in each hand, then pull out of the dive just as it reaches his target, and strike with a bloodcurdling shriek. This attack gains a +4 bonus to the attack roll and causes double damage, but an aarakocra must dive at least 200 feet to execute it properly.</div><div>An aarakocra is reluctant to engage in grappling or ground combat, since its fragile bones are easily broken. Though rarely used except when cornered, an aarakocra’s sharp beak can bite for 1-3 points of damage.</div><br/><div><b style= 'color:#4169E1'>Habitat / Society:</b> Aarakocra live in small tribes of about 11-30 (1d20 +10) members. Each tribe has a hunting territory of about 10,000 square miles with colorful banners and pennants marking the boundaries.</div><div>Each tribe lives in a communal nest made of woven vines with a soft lining of dried grass.The eldest male serves as the tribe 's leader. In tribes of more than 20 members, the second oldest male serves as the shaman, leading simple religious ceremonies involving the whistling of melodic hymns at sunset on the first day of a new month. Males spend most of their waking hours hunting for food and occasionally for treasure, such as gems and other shiny objects. Females spend eight months of the year incubating their eggs, passing the time by fabricating javelins and other tools from wood and stone. While resting on their backs, aarakocra females can use all four hands at the same time to weave boundary pennants, javelins sheaths, and other useful objects from vines and feathers.</div><div>Five aarakocra, including a shaman, can summon an air elemental by chanting and performing an intricate aerial dance for three melee rounds, The summoned air elemental will comply with the aarakocras’ request for a favor, though it will not endanger its life on their behalf.</div><div>Aarakocra are extremely claustrophobic and will not willingly enter a cave, building, or other enclosed area.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Aarakocra have little to do with other species, including neighboring aarakocra tribes, and leave their home territory only in extreme circumstances. They rarely encounter humans except for an occasional foray into a rural community to snatcha stray farm animal; this is not an intentionally malicious act, as aarakocra are unable to distinguish between domestic and wild animals, A human venturing into aarakocra territory may be able to convince one to serve as a guide or a scout in exchange for a shiny jewel or coin.</div>",

        "Description": "<div>The aboleth is a loathsome amphibious creature that lives in subterranean caves and lakes.It despises most land - dwelling creatures and seeks to enslave intelligent surface beings.It is as cruel as it is intelligent.</div><div>An aboleth resembles a plump fish, 20 feet in length from its bulbous head to its fluke-like tail. Its body is blue-green with gray splotches, and its pink-tan underbelly conceals a toothless, rubbery mouth. Three slit-like eyes, purple-red in color and protected by bony ridges, are set one atop the other in the front of its head. Four pulsating blue-black orifices line the bottom of its body and secrete gray slime that smells like rancid grease, Four leathery tentacles, each ten feet in length, grow from its head. An aboleth uses its tail to propel itself through the water and its tentacles to drag itself along dry land.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> The aboleth attacks with its tentacles for 1d6 points of damage each. If a victim struck by a tentacle fails a saving throw vs. spell, the victim's skin transforms into a clear, slimy membrane in 1d4+1 rounds. If this occurs, the victim must keep the membrane damp with cool water or suffer 1d12 points of damage each turn. <i>Cure disease</i> cast upon the victim before the membrane completely forms stops the transformation, Otherwise, <i>cure serious wounds</i> will cause the membrane to revert to normal skin.</div><div>Because its sluggish movement makes attacks difficult, the aboleth attempts to lure victims close by creating realistic illusions at will, complete with audible, olfactory, and other sensory components.The aboleth can attempt to enslave creatures within 30 feet;it can make three attempts per day, one creature per attempt.If the victim fails a saving throw vs.spell, he follows all of the aboleth’s telepathic commands, although the victim will not fight on the aboleth’s behalf.The enslavement can be negated by <i>remove curse</i>, <i>dispel magic</i>, the death of the enslaving aboleth, or, if the victim is separated from the aboleth by more than a mile, a new saving throw (one attempt per day.)</div><div>When underwater, an aboleth surrounds itself with a mucous cloud one foot thick. A victim in contact with the cloud and inhaling the mucus must roll a successful saving throw vs. poison or lose the ability to breathe air. The victim is then able to breathe water, as if having consumed a <i>potion of water breathing</i>, for 1-3 hours.This ability may be renewed by additional contact with the mucous cloud, An affected victim attempting to breathe air will suffocate in 2 d6 rounds.Wine or soap dissolves the mucus.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> An aboleth brood consists of a parent and one to three offspring. Though the offspring are as large and as strong as the parent, they defer to the parent in all matters and obey it implicitly.</div><div>Aboleth have both male and female sexual organs, A mature aboleth reproduces once every five years by concealing itself in a cavern or other remote area, then laying a single egg and covering it in slime.The parent aboleth guards the egg while the embryo grows and develops, a process that takes about five years.A newborn aboleth takes about 10 years to mature.</div><div>The aboleth spends most of its time searching for slaves, preferably human ones. It is rumored that the aboleth use their slaves to construct huge underwater cities, though none have ever been found. The aboleth are rumored to know ancient, horrible secrets that predate the existence of man, but these rumors are also unsubstantiated. There is no doubt that aboleth retain a staggering amount of knowledge. An offspring acquires all of its parent's knowledge at birth, and a mature aboleth acquires the knowledge of any intelligent being it consumes.</div><div>An aboleth’s treasure consists of items taken from its slaves.The items are buried in caverns under a layer of slime resembling gray mud, recognizable by the distinctive rancid grease odor.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> The omnivorous aboleth will eat any organic matter, usually algae and micro - organisms, but they are also fond of intelligent prey so they can absorb nutrients and information at the same time.Aboleth have no natural enemies, as even the mightiest marine creatures give them a wide berth.Aboleth slime is sometimes used as a component for <i>potions of water breathing</i>.</div>",

        "Description": "<div>The ankheg is a burrowing monster usually found in forests or choice agricultural land.Because of its fondness for fresh meat, the ankheg is a threat to any creature unfortunate enough to encounter it.</div><div>The ankheg resembles an enormous many-legged worm, Its six legs end in sharp hooks suitable for burrowing and grasping, and its powerful mandibles are capable of snapping a small tree in half with a single bite. A tough chitinous shell, usually brown or yellow, covers its entire body except for its soft pink belly. The ankheg has glistening black eyes, a small mouth lined with tiny rows of chitinous teeth, and two sensitive antennae that can detect movement of man-sized creatures up to 300 feet away.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> The ankheg’s preferred attack method is to lie five to ten feet below the surface of the ground until its antennae detect the approach of a victim. It then burrows up beneath the victim and attempts to grab him in its mandibles, crushing and grinding for 3d6 points of damage per round while secreting acidic digestive enzymes to cause an additional 1d4 points of damage per round until the victim is dissolved. The ankheg can squirt a stream of acidic enzymes once every six hours to a distance of 30 feet. However, since it is unable to digest food for six hours after it squirts enzymes, it uses this attack technique only when desperate. A victim struck by the stream of acidic enzymes suffers 8d4 points of damage (half damage if the victim rolls a successful saving throw vs. poison).</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat / Society:</b> The ankheg uses its mandibles to continuously dig winding tunnels 30-40 feet deep in the rich soil of forests or farmlands. The hollowed end of a tunnel serves as a temporary lair for sleeping, eating, or hibernating. When an ankheg exhausts the food supply in a particular forest or field, it moves on to another.</div><div>Autumn is mating season for ankhegs.After the male fertilizes the female, the female kills him and deposits 2 d6 fertilized eggs in his body.Within a few weeks, about 75 % of the eggs hatch and begin feeding.In a year, the young ankhegs resemble adults and can function independently.Young ankhegs have 2 Hit Dice and an AC 2 overall and an AC 6 for their undersides;they bite for 1 d4 points of damage(with an additional 1 d4 points of damage from enzyme secretions), and spit for 4 d4 points of damage to a distance of 30 feet.In every year thereafter, the ankheg functions with full adult capabilities and gains an additional Hit Die until it reaches 8 Hit Dice.</div><div>Beginning in its second year of life, the ankheg sheds its chitinous shell just before the onset of winter. It takes the ankheg two days to shed its old shell and two weeks to grow a new one. During this time, the sluggish ankheg is exceptionally vulnerable. Its overall AC is reduced to 5 and its underside AC is reduced to 7. Additionally, it moves at only half its normal speed, its mandible attack inflicts only 1d10 points of damage, and it is unable to squirt acidic enzymes, While growing a new shell, it protects itself by hiding in a deep tunnel and secreting a repulsive fluid that smells like rotten fruit, Though the aroma discourages most creatures, it can also pinpoint the ankheg’s location for human hunters and desperately hungry predators.</div><div>Ankhegs living in cold climates hibernate during the winter.Within a month after the first snowfall, the ankheg fashions a lair deep within the warm earth where it remains dormant until spring.The hibernating ankheg requires no food, subsisting instead on nutrients stored in its shell.The ankheg does not secrete aromatic fluid during this time and is thus relatively safe from detection.Though the ankheg 's metabolism is reduced, its antennae remain functional, able to alert it to the approach of an intruder. A disturbed ankheg fully awakens in 1d4 rounds, after which time it can attack and move normally.</div><div>The ankheg does not hoard treasure. Items that were not dissolved by the acidic enzymes fall where they drop from the ankheg's mandibles and can be found scattered throughout its tunnel system.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Though a hungry ankheg can be fatal to a farmer, it can be quite beneficial to the farmland. Its tunnel system laces the soil with passages for air and water, while the ankheg’s waste products add rich nutrients. The ankheg will eat decayed organic matter in the earth, but it prefers fresh meat. All but the fiercest predators avoid ankhegs, Dried and cured ankheg shells can be made into armor with an AC of 2, and its digestive enzymes can be used as regular acid.</div>",

In times of scarce food, the storage ants expel the honey from their mouths to feed the rest of the colony.</div><div>The queen has no responsibilities other than to lay thousands of eggs per week.Her chamber also contains the colony 's treasure, usually shiny jewels the workers collect on hunting expeditions.Nurse ants care for the young in an egg chamber;the larvae hatch and develop into adults in just a few weeks.From 5-50 workers and 5 warriors guard the nursery chamber.</div><br/><div>Ecology: Giant ants prefer to eat seeds and grasses, but they will also eat meat if given the opportunity.Neither giant ants nor their eggs have any commercial value, though some gourmets enjoy their honey.In a pinch, giant ants are a good source of protein.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Swarm</b></div><div>There is no sight more fearsome than a swarm of red or golden army ants on the march through a tropical forest, steadily consuming everything in their path.The individual ants resemble smaller versions of giant ants, red or golden in color with powerful mandibles.The swarm is a mobile colony of 3/4” - long workers numbering in the thousands(to determine the number of ants in the swarm, roll 1 d10 and multiply the result by 1, 500).A single queen, identical to the workers except for her sex and tiny unusable wings, marches in the center the swarm.If the queen is killed, the swarm dissipates.</div><div>The swarm moves in a straight line as a solid block of ants(about 150 ants per square foot).The ants eat all organic matter in their path, including any creatures too slow to get out of their way.If the ants approach a river or other obstacle, they turn 90 degrees and continue their march.They will not go out of their way to attack and are therefore easy to avoid.Any creature in contact with the swarm has a 90 % chance per round of suffering 1d6 points of damage from bites; if bitten, the creature must roll a successful saving throw vs.poison or suffer an additional 1d2 points of damage from the mild poison.Check for bites and poison for each round the creature is in contact with the swarm.Each point of damage inflicted on the swarm kills 1 d20 ants.Ants may be scattered with smoke or fire;immersion in water washes them off.If half of a swarm is killed, the surviving ants attempt to scatter and hide;since the ants scatter equally in every direction, this actually increases the possibility a creature in the vicinity may be attacked.If an entire swarm is killed, award 975 experience points per 1,500 ants.</div>",

Its body, gray or sandy brown in color, is covered completely by a leathery exoskeleton with patches of coarse black bristles that are sensitive to movement and odor, It has deep - set beady eyes, rows of jagged teeth capable of both tearing and grinding, and six thick legs with sharp claws and flat bristles.The claws are used for digging while the bristles sweep away the loose soil.The ant lion’s most prominent features are its mandibles, silvery gray and razor - edged, extending three feet from it’s mouth. A single barb centered on the inner ridge of each mandible is used to impale and hold prey.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> The ant lion seldom stalks or pursues prey.Instead, it digs deep, tapering pits about 60 feet in diameter, buries itself at the bottom beneath a covering of sand, gravel, and stones, then patiently waits for falling victims.About 50 % of the time, the entrance to the pit looks like a funnel lined with sand.The rest of the time it looks like the entrance to a cave or lair.A creature coming within three feet of the edge of the entrance has a 20 % chance of slipping in the loose soil and sand and sliding into the pit.A creature entering the pit has a 50 % chance per round of sliding to the bottom.A character who takes precautions when approaching or entering the pit, such as securing himself to a tree with a rope, will not slip into the pit.</div><div>When a victim lands in the bottom of the pit, the ant lion bursts from its covering of sand and stones and attempts to grab its victim with its mandibles.If successful, the ant lion will not release its prey until either it or the prey is dead.The ant lion impales its victim with its barbs, crushes with its mandibles, then grinds its mandibles back and forth in a sawing motion, automatically inflicting Sd4 points of damage each round after the initial hit.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> Ant lions mate once per year in mid - summer. The male ant lion is drawn to the female by aromatic secretions she releases when entering her mating cycle.Only ant lions can smell these secretions.Once a male enters the female’s lair, she stops secreting, and the couple begin clicking their mandibles at each other.This ritual clicking lasts for three full days, during which time the couple neither sleeps nor eats.The clicking has a trance - like effect on the ant lions; even if attacked, it takes the ant lions 1 d4 rounds to break their trance and respond to an intruder. At the conclusion of the clicking ritual, the male fertilizes the female, then leaves her nest.Within a week, the female lays between one and four eggs and buries them in a hole in the floor. The young ant lions hatch in about six months, immediately burrowing away to construct lairs of their own.A young ant lion has 4 Hit Dice, but otherwise has all the abilities of an adult.It reaches full maturity in about a year.</div><div>The ant lion’s lair typically consists of its pit trap and a narrow passage leading to a large chamber where the ant lion sleeps and eats.Another passage, winding from this chamber to the surface, is used as an escape route.The ant lion also drags the remnants of its meals through this passage and conceals them outside; this is usually the only opportunity to encounter an ant lion out of its lair.Although ant lions do not collect treasure, there is a 30% chance that 1 d4 of the following items will be found in a lair from previous kills(roll 1 d20 to determine randomly):</div><div><table><tr><td>1-6</td><td>10-40 gp</td></tr><tr><td>7-10</td><td>5-20 pp</td></tr><tr><td>11-13</td><td>Shield *</td></tr><tr><td>14-17</td><td>Metal weapon *</td></tr><tr>18-19</td><td>Jewelry *</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>Miscellaneous item *</tf></tr></table><p>* 10 % chance the item is magical.Roll on the appropriate table in the Dungeon Master’s Guide or assign an item of relatively low value.</p></div></br><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Ant lions near civilized regions are considered dangerous predators.Rewards are often available for proof of their destruction.Ant lions eat any creature that falls into their pits, though they prefer giant insects, usually eating one or more giant ants per day.Ant lions have no commercial value, though farmers of some primitive cultures use their mandibles for plows.</div>",

        "Description": "<div>The carnivorous ape is a larger, stronger, and more aggressive relative of the gorilla.It lives in tropical jungles and plains, sometimes lairing in tall trees.</div><div>Carnivorous apes have broad shoulders, thick bodies covered with black hair, long arms, and short legs, Hooked black claws grow from their fingers and toes.They have light brown faces, flaring nostrils, and mouths full of long sharp teeth for shredding and ripping flesh from prey.Carnivorous apes walk on all fours, using the knuckles of their hands for support.They can also swing through the trees at 75 % of their normal movement rate.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Carnivorous apes have a fair intelligence and are very cunning.Owing to their keen senses, they gain a + 2 bonus to their surprise roll.They typically hide in trees and stalk their prey for miles, dropping down to attack when their victim pauses to drink from a stream or is otherwise off - guard.In plains or other areas devoid of trees, they hide in tall grasses and thick bushes, leaping at a victim from behind.Carnivorous apes attack by rearing on their hind legs, flailing with their massive arms, and snapping with their powerful jaws.If an ape strikes its opponent with both hands in the same round, it inflicts an additional 1 d8 points of rending damage.When a carnivorous ape defeats an opponent or wishes to frighten an intruder, it stands on its hind legs, beats its hands against its chest, and bellows thunderously.The sound of a bellowing ape has been known to panic the timid.</div><br/><div><b style=çolor:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> Carnivorous apes live in families ranging from two to 20 members with about twice as many females as males.A pregnant female gives birth in about nine months, An infant never leaves its mother for the first three years of its life, clinging tightly to her long hair and riding on her back wherever the family goes.The largest male serves as the leader, establishing the daily routine and defending the family from danger.The leader is occasionally challenged by younger males, the challenge resolved by a brutal but non - fatal wrestling match.The loser leaves the family in humiliation; a defeated challenger eventually joins another family, but a defeated leader remains alone, living out the rest of his life in bitterness.</div><div>Families do not have permanent lairs, but instead roam from place to place in their home range, an area of 10 - 20 square miles. The leader marks the boundaries of a family 's home range by scratching crude symbols in tree trunks or by spraying them with musk secreted from glands under his tongue.A family wanders constantly, never spending two consecutive nights in the same place.They keep the jewels, coins, and other treasures gathered in their travels in hollow trees or other secure locations.</div><div>A family eats its first meal of the day shortly after sunrise, The adult males do the hunting, dragging their prey back to the family for all to share.The meal is followed by a long nap for the adults and play time for the youngsters.The family has a second meal before sunset, then shortly after dark goes to sleep in a secluded meadow or in a communal nest constructed in the branches of the tallest trees.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Though aggressive by nature, carnivorous apes normally kill only for food or in defense of their families.They enjoy fruit and nuts, but most of their diet consists of rodents, small reptiles, eggs, and fish, as well as the occasional giant insect or carrion.Wild game supplements the family menu; antelope, buffalo, deer, and horses are among the apes’ favorite prey.In areas densely populated with wild game, carnivorous apes must sometimes compete with lions and other predators.It is not unusual for a pride of lions to violently challenge a family of carnivorous apes for hunting rights in disputed areas; the apes will usually relocate rather than risk the lives of their families.</div><div>The carnivorous ape’ s reputation as a man - eater is overrated. Although it is true that some eat humans exclusively, raiding villages and attacking hunting expeditions for prey, such families are rare.More common is the solitary man - eater, usually a frustrated ex - leader who attacks humans as much out of anger as hunger. Carnivorous apes are a favorite target for human sportsmen, who hunt them for trophies(pelts, hands, and heads).Additionally, certain primitive tribes mandate the killing of a carnivorous ape as a rite of passage.</div>",

        "Description": "<div>Baboons are large, herbivorous monkeys.They usually live in the trees of tropical and subtropical jungles, but tribes are sometimes found in tropical mountains and plains.</div><div>Baboons have dark brown fur, long arms and legs, and large heads with dog - like muzzles and sharp canine teeth.Most baboon tails are short and stubby, but some are as much as two feet long. A collar of gray fur encircles the necks of the largest males.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat: If the tribe 's home territory is entered, the baboons will try to drive the invaders off, but it is 90 % likely that a baboon tribe will flee if threatened or surprised, hiding in trees or behind ground foliage until the danger has passed.Extremely agile, baboons can climb at twice their normal movement in five-round bursts when fleeing from an enemy.However, if cornered or if an infant is endangered, baboons can be vicious fighters, particularly the larger males.Baboons attack by dropping on their victims from above or charging and leaping, biting with their sharp teeth for 1d4 points of damage.The tribe is led by 2d4 large males that serve as the first line of defense and receive a +1 damage bonus to their attacks.Male baboons sometimes attempt to discourage intruders by baring their fangs and screeching.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat / Society: Baboons live in tribes of 10 - 40, though some tribes include as many as 100 members.About half the tribe are juveniles or infants; the remainder are adult males and females. The young will not attack, and females generally attack only if their children are threatened, Females give birth to one child every year.</div><div>Baboons eat in the morning, nap during the afternoon, then rest at night after a final meal, sleeping in tree branches or on rocky cliffs.Though the males may roam several miles searching for food, they always return to the tribe before sundown, carrying fruit, nuts, and other food in pouches in their cheeks.Baboons are among the more intelligent primates, with excellent memories and an insatiable curiosity.They do not collect treasure.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology: Baboons eat fruit, seeds, grass, roots, and leaves. They also enjoy bird eggs and insects.When food is scarce, baboons will eat live prey, such as mice and frogs.Groups of large males have been known to chase down and kill small antelope and leopards, though this is extremely unusual, Given the opportunity, most predators will eat baboons.Since jungle baboons spend most of their time in the high trees, they are generally safe from attacks, Giant snakes are their most feared natural enemies. Mountain baboons have a harder time of it; their enemies include mountain lions, sabre - tooths, and wolf packs.</div><div>Men hunt baboons for their furry pelts and chewy but succulent meat.Baboon teeth are sometimes used for necklaces and other simple jewelry.If captured when young, baboons can be tamed as pets.Some primitive cultures consider baboons to be sacred and worship them as emissaries of the gods.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Banderlog</b></div><br/><div>Banderlogs resemble baboons with green skin and brown fur. They are somewhat stronger than baboons and are able to communicate in a simple language of chatters and grunts.Not as panic prone as baboons, banderlogs attack at close quarters with their long canine teeth for 1d4+1 points of damage, but are more likely to use coconuts or retch plant globes(the purple membranous fruit of retch plants, also know as globe palms) as missile weapons.Banderlogs will cling to tree branches with one hand and hurl missiles with the other at targets up to 30 feet away. Coconuts strike for 1d4+1 points of damage and retch plant globes burst to splash nauseating fluid over a five - foot radius with a 25 % chance for splash contact at a distance of 1 d6 + 3 feet(splashed creatures vomit and retch for three rounds, and their Strengths are reduced by half for the next hour; no saving throw allowed), Like baboons, banderlogs can climb for short bursts at twice their normal movement allowance.</div><div>Banderlogs are organized into small tribes led by one or more large males with 6 - 8 hp per die(+1 damage to attacks).They live in communal nests made of leaves in the highest branches of palm trees.They normally do not collect treasure, but there is 5% chance that a tribe has a piece of jewelry or some other random valuable item in their nest.Their diet is similar to that of baboons, occasionally supplemented by rodents and large insects. Lions and other carnivores prey on banderlogs, while hunters kill them to make furs from their pelts and jewelry from their teeth.</div>",

A badger snarls and salivates while attacking, and in most cases fights to the death.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> Badgers are extremely skilled burrowers.They prefer to dig their dens in the soft earth of forest floors and farmlands, but they can also thrive in mountains and hillsides, The entrance to a badger den is a circular hole about one to two feet in diameter, surrounded by a ring of soil from the original excavation.The tunnel angles gently into the earth, is usually about four to six feet long, and ends in a chamber that can be as small as four feet wide or as large as 10 feet wide, depending on the size of the family.The floor of the den is typically littered with remnants of previous meals and beds of leaves and grass for sleeping.Badgers are not particularly good housekeepers; if a den becomes excessively filthy, the family may relocate to a nearby area and dig new living quarters.</div><div>Badgers are not social animals, but they are extremely loyal to their mates and their families.Badgers are most typically encountered as either solitary creatures or as a mated pair.lf more thana pair is encountered, the rest are the pair 's offspring. A family reacts aggressively toward any strangers, including other badgers, invading the immediate territory of its den.</div><div>Male badgers hunt at night while the females remain in the den to care for their young.If a mated pair has no young, they often hunt together.Badgers bring captured prey back to their den and usually devour the entire creature, bones and all.When not hunting, badgers stay home.Badgers living in cold climates hibernate for most of the winter.Badgers do not collect treasure.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Badger flesh is greasy, tough, and not particularly appetizing.Because of their vicious nature, hunting badgers is not worth the trouble for most predators, although a hungry wolf or fox can occasionally be seen pawing the entrance to a badger den.Badgers eat rodents, squirrels, gophers, and other small animals.</div><div>Badger fur is sold commercially to make coats, gloves, and mufflers, A quality pelt brings as much as 10 - 30 gold pieces.Badger hair can be made into brushes. </div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Giant Badger</b></div><br/><div>There is a very rare variety of badger found in remote forests that grows to about twice the size of the common badger(about four feet long).It inflicts more damage when attacking, and it tends to be more aggressive.Its statistics are otherwise identical to those of the common badger.Its pelt is also more valuable.</div>",

        "Description": "<div>Giant beetles are similar to their ordinary counterparts, only thousands of times larger— insects with chewing mouthparts and hard wings that provide substantial armor protection.</div><div>As insects, beetles have two pairs of wings and three pairs of legs.Fortunately, the wings on a giant beetle cannot be used to fly, and in most cases, its six bristly legs do not enable it to move as fast as a fleeing man.The hard chitinous shells of several varieties of these beetles are brightly colored, and sometimes have value to art collectors.While these shells protect these beetles as well as plate mail armor, it is difficult to craft armor from them, and a skilled alchemist would need to be brought in on the job.</div><div>All beetles are basically unintelligent and always hungry.They feed on virtually any form of organic material, including other sorts of beetles.They taste by means of their antennae or feelers; if the substance is organic, the beetle then proceeds to grasp it with its mandibles, crush it up, and eat it.Because of this thorough grinding, nothing actually eaten by giant beetles can be revived in any manner short of a wish, Beetles do not hear or see well, relying primarily on taste and feel.</div><div>Except at noted below, giant beetles are not really social animals;those that are found near each other are competitors for the same biological niche, not part of any family unit.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Bombardier Beetle</b></div><br/><div>This beetle is usually found above ground in wooded areas.It feeds on offal and carrion primarily, gathering huge heaps of such material in which to lay its eggs.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> If this beetle is attacked or disturbed, there is a 50% chance each round that it will turn its rear toward its attacker and fire off an 8’ x 8 ' x 8’ cloud of reeking, reddish acidic vapor from its abdomen.This cloud causes 3 d4 points of damage per round to any creature within it.Furthermore, the sound caused by the release of the vapor has a 20 % chance of stunning any creature with a sense of hearing within a 15-foot radius, and a like chance for deafening any creature within the 15-foot radius that was not stunned.Stunning lasts for 2 d4 rounds, plus an additional 2 d4 rounds of deafness after stunning.Deafening lasts 2 d6 rounds.The giant bombardier can fire its vapor cloud every third round, but not more often than twice in eight hours.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'`>Ecology:</b> The bombardier action of this beetle is caused by the explosive mixture of two substances produced internally and then combined in a third organ.If a bombardier is killed before it has the opportunity to fire off both of its blasts, it is certainly possible to cut the creature open and retrieve these chemicals.The chemicals can then be combined to produce a small explosion, or to fire a projectile if the proper equipment isset up beforehand.</div><div>The chemicals also have value to an alchemist, who can use them in various preparations.These chemicals are worth 50 gp per dose.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Boring Beetle</b></div><br/><div>These beetles favor rotting wood and similar organic material upon which to feed, so they are usually found individually inside huge trees or en masse in unused tunnel complexes underground.</div></br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> The large mandibles of these creatures are capable of a rather powerful bite, inflicting up to 20 points of damage to the victim.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> These creatures are individually not of much greater intelligence than others of their kind, but it is rumored that groups develop a communal intelligence that generates a level of consciousness and reasoning ability approximating those of the human brain.This does not mean that each beetle has the intelligence of a human, but rather that collectively the entire nest has attained that level.In these cases, the beetles are apt to collect treasure and magical items from their victims.</div><br><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> In tunnel complexes, boring beetles grow molds, slimes, and fungi substances for food, starting such cultures on various forms of decaying vegetable and animal matter and wastes.This activity often relies on the intelligence granted by the colony as a whole.</div><div>One frequent fungi grown is the shrieker, which serves a dual role.Not only is the shrieker a tasty treat for the boring beetle, but it also functions as an alarm when other visitors have entered the fungi farm.The boring beetles are quick to react to these alarms, dispatching the invaders, sometimes eating them, but in any case gaining fresh organic matter on which the shrieker and other saprophytic plants can feed.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Fire Beetle</b></div><br/><div>The smallest of the giant beetles, fire beetles nevertheless are capable of delivering serious damage with their powerful mandibles.They are found both above and below ground, and are primarily nocturnal.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Despite its name, the fire beetle has no fire attacks whatsoever, relying instead on its large mandibles to inflict up to three times the damage of a dagger in a single attack.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Fire beetles have two special glands above their eyes and one near the back of their abdomens.These glands give off a red glow.For this reason they are highly prized by miners and adventurers, as this luminosity persists for 1 d6 days after the glands are removed from the beetle.The light shed illuminates a 10 - foot radius.</div><div>The light from these glands is \"cold\"—it produces no heat whatsoever.Many mages and alchemists are eager to discover the secret of this cold light, which could be not only safe, but economical: with no parts to heat up and burn out, such a light source could conceivably last forever.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Rhinoceros Beetle</b></div><br/><div>This uncommon monster inhabits tropical and subtropical jungles.It roams these regions searching for fruits and vegetation, crushing anything in its path.The horn of a giant rhinoceros beetle extends about six feet.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> The mandibles of this giant beetle inflict 3 d6 points of damage to anyone unfortunate enough to be caught in them;the tremendous horn is capable of causing 2 d8 points of damage by itself.</div><br><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> The shell of this jungle dweller is often brightly colored or iridescent.If retrieved in one piece, these shells are valuable to clerics of the Egyptian pantheon, who use them as giant scarabs to decorate temples and other areas of worship.It is a representation of this largest of all beetles that serves as the holy symbol for clerics of Apshai, the Egyptian god whose sphere of influence is said to include insects of every sort.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Stag Beetle</b></div><br/><div>These woodland dwelling beetles are very fond of grains and similar growing crops, so they sometimes become highly bothersome and raid cultivated lands.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Like other beetles, they have poor sight and hearing, but they will fight if attacked or attack if they encounter organic material they consider food.The giant stag beetle’ s two horns are usually not less than eight feet long;they inflict up to 10 points of damage each.</div><br><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> The worst damage from a stag beetle raid is that done to livestock, which is stampeded off or devoured by the giant beetles.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Water Beetle</div><br><div>The giant water beetle is found only in fresh water no less than 30 feet deep.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat: As they are voracious eaters, these beetles prey upon virtually any form of animal but will eat almost anything.Slow and ponderous on land, they move very quickly in water, Giant water beetles hunt food by scent and vibration.</div><br><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'> Water beetles sometimes inhabit navigable rivers and lakes, in which case they can cause considerable damage to shipping, often attacking and sinking craft toget at the tasty morsels inside.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> These beetles are air breathers, but manage to stay underwater for long periods of time by catching and holding a bubble of air beneath their giant wings and carrying it underwater, where it can be placed in a cave or other projection capable of holding the air.</div>",

They inhabit swamps, marshes, meres, or other dank places.</div><div>Bullywugs are covered with smooth, mottled olive green hide that is reasonably tough, giving them a natural AC of 6. They can vary in size from smaller than the average human to about seven feet in height.Their faces resemble those of enormous frogs, with wide mouths and large, bulbous eyes; their feet and hands are webbed.Though they wear no clothing, all bullywugs use weapons, armor, and shields if they are available, Bullywugs have their own language and the more intelligent ones can speak a limited form of the common tongue.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Bullywugs always attack in groups, trying to use their numbers to surround their enemies.Whenever they can, bullywugs attack with their hop, which can be up to 30 feet forward and 15 feet upward.When attacking with a hop, bullywugs add a +1 bonus to their attack(not damage) rolls, and double the damage if using an impaling weapon.This skill, combined with their outstanding camouflage abilities, frequently puts the bullywugs in an ideal position for an ambush(-2 penalty to opponent 's surprise rolls).</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> More intelligent than frogs, all bullywugs live in organized or semi - organized socially fascist groups, cooperating for the purpose of hunting and survival.They live primarily on fish and any other game, preferring a diet of meat.They are adept hunters and fisherman, and skilled in the use and construction of snares and nets.</div><div>Bullywug society is a savage one.Males are the dominant sex, and females exist only to lay eggs.Though females and young make up about one - half of any tribe, they count for little in the social order.The only signs of respect that bullywugs ever bestow are toward their leader and their bizarre frog god.The race is chaotic evil, and totally lacking in any higher emotions or feelings.</div><div>The leader of a bullywug community is a large individual with 8 hit points.Communities of 30 or more bullywugs have five subleaders(8 hp each) and a powerful leader(2 HD, 12+ hp, +1 to damage).Communities of 60 or more bullywugs have a chieftain(3 HD, 20 + hp, +2 to damage) and five subchieftains(2 HD, 12+ hp, +1 to damage).</div><div>All bullywugs favor dank, dark places to live, since they must keep their skin moist.Most bullywugs live in the open and maintain only loose territorial boundaries.Ordinary bullywugs do not deal with incursions into their territory very efficiently, but they kill and eat interlopers if they can.They hate their large relatives(advanced bullywugs, see below) with a passion, and make war upon them at every opportunity.Bullywugs prize treasure, though it benefits them little.They value coins and jewels, and occasionally a magical item can be found amongst their hoard.</div><div>On an individual level, bullywugs lack the greed and powerlust seen in the individuals of other chaotic races, such as orcs. Fighting among members of the same group, for example, is almost nonexistent.Some would say that this is because they lack the intelligence to pick a fight, and not from a lack of spite.The tribes are lead by the dominant male, who kills and eats the previous leader when it is too old to rule.This is one of the few instances when they fight among themselves.</div><br/><div><b style=çolor:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Bullywugs tend to disrupt ecosystems, rather than fill a niche in them.They do not have the intelligence to harvest their food supplies sensibly and will fish and hunt in an area until its natural resources are depleted, and then move on to a new territory.They hate men, and will attack them on sight, but fortunately prefer to dwell in isolated regions far from human beings.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Bullywug, Advanced</b></div><br/><div>A small number of bullywugs are larger and more intelligent than the rest of their kind.These bullywugs make their homes in abandoned buildings and caves, and send out regular patrols and hunting parties.These groups tend to be well equipped and organized, and stake out a regular territory, which varies with the size of the group.They are more aggressive than their smaller cousins, and will fight not only other bullywugs but other monsters as well.The intelligent bullywugs also organize regular raids outside their territory for food and booty, and especially prize human flesh.Since they are chaotic evil, all trespassers, including other bullywugs, are considered threats or sources of food.</div><div>For every 10 advanced bullywugs in a community, there is a 10 % chance of a 2 nd - level shaman being present.</div>",

        "Description": "<div>The crocodile is a large, dangerous predatory reptile native to tropical and subtropical climes.It spends most of its time submerged in swamps, rivers, or other large bodies of water.</div><div>The crocodile is one of the most feared and ugliest predators of the tropics.It has a long, squat body, ranging in size from a scant foot to well over ten feet long.Most mature specimens range from eight to 15 feet long, and some even larger.Many sages argue that crocodiles never stop growing.The crocodile has a Jong jaw filled with sharp, conical teeth.The powerful maw is superbly adapted for dragging prey beneath the water and dismembering it.Its four short legs are very powerful, and can propel the crocodile rapidly through the water and over the land.Its long tail is also very strong and is sometimes used on land to unbalance its foes.</div><div>The crocodile is covered with a tough horny hide, which blends in very well with the surrounding water.Its eyes and nose are placed so that when the crocodile floats, only they remain above water, enabling the beast to spot and ambush prey.The crocodile is adept at floating through the water and remaining quite still, presenting the illusion that it is nothing more than a floating log.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Ever voracious, hungry crocodiles will attack anything that looks edible, including men.They prefer to lie in wait for their prey(-2 penalty to opponent 's surprise roll), and are exceedingly sensitive to movements in the water.They have been known to swiftly and silently swim up to the shore and seize a man, dragging him below the surface of the water.They prefer to attack with their powerful jaws, causing 2 d4 points of damage, and lash with their tails for 1 d12 points of damage.Crocodiles will fight among themselves for any prey they seize in their jaws, sometimes tearing their victim to pieces.The only thing that can slow a crocodile is cold.They become slow and sluggish(reduced to 50 % of their normal movement) when the temperature falls below 40° F.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> Crocodiles sometimes congregate in large numbers, but they are not by nature sociable, nor do they cooperate in hunting.They have well - concealed lairs and will often drag their prey to their lairs before eating it.When a tasty morsel comes its way, a group of crocodiles will go into a feeding frenzy, each attempting to get a part of the feast.They hunt almost daily, primarily in the water, rarely on land.Their tastes are broad: fish, men, small mammals, aquatic birds, and even a careless lion has occasionally been known to fall into their grasp. Hungry crocodiles will sometimes upend boats to see what falls out.</div><div>Crocodiles mate once a year, and the female lays a clutch of about 60 eggs, carefully burying them in the sand.Unlike many other reptiles, the female carefully guard her eggs, protecting them from other predators.When the time comes for the eggs to hatch, the mother assists by digging the eggs out of the sand.The newly hatched young are thrown entirely on their own resources to survive, Very few of the young survive to maturity.</div><div>Swamps and rivers are not the only abode of the crocodile. In recent years there have been dreadful rumors that some of these reptiles have made their homes in the sewers of cities in tropical regions, living on waste and carrion.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> The crocodile is a formidable predator and has little competition for food from other water creatures. One of the few monsters that can compete with it is the dragonturtle.Even on the riverbanks it has little to fear from rival predators; most would prefer not to tangle with a crocodile. The only predator that the crocodile need fear is man, who hunts it for its tough hide, which can be transformed into a beautiful, gleaming leather. Crocodiles are also hunted to eliminate the danger that they represent to riverside communities.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Giant Crocodile</b></div><br/><div>These creatures are far rarer than their smaller cousins.They attain sizes from 21 to 30 feet long, and they also continue to grow until death.Giant crocodiles typically inhabit salt water or prehistoric settings, where they have been know to prey upon sharks, small whales, and small seagoing crafts, such as fishing boats.When attacking a small boat, their favorite technique is to ram it, attempting to capsize and smash it open with their huge jaws.They have been known to gorge upon the catch within the fishing boats, and then to swim away, leaving the fishermen unharmed.</div>",

On the shore, it is hunted by the ultimate predators— humans and demihumans—for its superb meat and hard chitinous shell, which is prized by some for making armor and shields.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Giant Crayfish</b></div><br/><div>The crayfish is essentially a freshwater lobster.lt has a similar multi - plated shell, numerous legs, eyes set on stalks, and two wicked pincers.The giant crayfish is muddy brown or sand colored, depending upon the color of the river bottom it inhabits.Some say that the giant crayfish, like the lobster, keeps growing as it gets older; certain sages even argue that the giant crayfish is really the same species as the ordinary crayfish, merely an extremely old specimen.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Like the crab, the crayfish prefers to ambush its prey(-2 penalty to opponent 's surprise roll). It sits quietly on the river bottom, waiting, and then rushes forth to seize its food in its pincers.The giant crayfish does not normally represent a danger to adventurers, since it inhabits only deep rivers and spends all of its time on the river bottom, It would therefore only attack adventurers who were swimming along the river bottom, and then only if they came within its range.An attack by a giant crayfish’s pincers inflicts 2 d6 points of damage.The crayfish prefers to drag its catch back to its watery lair and eat in peace.Its shell is very tough, giving the creature AC 4.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> The giant crayfish inhabits only wide and deep rivers, and feeds almost exclusively upon bottom - dwelling fish.Due to its great size, it can easily prey on such fish as sturgeon, carp, and large eels.It is voracious and spends most of its time hunting.On the whole it rarely crosses paths with adventurers, but it does compete with river fishermen.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> The giant crayfish is considered a delicacy by other creatures, which perhaps accounts for its rarity.Nixies especially prize the meat of the giant crayfish.Dragon turtles, giant snapping turtles, merrows, giant otters, gar, giant pike, and storm giants are just some of the monsters that hunt the giant crayfish.It is very far from being the top predator in its food chain, and must fight for its survival.</div>",

            <
            div > The doppleganger is a master of mimicry that survives by taking the shapes of men,
        demihumans,
        and humanoids.

        Dopplegangers are bipedal and generally humanoid in appear -
        ance.Their bodies are covered with a thick,
        hairless gray hide,
        which gives them a natural AC of 5,
        They are,
        however,
        rarely seen in their true forms.

        Combat: This monster is able to assume the shape of any hu -
            manoid creature between four and eight feet high.The dopple -
            ganger chooses a victim,
        duplicates his form,
        and then attempts to kill the original and assume his place.The doppleganger is able to use ESP and can imitate its victim with 90 % accuracy,
        even du -
        plicating the victim 's clothing and equipment. If unsuccessful in
        taking its victim 's place, the doppleganger attacks, relying on the
        ensuing confusion to make it indistinguishable trom its victim.A doppleganger is immune to sleep and charm spells and rolls all saving throws as
        if he was a 10 th - level fighter.

        Dopplegangers work in groups and act together to ensure that their attacks and infiltrations are successful.They are very intelli -
        gent and usually take the time to plan their attacks with care.If a group of the monsters spots some potential victims,
        the dopple -
        gangers often trail their targets,
        waiting
        for a good chance to strike,
        choosing their time and opportunity with care.They may wait until nightfall,
        or until their victims are alone,
        or even follow them to an inn.

        Habitat / Society: Dopplegangers are rumored to be artificial be -
            ings that were created long ago by a powerful wizard or godling.They were originally intended to be used as spies and assassins in
            an ancient,
        highly magical war.Their creator died long ago,
        but they live on,
        still working as spies
        for evil powers,
        thieves,
        and government,
        They have even been known to work as assassins.

        All dopplegangers belong to a single tribe.Although this is rare,
        groups of dopplegangers can be found anywhere at any time,
        and in unexpected locations.Working as a unit,
        they select a group of victims,
        such as a family or a group of travelers.Basi -
        cally lazy,
        dopplegangers find it easier to survive and live com -
        fortably by taking humanoid,
        and especially human,
        shape.They prefer to take the form of someone comfortably provided
        for,
        and shun assuming the form of hardworking peasants.Since they are
        only 90 % accurate in their mimicry,
        most dopplegangers are eventually discovered and driven out,
        and then forced once more to assume a new shape.

        Dopplegangers are found most often in their true forms in a dungeon or the wilderness.Groups oftenset up a lair in an area well - suited to ambush and surprise,
        patrolling a regular territory.These bands make a good living by attacking weak humanoid monsters or travelers and stealing their food and treasure.If food and treasure are scarce,
        they hire out to a powerful wizard or thieves’ guild.

        A doppleganger who has been hired to replace a specific person will plan its attack with special care,
        learning as much about the victim and his environment as it can.

        The dopplegangers’ weaknesses are greed and cowardice.They spend their lives in avid pursuit of gold and other wealth.If at -
        tacking a group of adventurers,
        for example,
        they often choose the richest - looking one to attack first.If they target a party of ad -
        venturers,
        the dopplegangers wait until the party is on the way out of the dungeon and heading back to town.Since they are cowardly,
        however,
        they prefer to take the easiest route toward riches.A doppleganger who chooses a rich adventurer avoids risks once the treasure is safely in hand,
        and retreats at the earliest opportunity,
        making some plausible excuse
        for separating from the human members of the group.They sometimes hire out as spies and assassins
        for money as well.

        Ecology: Dopplegangers are sophisticated and dangerous para -
            sites,
        living off the labors of others.They must also be reckoned with as clever and effective spies and assassins who can wreak po -
        litical mayhem in positions of power,
        Evil wizards have on rare occasions controlled entire kingdoms
        for short periods of time by replacing a king,
        prince,
        or councilor with a doppleganger. < /div>

        Possessing some of the most dangerous qualities of a lion and a brass dragon,
        the dragonne is a vicious and deadly hunter,
        and a threat to many who travel in warmer climates.

        From a distance,
        a dragonne looks much like a giant lion,
        with the one very notable exception of the pair of small,
        brass - colored wings that stretch from the creature 's shoulders. Llpon closer in-
        spection,
        other differences between the dragonne and its feline ancestor become apparent,
        too.The dragonne is covered with thick,
        brass - colored scales,
        much like a brass dragon,
        and its mane is much thicker and made of far coarser hair than a lion 's.
        The beast also possesses huge claws and fangs,
        and large eyes,
        usually brass - colored like its scales.Dragonnes do not have their
        own language.Instead,
        they speak the languages of brass dragons and sphinxes.

        Combat: Dragonnes usually attack first with their front claws,
        inflicting 1 d8 points of damage with eachset,
        and their terrible jaws,
        inflicting 3 d6 points of damage.This is usually enough to slay most of the creatures the dragonne encounters.If a dragonne is in combat with an especially deadly opponent,
        or is wounded in a battle with a lesser opponent,
        however,
        it will use its deadly ToOdr.

        A dragonne '’s roar causes weakness (due to fear) in all creatures
        within 120 feet of the monster,
        unless they roll successful saving throws vs.paralyzation.Those creatures that save are not af -
        fected,
        but those that fail to save lose 50 % of their Strength
        for 2 d6 rounds.Worse still,
        any creature within 30 feet of the dra -
        gonne when it roars are deafened
        for 2 d6 rounds.No save is pos -
        sible against the deafening aspect of the dragonne’ s roar,
        and all affected creatures cannot hear any sound and fight with a - 1 pen -
        alty to attack rolls(due to disorientation).

        The dragonne’ s roar is like a dragon 's breath weapon in that it
        can only be used three times a day.Creatures within the range of the dragonne 's roar must roll saving throws vs. fear each time
        they hear it.Once a creature is deafened,
        however,
        itcannot hear the dragonne’ s roar,
        and need not save against it,
        until the 2 d6 rounds of temporary deafness are over.

        Although a dragonne’ s wings are useful only
        for short periods of time,
        carrying the creature
        for only 1 - 3 turns at a time,
        the dra -
        gonne uses its wings very effectively in battle.If any creatures attempt to charge the dragonne or encircle it,
        the dragonne simply takes to the air and finds a more defensible position,
        The dra -
        gonne prefers not to fight in the air,
        as it is very slow and maneu -
        vers poorly compared to most flying creatures.It can fight with its claws and bite,
        and even its roar,
        when airborne,
        so it remains almost as deadly in the air as on the ground.

        Habitat / Society: Dragonnes prefer to dwell in rocky foothills and deserts.They take large,
        natural caves
        for their lairs and store their small amounts of treasure,
        usually taken from slain ad -
        venturers,
        in loose piles around their rocky homes.Their territo -
        ries are usually very large,
        as they generally inhabit desolate areas.

        They cannot bear the company of other dragonnes,
        and the creatures are found in pairs only during their brief mating season,
        late in the autumn.Dragonnes lay eggs,
        like their reptilian ances -
        tors,
        and only one egg is produced a year by any dragonne.The female raises this young dragonne
        for one year,
        after which time even a mother and her young will be unfriendly
        if they meet.Male dragonnes are always antagonistic toward each other,

        In fact,
        dragonnesget along with very few creatures,
        and are considered a menace by most sentient races.More than anything,
        however,
        dragonnes wish to be left alone to hunt.

        Ecology: The dragonne prefers herd animals like goats
        for food,
        especially since they don’ t fight back as fiercely as humans.It only attacks a human or demihuman
        for food
        if no other game is available.

        Dragonnes are not necessarily aggressive toward strangers,
        and the creature 's reputation as a mindless devourer of helpless
        travelers is more the product of ignorance than well - researched fact.A dragonne will almost always attack any creature that in -
        vades its lair or threatens its territory.This means that adventur -
        ers who stumble across a dragonne 's cave or settlers who decide
        to build in a dragonne’ s territory are often subject to fierce and immediate attack.Creatures not threatening the dragonne’ s lair or simply passing through its territory are usually left alone.Though the dragonne’ s intelligence is low,
        it can tell the difference between a harmless traveler and a potentially troublesome settler.

                Dryads are beautiful, intelligent tree sprites.They are as elusive as they are alluring, however, and dryads are rarely seen unless taken by surprise— or they wish to be spotted.

                The dryad 's exquisite features, delicate and finely chiseled, are
                much like an elf maiden’ s.Dryads have high cheek bones and am -
                ber, violet, or dark green eyes.A dryad’ s complexion and hair color changes with the seasons, presenting the sprite with natural camouflage.During the fall, a dryad 's hair turns golden or red,
                and her skin subtly darkens from its usual light tan to more closely match her hair color.This enables her to blend with the falling leaves of autumn.In winter, both the dryad s hair and skin are white, like the snows that cover the oak groves, When en -
                countered in a forest during fall or winter, a dryad is often mis -
                taken
                for an attractive maid, probably of elvish descent.No one would mistake a dryad
                for an elf maid during the spring and sum -
                mer, however.At these times of year, a dryad’ s skin is lightly tanned and her hair is green like the oak leaves around her.

                Dryads often appear clothed in a loose, simple garment.The clothing they wear is the color of the oak grove in the season they appear.They speak their own tongue, as well as the languages of elves, pixies, and sprites.Dryads can also speak with plants.

                Combat: Dryads are shy, nonviolent creatures.They rarely carry weapons, but they sometimes carry knives as tools.Though a dryad can use this as a weapon in a fight, she will not resort to using a knife unless seriously threatened.

                Dryads have the ability to
                throw a powerful charm person spell
                three times a day(but only once per round).This spell is so pow -
                erful that targets of the spell suffer a - 3 penalty to their saving throws.A Dryad always uses this spell
                if seriously threatened, at -
                tempting to gain control of the attacker who could help her most against his comrades, Dryads will only attempt to charm elves as a last resort because of their natural resistance to this type of spell.

                The dryad’ s use of her ability to charm is not limited to combat situations, however.Whenever a dryad encounters a male with a Charisma of 16 or more, she usually tries to charm him.Charis -
                matic victims of a dryad’ s attentions are taken to the tree sprite 's
                home, where the men serve as amorous slaves to their beautiful captors.There is a 50 % chance that a person charmed and taken away by a dryad will never
                return .If he does escape from the dry -
                    ad 's charms, it will be after 1d4 years of captivity.

                This tree sprite also has two other powers that are very useful in defense.Unless surprised, a dryad has the ability to literally step through a tree and then dimension door to the oak tree she is part of.She can also speak with plants(as the 4 th - level priest spell).This enables the dryad to gather information about parties traveling near her tree, and even to use vegetation to hinder po -
                tential attackers.

                Habitat / Society: Some legends claim that dryads are the ani -
                mated souls of very old oak trees.Whether this is really the
                case,
                it is true that dryads are attached to a single, very large oak tree in
                their lifetimes and cannot,
                for any reason, go more than 360 yards from that tree.If adryad does wander farther away, she be -
                comes weak and dies within 6 d6 hours unless returned to her home.The oak trees of dryads do not radiate magic, but someone
                finding a dryad’ s home has great power over her.A dryad suffers damage
                for any damage inflicted upon her home tree.Any attack ona dryad 's tree will, of course, bring on a frenzied defense by the
                dryad.

                Although dryads are generally very solitary, up to six have been encountered in one place.This is rare, however.All this re -
                ally means is that anumber of dryad oaks are within 100 yards of one another and the dryads’ paths cross.These dryads may come to each other 's aid, but never really gather socially. Any treasure
                owned by a tree sprite is hidden close to her home tree.The gold and gems that make up a dryad 's treasure are almost always the
                gifts of charmed adventurers.

                These tree sprites realize that most humans and demihumans fear them
                for their ability to charm, so dryads only deal with strangers on rare occasions.When approached carefully, how -
                ever, dryads have been known to aid adventurers.They are a use -
                ful source of information, too, as they know a great deal about the area in which they live.

                Ecology:
                    Dryads are staunch protectors of the forest and groves in which they reside.Any actions that harm the area, and espe -
                    cially its plant life, are met with little tolerance.

                    Dwarves are a noble race of demihumans who dwell under the earth, forging great cities and waging massive wars against the forces of chaos and evil.Dwarves also have much in common with the rocks and gems they love to work,
                    for they are both hard and unyielding.It’ s often been said that it 's easier to make a stone
                    weep than it is to change a dwarf 's mind.

                    Standing from four to 41 / 2 feet in height, and weighing 130 to 170 pounds, dwarves tend to be stocky and muscular.They have ruddy cheeks and bright eyes.Their skin is typically deep tan or light brown.Their hair is usually black, gray, or brown, and worn long, though not long enough to impair vision in any way.They favor long beards and mustaches, too.Dwarves value their beards highly and tend to groom them very carefully.Dwarves do
                        not favor ornate stylings or wrappings
                    for their hair or their beards.

                    Dwarven clothing tends to be simple and functional.They of -
                    ten wear earth tones, and their cloth is considered rough by many other races, especially men and elves.Dwarves usually wear one or more pieces of jewelry, though these items are usually not of any great value or very ostentatious.Though dwarves value gems and precious metals, they consider it in bad taste to flaunt wealth.

                    Because dwarves are a sturdy race, they add 1 to their initial Constitution ability scores.However, because they are a solitary people, tending toward distrust of outsiders and other races, they subtract 1 from their initial Charisma ability scores.Dwarves usually live from 350 to 450 years.

                    Dwarves have found it useful to learn the languages of many of their allies and enemies.In addition to their own languages,
                    dwarves often speak the languages of gnomes, goblins, kobolds,
                    orcs, and the common tongue, which is frequently used in trade negotiations with other races.

                    Combat; Dwarves are courageous, tenacious fighters who are ill - disposed toward magic.Dwarves never use magical spells or train as wizards, though they can become priests and use the spells of this group.Because of their nonmagical nature, in fact,
                    dwarves get a special bonus to all saving throws against magical wands, staves, rods, and spells.Dwarves receive a + 1 bonus to saving throws against these magical attacks
                    for every 31 / 2 points of Constitution score they have.See Table 9 on page 21 of the Player 's Handbook for specific bonuses.

                    A dwarf 's nonmagical nature can also cause problems when he
                    tries to use a magical item.In fact,
                    if a dwarf uses a magical item that is not specifically created
                    for his class, there is a 20 % chance the item malfunctions.For example,
                    if a dwarven fighter uses a bag of holding— which can be used by any class, not just fighters— there is a 20 % chance each time the dwarf uses it that the bag does not work properly.This chance of malfunction ap -
                    plies to rods, staves, wands, rings, amulets, potions, horns,
                    jewels, and miscellaneous magic.However, dwarves have learned to master certain types of magical items because of the items’ military natures.These objects— specifically weapons,
                    shields, armor, gauntlets, and girdles— are not subject to magical malfunction when used by a dwarf of any class.

                    As with magical attacks, dwarves are unusually resistant to toxic substances.Because of their exceptionally strong Constitu -
                    tions, all dwarves roll saving throws against poisons with the same bonus(+1
                        for every 31 / 2 points of Constitution score) that applies to saves vs, magical attacks.

                    In the thousands of years that dwarves have lived in the earth,
                    they have developed a number of skills and special abilities that help them to survive.All dwarves have infravision that enables them to see up to 60 feet in the dark.When underground,
                    dwarves can tell quite a bit about their location by looking care -
                    fully at their surroundings.When within ten feet of what they are looking
                    for, dwarves can detect the grade and slope of a passage(1 - 5 on 1 d6), new tunnel construction(1 - 5 on 1 d6), sliding /
                    shifting walls or rooms(1 - 4 on 1 d6), and stonework traps, pits,
                    and deadfalls(1 - 3 on 1 d6).Dwarves can also determine their ap -
                    proximate depth underground(1 - 3 on 1 d6) at any time.

                    During their time under the earth, dwarves have also devel -
                    oped an intense hatred of many of the evil creatures they com -
                    monly encounter.Thus, in melee, dwarves always add 1 to their attack rolls to hit orcs, half - orcs, goblins, and hobgoblins.The small size of dwarves is an advantage against ogres, trolls, ogre magi, giants, and titans; these monsters always subtract 4 from their attack rolls against dwarves because of that size difference and the dwarves’ training in fighting such large foes.Dwarf

                    Dwarven armies are well - organized and extremely well -
                    disciplined.Dwarven troops usually wear chain mail and carry shields in battle.They wield a variety of weapons.The composi -
                    tion of a typical dwarven army by weaponry is axe and hammer(25 % ), sword and spear(20 % ), sword and light crossbow(15 % ),
                    sword and pole arm(10 % ), axe and heavy crossbow(10 % ), axe and mace(10 % ), or hammer and pick(10 % ).

                    For every 40 dwarves encountered, there is a 2 nd - to 6 th - level fighter who leads the group.(Roll 1 d6 to determine level, with a roll of 1 equalling 2.) If there are 160 or more dwarves encoun -
                    tered, there are, in addition to the leaders of the smaller groups,
                    one 6 th - level fighter(a chief) and a 4 th - level fighter(lieutenant) commanding the troops.If 200 or more dwarves are encountered,
                    there is a fighter / priest of 3 rd - to 6 th - level fighting ability and 4 th - to 7 th - level priest ability.If a dwarven army has 320 or more troops in it, the following high - level leaders are in command of the group: an 8 th - level fighter, a 7 th - level fighter, a 6 th - level fighter / 7 th - level priest, and two 4 th - level fighter / priests.

                    The commanders of the dwarven troops wear plate armor and carry shields.In addition, the fighters and fighter / priests leading the dwarven troops have a 10 % chance per level of fighting abil -
                    ity of having magical armor and / or weapons.The fighter / priests who lead the troops also have a 10 % chance per level of priest ability of having a magical item specific to priests(and thus not subject to malfunction).

                    If encountered in its home, a dwarven army has, in addition to the leaders noted above, 2 d6 fighters of from 2 nd - to 5 th - level(1 d4 + 1
                        for level), 2 d4 fighter / priests of from 2 nd - to 4 th - level( in
                        each class), females equal to 50 % of the adult males, and children equal to 25 % of the adult males, Dwarven women are skilled in
                    combat and fight as males
                    if their home is attacked.

                    Habitat / Society: Usually constructed around profitable mines,
                    dwarven cities are vast, beautiful complexes carved into solid stone, Dwarven cities take hundreds of years to complete, but once finished they stand
                    for millennia without needing any type of repair.Since dwarves do not leave their homes often and al -
                        ways
                    return to them, they create their cities with permanence in
                        mind.Troops guard dwarven cities at all times, and sometimes(60 % chance) dwarves also use animals as guards— either 2 d4
                    brown bears(75 % chance) or 5 d4 wolves(25 % chance).

                    Dwarven society is organized into clans.A dwarven clan not already attached to a city or mine travels until it finds an outpost where it can begin to ply a trade.Clans often settle close together since they usually need the same raw materials
                    for their crafts.Clans are competitive, but usually do not war against one an -
                        other.Dwarven cities are founded when enough clans move to a
                    particular location,

                    Each dwarven clan usually specializes in a particular craft or skill; young dwarves are apprenticed at an early age to a master in
                    their clan(or, occasionally, in another clan) to learn a trade.Since dwarves live so long, apprenticeships last
                    for many years.Dwarves also consider political and military service a skilled trade, so sol -
                    diers and politicians are usually subjected to a long period of ap -
                    prenticeship before they are considered professionals.

                    To folk from other races, life within these cities might seem as rigid and unchanging as the stone that the dwarven houses are wrought from.In fact, it is.Above all, dwarves value law and or -
                    der.This love of stability probably comes from the dwarves long life spans,
                    for dwarves can watch things made of wood and other mutable materials decay within a single lifetime.It shouldn 't be
                    surprising, then, that they value things that are unchanging and

                    toil ceaselessly to make their crafts beautiful and long - lived.For a dwarf, the earth is something to be loved because of its stability and the sea a thing to be despised— and feared— because it is a symbol of change.

                    Dwarves also prize wealth, as it is something that can be devel -
                    oped over a long period of time.All types of precious metal, but particularly gold, are highly prized by dwarves, as are diamonds and other gems.Dwarves do not value pearls, however, as they
                    are reminders of the sea and all it stands
                    for.Dwarves believe,
                    however, that it is in poor taste to advertise wealth, Metals and gems are best counted in secret, so that neighbors are not of -
                    fended or tempted.

                    Most other races see dwarves as a greedy, dour, grumpy folk who prefer the dampness of a cave to the brightness of an open glade.This is partially true, Dwarves have little patience
                    for men and other short - lived races(since man 's concerns seem so petty
                        when seen from dwarven eyes).Dwarves also mistrust elves be -
                    cause they are not as serious - minded as dwarves and waste their long lives on pastimes the dwarves see as frivolous.However,
                    dwarves have been known to band together with both men and elves in times of crisis, and long - term trade agreements and alli -
                    ances are common.

                    Dwarves have no mixed feelings about the evil races that dwell below ground and in the Underdark, however.They have an in -
                    tense hatred of orcs, goblins, evil giants, and drow.The dire crea -
                    tures of the Underdark often fear dwarves, too,
                    for the short,
                    stout folk are tireless enemies of evil and chaos.It is a goal of the dwarves to wage constant and bitter war against their enemies under the earth until either they or their foes are destroyed.

                    Ecology: Since much of their culture is focused on creating things from the earth, dwarves produce a large amount of useful,
                    valuable trade material.Dwarves are skilled miners.Though they rarely sell the precious metals and rough gems they uncover,
                    dwarven miners have been known to sell surpluses to local hu -
                    man communities.Dwarves are also skilled engineers and master builders— though they work almost exclusively with stone— and some dwarven architects work
                    for humans quite frequently.

                    Dwarves most often trade in finished goods.Many clans are dedicated to work as blacksmiths, silversmiths, goldsmiths, ar -
                    morers, weapons makers, and gem cutters.Dwarven products are highly valued
                    for their workmanship.In human communi -
                    ties, these goods often demand prices up to 20 % higher than lo -
                    cally forged items.Many people are still willing to pay a high price
                    for a suit of dwarven mail or a dwarven sword.Humans know that the dwarf who forged the item made it to last a dwar -
                    ven lifetime, so they 'll never need to worry about it wearing out in theirs.

                    Mountain Dwarves

                    Similar in most ways to their cousins, the hill dwarves, these de -
                    mihumans prefer to live deep inside mountains.They tend to be slightly taller than hill dwarves(averaging 4!/z feet tall) and more
                        hearty(having 1 + 1 Hit Dice), They usually have slightly lighter skin and hair than their hill - dwelling relatives.In battle, moun -
                        tain dwarf armies are likely to have more spears(30 % maximum) and fewer crossbows(20 % maximum) than hill dwarf armies.Mountain dwarves have the same interests and biases as hill dwarves, though they are even more isolationist than their cous -
                        ins and sometimes consider even hill dwarves to be outsiders.Mountain dwarves live
                        for at least 400 years.

                            The duergar, or gray dwarves, are a malevolent breed that dwells in the extreme depths of the ground.Duergar may be fighters,
                            priests, or thieves, Multi - classed duergar may be fighter / priests,
                            fighter / thieves, or priest / thieves.Thief duergar are proficient in
                            the use of poison.

                            Duergar appear to be emaciated, nasty - looking dwarves.Their complexion and hair range from medium to dark gray.They pre -
                            fer drab clothing designed to blend into their environment.In their lair, they may wear jewelry, although such pieces are kept dull.

                            Duergar have infravision with a range of 120 feet.They speak the duergar dialect of the dwarven tongue, “undercommon”(the trading language of subterranean cultures), and the silent speech employed by some subterranean creatures.Intelligent duergar may speak other languages as well.

                            Combat: For every four normal, 1 - HD duergar encountered outside a lair, there is one with 2 HD + 4 hp.If a band of nine duergar is encountered outside a lair, a tenth duergar of 3 HD + 6 hp or 4 HD + 8 hp always leads the group.

                            Duergar are armed as follows:

                            2 nd level: pick, light crossbow, chain mail, and shield

                            There are noncombatant duergar children equal to 10 % of the total number of duergar fighters encountered.

                            Duergar possess the normal dwarven abilities to detect slope,
                            new construction, sliding walls, traps, and depth underground.They have the dwarven combat advantages when fighting such creatures as ogres, trolls, ogre magi, giants, and titans.They do
                                not gain the dwarven advantage when fighting orcs, half - orcs,
                                goblins, and hobgoblins, since duergar are not inherently hostile
                            toward such races.

                            The duergar diet is an omnivorous mix of fungi, insects, and subterranean animals, Duergar complexes include caverns used as fungus farms that are filled with giant, edible mushrooms.They brew a potent ale from such mushrooms.

                            Ecology: Duergar detest the other dwarven races, whom they consider pampered, weak, and self - indulgent.They may ally and even share living space with evil dwarves, but the duergar 's hos-
                            tile nature makes such alliances extremely rare.

                            Duergar tend to see intruders as invaders.Even
                            if trespassers

                            can convince the duergar of their peaceful intentions, the duergar may demand a stiff toll to permit safe passage.Even then, duergar may discreetly follow the travelers to see what they are up to and,
                            if treasure is involved, to steal such riches
                            for themselves.Duergar rarely bother surface - dwellers due to their disadvan -
                            tages on the surface.When encountered on the surface, such dwarves are usually on a mission or part of a raiding party.

                            Steeders

                            Steeders are immense tarantulas used as mounts by the duergar.The duergar ride on leather saddles and use a complex series of prods and straps to control the monsters.

                            Only steeders of 20 or more hp are used as mounts.

                            A steeder lacks a poisonous bite; it attacks with its sharp man -

                                which) with a - 10 penalty.While held, victims suffer a - 2 penalty to attack and damage rolls.

                        Combat: An eagle uses its claws and beak

                        for eagles.Once an eagle builds a nest, it will keep that home, adding it with each passing season, until the nest is destroyed or the eagle dies.There is always a 50 % chance that 1 d4 eggs are present in a nest.If eggs are not present, there is a 20 % chance that 1 d4 young eagles are present instead.There is always a 10 % chance that the eagle is storing some small, shiny objects in the nest(like gold coins or gems).

                        Eagles are usually encountered alone or in pairs.Eagles mate

                        for eaglets and eagle eggs means that each one captured brings a price of 60 to 100 gold.Eagle feathers and other eagle tokens are also valued highly by many adventurers, as they wrongly believe the eagle 's

                        ertheless, nature has provided the various types of eels with interesting— and dangerous— methods of detense.

                        Electric Eels

                        Reaching nine feet in length, the electric eel has a long, scaleless body.The eel swims using its two small pectoral fins and the long fin that stretches along 80 % of its stomach, and is able to propel itself rapidly in any direction including backward.The coloration of an electric eel is mostly dull gray, though it often has a bright patch of red or green along its stomach and throat.

                        Combat; An attacking eel, whether in self - defense or hunting
                        for food, will discharge a jolt of electricity.This charge has a 15 -
                        foot - radius range.Creatures less than five feet from the eel suffer 3 d8 points of damage: creatures five to ten feet away receive 2 d8 points of damage: all other creatures within range suffer 1 d8 points of damage.An eel must recharge itself
                        for an hour(six turns) between attacks.

                        If hunting, an eel will search the surrounding water
                        for fish,
                        frogs, or other creatures that are easily stunned or killed by its at -
                        tack.As it has no teeth, an electric eel eats only small creatures it can swallow whole.If defending itself, an eel will seek to flee its attackers
                        while they are recovering from the electric charge.The electric eel is immune to all electricity - based attacks.

                        Habitat / Society: Shallow, slow - moving, fresh water rivers in
                        the warmer climates are the abodes of the electric eel.Not a social animal, the electric eel lives a solitary lite when it is not breeding.However, when an eel discharges electricity, there is an 80 %
                        chance that 1 - 2 other nearby eels approach in the hope of securing something to eat.

                        Giant Eels

                        Weed Eels

                        These eels get their name from their remarkable resemblance to seaweed.In fact, they can be spotted by a trained observer only on a roll of 1 on 1 d6.The bite of the weed eel is poisonous— victims that fail a saving
                        throw vs.poison die in 1 d4 rounds.

                        Weed eels are at home in both fresh and salt water, 25 to 40 feet deep.They live in loose, communal groups of 10 to 60 eels.Each colony has a lair consisting of an central cave, roughly 30 feet long and 20 feet wide and high.The floor of the central cave is covered with small stones, coins, and gems that the eels have scavenged, Radiating from this central cave are a series of six -
                        foot - diameter tunnels, which in turn lead to a network of six - to eight - inch - diameter holes.These are the homes of the individual eels that make up the colony.Weed eels are fiercely protective of their lairs, especially the central cave where their young are raised.Elf, Drow

                        These dreaded, evil creatures were once part of the community of elves that still roam the world 's forests. Now these dark elves in-
                        habit black caves and winding tunnels under the earth, where they plan dire schemes against the races that still walk upon the green earth under the sun.

                        Drow have black skin and pale, usually white hair.They are shorter and more slender than men, seldom reaching more than five feet in height.Male drow weigh between 90 and 120 pounds,
                        and females weigh between 70 and 100 pounds.Drow have finely chiseled features, and their fingers and toes are long and delicate.Like all elves, they have higher Dexterity and lower Constitution than men.

                        Drow clothing is usually black, functional, and often possesses special properties— though it does not radiate magic.For exam -
                        ple, drow cloaks and boots act as
                        if they are cloaks of eluenkind and boots of elvenkind, except that the wearer is only 75 % likely to remain undetected in shadows or to surprise enemies.The ma -
                        terial used to make drow cloaks does not cut easily and is ftire -
                        resistant, giving the cloaks a + 6 bonus to saving throws vs.fire.These cloaks and boots only fit or
                        function
                        for those of elven size and build.Any attempted alteration of a drow cloak has a 75 %
                        chance of unraveling the material, which is then useless.

                        In the centuries they 've spent underground, drow have learned
                        the languages of many of the intelligent creatures of the under -
                        world, Besides their own tongue— a strange version of elvish— drow speak both common and the subterranean trade language used by many races under the earth.They speak the languages of gnomes and other elves fluently.

                        Drow also have their own silent language composed of both hand movements and body language.With their long, delicate fingers, drow are able to create a large number of signs.These signs can convey information, but not subtle meaning or emo -
                        tional content, If drow are within 30 feet of each other, they also use complex facial expressions, body movements, and postures to convey meaning.Coupled with the hand signs, these expressions and gestures give the drow’ s silent language a potential
                        for expres -
                        sion equal to most spoken languages.





                        Combat: The drow’ s world is one in which violent conflict is part of everyday life.It should not be surprising, then, that most drow encountered, whether alone or in a group, are ready to fight.Also, those drow that are encountered outside of a drow city— almost all drow that adventurers ever meet— are at least 2 nd - level tighters.(See Society note below.)

                        All drow wear finely crafted, non - encumbering, black mesh ar -
                        mor.This extremely strong mail is made with a special alloy of steel containing adamantite.The special alloy, when worked by a drow armorer, yields mail that has the same properties of chain mail + ] to + 5, though it does not radiate magic.Even the lowli -
                    est drow fighters have, in effect, chain mail + 1,
                    while higher level drow have more finely crafted, and therefore more powerful,
                    mail.(The armor usually has a + 1
                        for every four levels of experi -
                        ence of the drow wearing it.)

                    Dark elves also carry small shields(bucklers) fashioned of ada -
                    mantite.Like drow armor, these special shields may be + 1, +2,
                    or even + 3, though only the most important drow fighters have +
                    3 bucklers.

                    Most drow carry a long dagger and a short sword of adaman tite alloy, These daggers and swords can have a + 1 to + 3 bonus,
                    and drow nobles may have daggers and swords of + 4 bonus.Some drow(50 % ) also carry small crossbows.These can be held in one hand and shoot darts up to 60 yards.These darts only in -
                    flict 1 - 3 points of damage, but dark elves commonly coat them with a special poison that renders a victim unconscious unless he rolls a successful saving
                    throw vs.poison, with a - 4 penalty.The
                    effects of the poison last 2 d4 hours.

                    A few drow carry adamantite maces(+1 to + 5 bonus) instead of blades.Others carry small javelins coated with the same poi -
                    son as the darts.These have a range of 90 yards and have a + 3 bonus at short range, a + 2 at medium, anda + 1 at long

                    Drow move silently and have superior infravision(120 feet) They also have the same intuitive senses about their underground world as dwarves do,
                    and can detect secret doors with the same chances of success as other elves.Only ona roll of 1 on 1 d10 is a dark elf surprised by an opponent.

                    All dark elves receive training in magic, and all drow are able to use the following spells once per day: dancing lights, faerie fire, and darkness.Drow above 4 th level can also use / evitate Elf, Drow

                    know alignment, and detect magic once per day.Drow priests can also use clairvoyance, detect lie, suggestion, and dispel magic once per day.

                    Perhaps it is the common occurrence of magic in drow society that has given the dark elves their incredible resistance to magic.All drow have a base magic resistance of 50 % , which increases by 2 %
                    for each level of experience the drow gains.(Multi - classed drow gain the bonus from only the class in which they have the highest level.) All drow also save vs.all forms of magica] attack(including devices) with a + 2 bonus.Thus,
        a 5 th - level drow has a 60 % base magic resistance and a + 2 bonus to his saving throws vs.any spells that manage toget past the magic resistance.

        Drow encountered in a group always have a leader of higher level than the rest of the elves.If ten or more drow are encoun -
        tered,
        a fighter / mage of at least 3 rd level in each class is leading them.If 20 dark elves are encountered,
        then in addition to the higher level fighter / mage,
        there is a fighter / priest of at least 6 th level in both classes.If more than 30 drow are encountered,
        up to 50 % are priests and the leader is at least a 7 th - level fighter / 8 th -
        level priest,
        with a 5 th - level fighter / 4 th - level mage
        for an assist -
        ant,
        in addition to the other higher level leaders noted above.

        Dark elves do have one great weakness— bright light.Because
        the drow have lived so long in the earth,
        rarely venturing to the surface world,
        they are no longer able to tolerate bright light of any kind,
        Drow within the radius of a light or continual light spell are 90 % likely to be seen.In addition,
        they lose 2 points from their Dexterity and attack with a - 2 penalty when inside the area of these spells.Those subject to spells cast by drow affected by a light or continual light spell add a + 2 bonus to their saving throws.If drow are attacking a target that is in the area of effect of a light or continual light spell,
        the drow suffer an additional - 1 penalty to their attack rolls,
        and targets of drow magical attacks save at an additional + 1. These penalties are cumulative(i.e.,
            if both the drow and their targets are in the area of effect of a light spell, the drow suffer a - 3 penalty to their attack rolls and the tar -
            gets gain a + 3 bonus against drow spells).

        Because of the serious negative effects strong light has on drow,
        they are 75 % likely to leave an area of strong illumination unless they are in battle,
        Light sources,
        such as torches,
        lanterns,
        magi -
        cal weapons,
        or faerie fire spells,
        do not affect drow.

        Habitat / Society: Long ago,
        dark elves were part of the elven race that roamed under the sun in the world’ s forests.Not long af -
        ter they were created,
        though,
        the elves found themselves torn into rival factions— one favoring the tenets of evil,
        the other holding to the ideals of good(or at least neutrality).A great civil war between the elven folk followed soon after,
        and the selfish elves who followed the path of evil and chaos were driven into the depths of the earth,
        into the bleak,
        lightless caverns and tunnels of the underworld.These dark elves became the drow.

        The drow no longer wish to live upon the earth.In fact,
        few who live under the sun ever see a drow.But the dark elves resent the elves and faeries who drove them away,
        and they frequently plot against the creatures that dwell upon the surface.

        Drow live in magnificently dark and gloomy cities in the un -
        derworld that few humans or demihumans ever see.Dark elves construct their buildings entirely of stone and minerals,
        carved into weird,
        fantastic shapes.Those few surface creatures that have seen a dark elf city(and returned to tell the tale) report that it is the stuff of which nightmares are made.

        Drow society is fragmented into many opposing noble houses and merchant families,
        all scrambling
        for power.In fact,
        all drow carry brooches inscribed with the symbol of the merchant or no -
        ble group they are aligned with,
        though they hide these and do
            not show them often.Dark elves firmly believe that the strongest
        should rule;their rigid class system,
        complete with a long and complicated list of titles and prerogatives,
        is based on this idea.

        Drow worship a dark goddess,
        called Lolth by some,
        and dark elf priests hold a very high place in society.Also,
        since most drow priests are female,
        women tend to fill many positions of great im -
        portance,

        Drow fighters go through rigorous training
        while they are still young.Those who fail the required tests at the program 's conclu-
        sion are put to death.This is why no dark elf fighter of less than 2 nd level is usually seen outside a drow city.

        Drow often use giant lizards as pack animals,
        and they fre -
        quently have bugbears or troglodytes as servants.Drow cities are havens
        for evil creatures,
        including mind flayers,
        and drow have alliances with many of the underworld’ s evil inhabitants.On the other hand,
        drow are constantly at war with many of their neigh -
        bors under the earth,
        including dwarves or dark gnomes(svirtneblin) who happen to move to close to a drow city.Dark elves frequently keep slaves of all types,
        including past allies who have failed to live up to drow expectations.

        Ecology: As noted earlier,
        drow produce unusual weapons and clothing with quasi - magical properties.Some scribes and re -
        searchers suggest that it is the strange radiation often detected around drow cities that make drow crafts special,
        Others theorize that it is the drow’ s fine workmanship that gives their wonder -
        fully strong metals and superior cloth unique attributes.What -
        ever the reason,
        it’ s clear that the drow have discovered some way to make their clothing and weapons without the use of magic.

        Direct sunlight utterly destroys drow cloth,
        boots,
        weapons,
        and armor.When any item produced by dark elves is exposed to the light of the sun,
        irreversible decay begins.Within 2 d6 days,
        the items lose their magical properties and decay,
        becoming to -
        tally worthless,
        Drow artifacts protected from sunlight retain their special properties
        for 1 d20 + 30 days before becoming nor -
        mal items.Any drow item that is protected from direct sunlight and exposed to the strange radiations of the drow underworld one week out of every four will retain its properties indefinitely.

        Drow sleep poison,
        used on their darts and javelins,
        is highly prized by traders on the surface world.However,
        this poison loses its potency instantly when exposed to sunlight,
        and remains effective
        for only 60 days after it is exposed to air.Drow poison remains potent
        for a year
        if inan unopened packet.

        Driders

        These strange creatures have the head and torso of a drow and the legs and lower body of a giant spider,
        Driders are created by the drow 's dark goddess. When a dark elf of above-average ability
        reaches 6 th level,
        the goddess may put him or her through a spe -
        cial test.Those that fail become driders,
        keeping only a sexless,
        bloated version of their body 's upper half.

        All driders are able to cast the spells that normal drow can use once per day.Driders also retain the magical or clerical abilities they possessed before their weird transformation.A majority of driders(60 % ) were priests of 6 th or 7 th level before they were changed.(Remember that drow priests, and therefore driders that were priests, can also use clairvoyance, detect lie, suggestion, and dispel magic once per day.) All other driders were once mages of 6 th,
        7 th,
        or 8 th level.

        Driders always fight as 7 - Hit Die monsters.They often use swords or axes,
        though many carry bows.Driders can bite
        for 1 d4 points of damage,
        and those bitten must roll successful saving throws vs.poison with a - 2 penalty or be paralyzed
        for 1 - 2 turns.

        Because they have failed their goddess’ s test,
        driders are out -
        casts from the dark elves’ communities.Driders are usually found alone or with 2 d6 huge spiders(10 % chance) rather than with drow or other driders.They are violent,
        aggressive creatures that favor blood over all types of food.They stalk their victims tire -
        lessly,
        waiting
        for the right chance to strike.

            MORALE: Elite(13) XP VALUE: 975

            Ettercaps are ugly bipedal creatures that get along very well with all types of giant spiders.These creatures of low intelligence are exceedingly cruel, very cunning, and are skilled in setting traps— very deadly traps— much like the spiders that often live around them.

            Ettercaps stand around six feet tall, even with their stooping gait and hunched shoulders.The creatures have short, spindly legs, long arms that reach nearly to their ankles, and large pot -
            bellies.The hands of ettercaps have a thumb and three long fin -
            gers that end in razor sharp claws.Their bodies are covered by tufts of thick, wiry, black hair, and their skin is dark and thick.Et -
            tercaps’ heads are almost equine in shape, but they have large rep -
            tilian eyes, usually blood - red in color, and large fangs, one protruding downward from each side of the mouth.The mouth itself is large and lined with very sharp teeth.

            Ettercaps do not have a formal language.They express them -
                selves through a combination of high - pitched chittering noises,
                shrieks, and violent actions.

            Combat: If caught in a battle, an ettercap first strikes with its claws, causing 1 - 3 points of damage with each set.The creature then tries to bite its opponent, inflicting 1 d8 points of damage with its teeth and powerful jaws.A successful bite attack by an et -
            tercap enables the monster to inject its victim with a powerful poison from the glands above the ettercap’ s fangs.

            The poison secreted by an ettercap is highly toxic and very sim -
            ilar to the poison of giant spiders.A creature injected with it must immediately roll a saving
            throw vs.poison, A failed roll means
            that the creature dies within 1 d4 turns when the toxigen paralyzes the victim 's heart.

            Many adventurers never get the chance to raise a sword against ettercaps because of the devious traps they use
            for protection.Et -
            tercaps prefer to ambush unwary travelers and lead them into traps rather than fight them face to face.

            Like spiders, ettercaps have silk glands located in their abdo -
            men.The thin, strong strands of silvery silk - like material these glands secrete are used by ettercaps to construct elaborate traps made up of nets, trip wires, garottes, and anything
            else the mon -
                sters can make out of the strands.The traps are designed so that
            they often immobilize the adventurer who stumbles into it.If this











            is the
            case, ettercaps never hesitate to attack that character first,
            trying to poison the victim before he escapes, Different ettercaps prefer different trap designs, so encounters with different etter -
            caps should expose the adventurer to new traps each time,

            Habitat / Society:
                Ettercaps prefer to dwell in the deepest part of a forest, near paths that are frequented by game or travelers.The creatures’ nests are made of a frame of strands filled with rotting leaves and moss.The lairs are often located on the ground, but can also be found up in large, sturdy trees.No treasure is to be found in ettercap lairs, but occasionally items dropped by adven -
                turers who have fallen into ettercap traps are found nearby.

                Though usually only one ettercap is encountered at any time,
                on rare occasions a pair of ettercaps can be found together.The pairs encountered are always mated couples, though the female and male appear to be identical.Ettercap young are abandoned as soon as they are born, so adults are never encountered with young.

                Ecology: An ettercap eats any meat, regardless of the type of creature from which it comes, Upon capturing a victim, the etter -
                cap poisons it so it cannot escape; once the creature is dead, the ettercap immediately devours as much of the corpse as possible.Typically, an ettercap can consume an entire deer or a large hu -
                manoid in a single sitting.Anything remaining after the ettercap has gorged itself is left
                for scavengers.

                Often(40 % ), 2 d4 spiders of some monstrous type are found cooperating with an ettercap.The ettercap uses any giant spider webs available when it designs its traps.Creatures killed by an et -
                tercap in the web of a giant spider are shared with the spider in -
                stead of being devoured entirely by the ettercap.

                Ettercap poison is highly valued, partly because of its extreme toxicity and partly because it is rather difficult to obtain, An et -
                tercap 's poison glands hold only one ounce of poison at any time,
                but this ounce is worth up to 1, 000 gp on the open market.

            XP VALUE: 3, 000

            Ettins, or two - headed giants, as they are often called, are vicious and unpredictable hunters that stalk by night and eat any meat they can
            catch.

            An ettin at first appears to be a stone or hill giant with two heads.On closer inspection, however, the creature 's vast differ-
            ences from the relatively civilized giant races become readily ap -
            parent.An ettin has pink to brownish skin, though it appears to be covered in a dark brown hide.This is because an ettin never bathes
            if it can help it, and is therefore usually encrusted with a thick layer of dirt and grime.Its skin is thick, giving the ettin its low Armor Class.An ettin’ s hair is long, stringy, and unkempt; its teeth are large, yellowing, and often rotten.The ettin’ s facial fea -
            tures strongly resemble those of an orc— large watery eyes,
            turned - up piggish snout, and large mouth.

            An ettin’ s right head is always the dominant one.Also, an et -
            tin 's right arm and leg will likely appear slightly more muscular
            and well - developed than the left.An ettin wears only rough, un -
            treated skins, which are also dirty and unwashed.Obviously, an ettin smells very bad, due to its complete lack of grooming habits— good or bad.

            Ettins do not have a true language of their own.Instead, they
            speak a mish - mash of orc, goblin, giant dialects, and the align -
            ment tongue of chaotic evil creatures.Any adventurer who speaks orcish can understand 50 % of what an ettin says.

            Combat: Having two heads is definitely an advantage
            for an et -
            tin, as one is always alert, watching
            for danger and potential food, This means that an ettin is surprised only on the roll of a 1 on 1 d10.An ettin also has infravision up to 90 feet, which enables it to hunt and fight effectively in the dark.

            Though ettins have a low intelligence, they are cunning fight -
            ers.They prefer to ambush their victims rather than charge into a straight fight, but once the battle has started, ettins usually fight furiously until all enemies are dead, or the battle turns against them.Ettins do not retreat easily, only doing so
            if victory is im -
            possible.

            In combat, an ettin has two attacks.Because each of its two heads controls an arm, an ettin does not suffer an attack roll pen -
            alty
            for attacking with both arms, An ettin always attacks with two large clubs, often covered with spikes.Using these weapons,











            e a) ys hs MAGN

            the ettin causes 2 d8 points of damage with its left arm,
        and 3 d6 points of damage with its right.If the ettin is disarmed or unable to use a weapon,
        it attacks empty - handed,
        inflicting 1 d10 points of damage with its left fist and 2 d6 points with its right.



        Habitat / Society: Ettins like to establish their lairs in remote,
        rocky areas.They dwell in dark,
        underground caves that stink of decaying food and offal.Ettins are generally solitary,
        and mated pairs only stay together
        for a few months after a young ettin is born to them.Young ettins mature very quickly,
        and within eight to ten months after they are born,
        they are self - sufficient enough to go off on their own.

        On rare occasions,
        however,
        a particularly strong ettin may gather a small group of 1 d4 ettins together.This small band of et -
        tins stays together only as long as the leader remains alive and un -
        defeated in battle.Any major defeat shatters the leader 's hold
        over the band,
        and they each go their separate ways.

        Ettins collect treasure only because it can buy them the services of goblins or orcs.These creatures sometimes serve ettins by building traps around their lairs,
        or helping to fight off a powerful opponent.Ettins have also been known to occasionally keep 1 - 2 cave bears in the area of their lairs.

        The sloppy caves of ettins are a haven
        for parasites and vermin,
        and it isn’ t unusual
        for the ettins themselves to be infected with various parasitic diseases.Adventurers rummaging through ettin lairs
        for valuables will find the task disgusting,
        if not dangerous.

        Ecology: Because ettin society is so primitive,
        they produce lit -
        tle of any value to civilized creatures.Ettins tolerate the presence of other creatures,
        like orcs,
        in the area of their lair
        if they can be useful in some way.Otherwise,
        ettins tend to be violently isola -
        tionist,
        crushing trespassers without question.

            and defense capabilities.While fish are all basically water -
            dwellers, some have the ability to survive out of water and breath atmospheric oxygen.

            Giant Catfish

            A naturally occurring mutation of the normal catfish, giant cat -
            fish look like their smaller relations, from their grayish - brown skin to the feelers at the corners of their mouths.

            When hunting, a giant catfish tries to bite its prey, causing 3 d4 points of damage or,
            if possible, swallow it whole.A 7 - Hit Die catfish can swallow an object up to 3 '/2 feet in length. For each
            additional Hit Die the catfish has, add one foot to the maximum length that can be swallowed.Any creature swallowed whole suf -
            fers normal bite damage plus,
            for each round the creature remains inside the catfish, it suffers 1 point of damage and has a 5 %
            chance of suffocating.If the victim has a sharp - edged weapon, it may cut itself out of the catfish by inflicting internal damage equal to at least half of the cattish’ s original total hit points.Any attack from the outside that pierces the catfish has a 20 % chance of damaging a swallowed creature as well.

            The catfish can also employ its feelers as weapons by whipping its head back and forth.These feelers secrete a minor toxin and cause 2 d4 points of poison damage
            if they strike a creature.A suc -
            cessful saving
            throw vs.poison limits this damage to 1 d4 points.
            Two additional opponents can be attacked
            if they are within the range of the feelers.

            Since they are primarily bottom - feeding scavengers, catfish re -
            quire a large area in order to find enough food to survive.Conse -
            quently, catfish live alone rather than in groups.

            A more aggressive version of the normal gar, the giant gar in -
            habits deep fresh water lakes and rivers.The gar 's long, stream-
            lined body is covered with hard, overlapping scales and its alligator - like mouth contains needle - sharp teeth.

            The gar attacks with its teeth, inflicting 5 d4 points of damage per bite.On a score of 20, the gar swallows its victim whole.On average, a giant gar can swallow an object up to five feet long.Any creature swallowed has a 5 % chance of suffocating each round it remains inside the gar.A swallowed creature may use a sharp - edged weapon to cut its way free of the gar.(The weapon must be in the victim 's hand when he is swallowed, however.) To
                escape, the victim must inflict internal damage totaling at least 25 % of the giant gar’ s original hit points.Anyone attacking and successfully piercing the gar from the outside has a 20 % chance of also damaging any victims inside the gar.

                Giant Pike

                An inhabitant of deep fresh - water lakes, the giant pike has a long,
                flexible body and greenish - yellow coloring.

                The giant pike uses both its speed and camouflage when hunt -
                ing.Though a pike will sometimes stalk its prey, its most common approach is to wait in the weeds
                for a likely target and then dart out to
                catch it, biting its prey
                for 4 d4 points of damage, Because of their speed and natural camouflage, pike have a good chance to surprise their intended victims(-2 penalty to opponent 's sur-
                    prise roll).

                    Giant frogs resemble their more common relatives in everything but size, Their larger size means that they will consider larger creatures as a source of food, making small creatures and even de -
                    mihumans possible prey.

                    A giant frog can range anywhere from two to six feet in length,
                    and weigh between 50 and 250 pounds.(Figure that a two - foot frog weighs 50 pounds, and add 50 pounds
                        for each additional foot of length.) Frogs with 1 Hit Die are two feet long.Frogs from two to four feet long have 2 Hit Dice.Those over four feet long have 3 Hit Dice.

                    The distance that a giant frog can jump is based on its weight,
                    with the maximum jumping distance
                    for a 50 - pound frog being an incredible 180 feet.Heavier frogs cannot jump as far.(Subtract 20 feet per 50 pounds the frogs weighs over 50.) A giant frog cannot jump backward or directly to either side.All giant frogs can leap 30 feet straight up.

                    Combat: Because of its camouflaging color, a giant frog sur -
                    prises opponents easily(-3 penalty to opponents’ surprise rolls) when in its natural habitat.Whether it gains surprise or not, a gi -
                    ant frog will use its remarkably long and sticky tongue in combat to entrap its victim.The tongue is equal in length to three times the frog 's length and strikes with a +4 bonus to the attack roll.
                    The tongue inflicts no damage when it hits.

                    Once a victim is caught by the frog 's tongue, it has one chance
                    to hit the tongue before the frog attempts to reel it in .If the tongue is hit, the frog releases the victim and does not attack that crea -
                    ture again.If the victim misses the tongue, its fate largely depends upon its weight.

                    If the victim weighs less than the frog, it is dragged into the frog 's mouth in the same round it attacked and missed the tongue.
                    If the creature weighs more than the frog, an extra round is re -
                    quired
                    for the frog to draw the creature in .This grants the victim another opportunity to hit the tongue.Any creature weighing more than twice the frog 's weight cannot be pulled by the frog and
                    is released on the third round after it was caught, even
                    if the tongue is never struck.

                    35

                    Unsteady(6) 65

                    Once the victim has been drawn to the frog 's mouth, the frog
                    attempts to eat it.If the giant frog successfully bites its victim in
                    the first round the creature is in range, it automatically scores maximum damage.Frogs with 1 Hit Die bite
                    for 1 - 3 points of damage.Frogs with 2 Hit Dice inflict 1 d6é points of damage.Those with 3 Hit Dice bite
                    for 2 d4 points of damage.

                    On an attack roll result of 20, the frog can swallow whole any creature up to three feet long.Any creature swallowed whole has the chance to cut its way out of the frog with a sharp - edged weapon, but must roll an attack roll result of 18 or better.A vic -
                    tim has only three rounds to escape before asphyxiating.A suc -
                    cessful escape kills the frog.Any damage inflicted upon a frog that has swallowed a creature whole has a 33 % chance of being inflicted on the swallowed victim as well.

                    Giant frogs fear fire and will always retreat from it.

                    Habitat / Society: Giant frogs tend to live in groups, but don 't
                    have any real social structure.They are aggressive hunters and eat, among other things, insects, fish, and small mammals.Large aquatic predators such as giant fish and giant turtles often prey upon them,

                    Killer Frogs

                    This smaller version of the giant frog attacks using its sharp teeth and front talons.While it does not swallow victims whole, the killer frog is a vicious hunter and is especially fond of the taste of human flesh.The killer frog 's cannibalistic habits keep their num-
                    bers down.

                    Poisonous Frogs

                    A rare type of normal frog, this breed secretes a contact poison from its skin, as well as with its bite.The weakness of the poison gives all victims a + 4 bonus to their saving throws, Due to its weakness and the difficulty of collecting it, there is no market
                    for this poison.

                Fungi are simple plants that lack chlorophyll, true stems, roots,
                and leaves.Fungi are incapable of photosynthesis and live as par -
                asites or saprophytes.

                Ordinary Fungi

                Ordinary fungi are well known to man: molds, yeast, mildew,
                mushrooms, and puffballs.These plants include both useful and harmful varieties.

                Combat: Ordinary tungi do not attack or defend themselves,
                    but they are prolific and can spread where unwanted.

                Adventurers who have lost rations to mold or clothing to mil -
                dew have had unpleasant encounters with fungi.



                Habitat / Society: The bodies of most true fungi consist of slen -
                der cottony filaments.Anyone who wishes to see this
                for himself need only leave a damp piece of bread in a cupboard
                for a day or two.Examining the black mold on the bread with a magnifying glass will show off not only the filaments, but also the spore bodies at the top of these.The spores are what gives mold its color.

                Most fungi reproduce asexually by cell division, budding,
                fragmentation, or spores.Those that reproduce sexually alter -
                nate a sexual generation(gametophyte) with a spore - producing {
                    sporophyte) one.

                Fungi grow best in dark, damp environments, which they can find all too easily in a kitchen cupboard, backpack, or boot, A warm environment is preferred by some, such as yeasts and cer -
                tain molds, but excessive heat kills fungi.

                Proper storage and cleanliness can be used to avoid most ordi -
                nary fungi.

                Ecology: Fungi
                break down organic matter, thus playing an im -
                portant part in the nitrogen cycle by decomposing dead organ -
                isms into ammonia.Without the action of mushrooms and bracket fungi, soil renewal could not take place as readily as it does.

                Fungi are also useful to man
                for many purposes.Yeasts are valuable as fermenting agents, raising bread and brewing wines,
                beers, and ales.Certain molds are important
                for cheese produc -
                tion, The color in blue cheese is a mold that has been encouraged to grow in this semisoft cheese.

                Many fungi are edible, and connoisseurs consider some to be delicious.Pigs are used to hunt
                for truffles, an underground fun -
                gus that grows near tree roots and gives food a piquant flavor, No one has as yet managed to cultivate truffles— an enterprising bot -
                anist could make a mint by learning to grow these.

                Mushrooms, the fruiting body of another underground fungus,
                can sometimes be eaten, but can be so poisonous that the novice mushroom hunter is allowed but one mistake in picking.The my -
                celium producing a single mushroom might extend beneath the ground
                for several feet in any direction,

                Medicinally, green molds(such as penicillium) can be used as folk remedies
                for various bacterial infections.Fungus

                An alchemist expert in the ways of fungi can produce a variety of useful substances from their action on various materials.

                Violet Fungus

                Violet fungus growths resemble shriekers, and are usually(75 % ) encountered with them, The latter are immune to the touch of vi -
                olet fungi, and the two types of creatures complement each oth -
                er 's existence.

                Combat: Violet fungi favor rotted animal matter to grow upon.Each fungus has one to four branches with which it flails out
                if any animal comes within range(see following).The excretion from these branches rots flesh in one round unless a successful saving
                throw vs.poison is rolled or a cure disease spell is used.
                The branch length of this fungi depends upon the fungi 's size, Vio-
                let fungi range from four to seven feet tall, the smallest having
                one - foot - long branches, the five - foot - tall fungi having two - foot -
                long branches, and so on.Any sized growth can have up to four branches.

                Shrieker

                Shriekers are normally quiet, mindless fungi that are ambulatory.They are dangerous to dungeon explorers because of the hellish racket they make.

                Combat: Light within 30 feet or movement within 10 feet causes a shrieker to emit a piercing shriek that lasts
                for 1 - 3 rounds.This noise has a 50 % chance of attracting wandering monsters each round thereafter.

                Habitat / Society: They live in dark places beneath the ground,
                often in the company of violet fungi.When the shriekers attract curious dungeon dwellers by their shrieking, the violet fungi are able to kill them with their branches, leaving plenty of organic matter
                for these saprophytic life forms to feed on.

                Ecology: Purple worms and shambling mounds greatly prize shriekers as food, and don 't seem to mind the noise while eating.

                Shrieker spores are an important ingredient in potions of plant control,

                Phycomid

                The algae - like phycomids resemble fibrous blobs of decompos -
                ing, milk - colored matter with capped fungi growing out of them.They exude a highly alkaline substance(like lye) when attacking.

                Combat: These fungoid monsters have sensory organs
                for heat,
                sound, and vibrations located in several clusters.When phy -
                comids attack, they extrude a tube and discharge the alkaline fluid in small globules that have a range of 1 d6 + 6 feet.

                In addition to alkaline damage, the globs that these creatures discharge might also cause victims to serve as hosts
                for new phy -
                comid growth.If a victim fails a saving
                throw vs.poison, the in -
                    dividual begins to sprout mushroom - like growths in the infected
                area.This occurs in 1 d4 + 4 rounds and inflicts 1 d4 + 4 points of

                damage.The growths then spread throughout the host body, kill -
                ing it in 1 d4 + 4 turns, and turning it into anew phycomid.A cure disease spell will stop the spread through the host.

                Ascomoid

                Ascomoids are huge, puffball - like fungi with very thick, leathery skin.They move by rolling.

                Combat: At first, an ascomoid’ s movement is slow— 3
                for the first round, 6 the next, then 9, then
                finally 12— but they can keep it up
                for hours without tiring.

                Ascomoids attack by rolling into or over opponents.Small -
                and medium - sized opponents are knocked down and must rise during the next round or remain prone,

                The creature 's surface is covered with numerous pocks which
                serve as sensory organs, Each pock can also emit a jet of spores to attack dangerous enemies.Large opponents or those who have inflicted damage upon the ascomoids are always attacked by spore jets.The stream of spores is about one foot in diameter and 30 feet long.Upon striking, the stream puffs into a cloud of varia -
                ble diameter(five to 20 feet).The creatures under attack must roll a successful saving
                throw vs.poison or die from infection in their
                internal systems in 1 d4 rounds.Even those who save are blinded and choked to such an extent that they require 1 d4 rounds to re -
                cover and rejoin melee.Meanwhile, they are nearly helpless, and all attacks upon them gain a + 4 bonus to attack rolls with no shield or Dexterity bonuses allowed.

                Different types of weapons affect the ascomoid differently.Piercing weapons, such as spears, score double damage.Shorter stabbing weapons do damage as
                if against a small - sized oppo -
                nent, Blunt weapons do not harm ascomoids;
                slashes and cuts from edged weapons cause only 1 point of damage.An ascomoid saves against magical attacks, such as magic missiles, fireballs,
                and lightning, with a + 4 bonus to the saving
                throw; damage is only 50 % of normal.(Cold - based attacks are at normal probabil -
                    ities and damage.) As these fungi have no minds by ordinary standards, all spells affecting the brain(charm, ESP, etc.), unless specific to plants, are useless.

                Gas Spore

                At any distance greater than 10 feet, a gas spore is 90 % likely to be mistaken
                for a beholder.Even at close ranges there is a 25 %
                possibility that the creature is seen as a beholder,
                for a gas spore has a false central eye and rhizome growths atop it that strongly resemble the eye stalks of a beholder.

                Combat: If the spore is struck
                for even 1 point of damage it ex -
                plodes.Every creature within a 20 - foot radius suffers 6 d6 points of damage(3 d6
                    if a saving
                    throw vs.wands is successful).

                If a gas spore makes contact with exposed flesh, the spore shoots tiny rhizomes into the living matter and grows through the victim 's system within one round. The gas spore dies immedi-
                ately.The victim must have a cure disease spell cast on him within 24 hours or die, sprouting 2 d4 gas spores.

            The galeb duhr is a curious boulder - like creature with appendages that act as hands and feet.These intelligent beings are very large and slow - moving.They live in rocky or mountainous areas where they can feel the earth power and control the rocks around them.

            A typical galeb duhr is from eight to 12 feet tall.When not moving it looks like part of the terrain it lives in .

            Combat: Galeb duhr are fairly solitary creatures, preferring to live with a few of their own kind, and none of any other kind, in -
            cluding earth elementals.When approached, a galeb duhr is liable to avoid the encounter by disappearing into the ground, If chased or otherwise irritated, however, a galeb duhr does not hesitate to fight the intruder.

            Galeb duhr can cast the following spells as 20 th - level mages,
            once per day: move earth, stone shape, passwall, transmute rock to mud, and wall of stone.They can cast stone shape at will.

            They can animate 1 - 2 boulders within 60 yards of them(AC 0; MV 3; HD 9; Dam 4 d6) as a treant controls trees.Galeb duhr suf -
            fer double damage from cold - based attacks and save with a - 4 penalty against these attacks.They are not harmed by lightning or normal fire, but suffer full damage from magical fire(though they save with a + 4 bonus against fire attacks).

            Habitat / Society: Galeb duhr, thought to be native to the ele -
            mental plane of Earth, are sometimes encountered in small family groups in mountainous regions of the Prime Material plane.

            It is not known how(or whether) galeb duhr reproduce, but“ young” galeb duhr have occasionally been reported— those spec -
            imens encountered being a smaller size than normal.

            While galeb duhr seem to have no visible culture above ground, they are known to collect gems, which they find through their passwall ability.They sometimes have small magical items in their possession, evidently taken from those who attacked them to take their gems.

            The“ music” of the galeb duhr often provides the first evidence that these creatures are near— and usually the only evidence, as the unsociable galeb duhr are quick to pass into the ground when they feel the vibrations of approaching visitors.











            Sitting together in groups, the galeb duhr harmonize their grav -
            elly voices into eldritch tunes; some sages speculate that these melodies can cause or prevent earthquakes.Others argue that the low rumbling produced by these creatures is a form of warning to others in the group, but there is no conclusive evidence either way.

            Ecology: Galeb duhr have no natural enemies, other than those who crave the gems they collect.Galeb duhr eat rock, preferring granite to other types, and disdaining any sedimentary type.The rocks they eat become part of the huge creatures; such a meal need take place only once every two or three months.

            Besides the gems that they carry with them, galeb duhr are likely to know where many other gems are, as well as veins of precious metals, such as gold, silver, and platinum, though galeb duhr seem to have no interest in these minerals
            for themselves.A few powerful mages have been able to bargain with the galeb duhr
            for this information.This is a difficult agreement to con -
            summate,
            for the galeb duhr are valiant fighters, and usually have no difficulty in escaping from any harm
            if they are inclined to do so.Further, the galeb duhr are territorial, and would be irri -
                tated at any attempt to make use of this knowledge in their vicin -
                ity.

            In some strange way, galeb duhr feel responsible
            for the smaller rocks and boulders around them, in much the same way that a treant feels responsible
            for trees in its neighborhood.A traveler who disturbs the area near a galeb duhr does so at his own peril.Gargoyle

                These monsters are ferocious predators of a magical nature, typi -
                cally found amid ruins or dwelling in underground caverns.They have their own guttural language.

                Combat: Gargoyles attack anything they detect, regardless of whether it is good or evil, 90 % of the time.They love best to tor -
                ture prey to death when it is helpless.

                These winged creatures are excellent fighters with four attacks per round.Their claw / claw / bite / horn combination can inflict up to 16 points of damage,
                while their naturally tough hide pro -
                tects them from victim 's attacks.

                Gargoyles favor two types of attack: surprise and swooping.Counting on their appearance as sculptures of some sort, gar -
                goyles sit motionless around the rooftop of a building, waiting
                for prey to approach.Alternatively, a gargoyle may pose in a fountain, or a pair of the horrid beasts sit on either side of a door -
                way.When the victim is close enough, the gargoyles suddenly strike out, attempting only to injure the victim rather than to kill it all at once.(To a gargoyle, inflicting a slow, painful death is best.)

                When on the move, gargoyles sometimes use a“ swoop” attack,
                dropping down suddenly from the sky to make their attacks in an aerial ambush.In this
                case, they can make either two claw attacks or one horn attack.To make all four of their attacks, they must

                land.

                Habitat / Society:
                    Gargoyles live in small groups with others of their kind, interested in little more than finding other creatures to hurt.Smaller animals are scarcely worth the trouble to these hid -
                    eous monsters, who prefer to attack humans or other intelligent creatures,

                    Gargoyles often collect treasure from human victims.Individ -
                    uals usually have a handful of gold pieces among them, with the bulk of their treasure hidden carefully at their lair, usually buried or under a large stone.

                    Ecology: Originally, gargoyles were carved roof spouts, repre -
                    senting grotesque human and animal figures.They were designed in such a way that water flowing down gutters would be thrown away from the wall, so as to prevent stains and erosion.Later,







                    some unknown mage used a powerful enchantment to bring these horrid sculptures to life.The race of gargoyles has flourished,
                    spreading throughout the world.

                    Gargoyles do not need to eat or drink, so they can stand mo -
                        tionless
                    for as long as they wish almost anywhere, The damage they do to other creatures is not
                    for sustenance, but only
                    for their distorted sense of pleasure.

                    Because they are fairly intelligent and evil, they will sometimes serve an evil master of some sort.In this
                case, the gargoyles usu -
                ally act as guards or messengers; besides some gold or a few gems,
                their unsavory payment is the enjoyment they get from attacking unwanted visitors.

                The horn of the gargoyle is the more common active ingredient
                for a potion of invulnerability and can also be used in a potion of flying.

                Kapoacinth

                This creature is a marine variety of gargoyle that uses its wings to swim as fast as the land - dwelling gargoyle flies.Kapoacinth con -
                form in all respects to a normal gargoyle.They dwell in relatively shallow waters, lairing in undersea caves,

                Like gargoyles, kapoacinth are eager to cause pain to others,
                and mermen, sea elves, and human visitors are all equally quali -
                fied candidates
                for this.

                Margoyle

                Margoyles are a more horrid form of gargoyle.They are found mainly in caves and caverns.Their skin is so like stone that they are only 20 % likely to be seen when against it.They attack with two claws, a pair of horns, and a bite.They speak their own lan -
                guage and that of gargoyles, They are 20 % likely to be found with the latter, either as leaders or masters.Genie

                    The two varieties of genie described here come from the Prime Material plane and the elemental plane of Water.Living among their own kind, organized into their own societies, these beings are sometimes encountered on the Prime Material plane, often summoned specifically to perform some service.

                    All genies can travel to any elemental plane, as well as the Prime Material and Astral planes.

                    Jann

                    The race of the jann is the weakest of the elemental humanoids(dao, djinni, efreeti, marid) collectively known as genies, because a jann is formed out of all four elements and must therefore spend most of his time on the Prime Material plane.In addition to speaking the common tongue and the various languages of ge -
                    niekind, jann are able to speak with animals.

                    Combat: Jann often(60 % ) wear chain mail armor, which gives an effective AC of 2. They typically use large scimitars(inflicting 2 d4 points of damage against small and medium opponents, or 2 d8 points against large opponents) and composite long bows.Male jann have Strengths ranging from 18 / 01 to 18 / 00, and te -
                    males have Strengths from 17(roll of 01 - 50) to 18 / 50(roll of 51 -
                        00).

                    In addition to the ability to fly, jann have the following spell -
                    like powers they can employ at will, one at a time, one per round:
                    growth / reduction twice each per day, invisibility three times per day, create food and water once per day as a 7 th - level priest, and etherealness once per day
                    for a maximum of one hour.Jann per -
                    form at 12 th - level ability, except as noted.

                    Habitat / Society: Jann favor dwelling in forlorn desert areas at hidden oases, where they have both privacy and safety.The soci -
                    ety of jann is very open, and males and females are regarded as equals.A group of 1 d20 + 10 individuals typically makes up a tribe ruled by a sheik and one or two viziers.Exceptionally pow -
                    erful sheiks are given the title of amir, and in time of need they gather and command large forces of jann(and sometimes allied humans).

                    Many jann tribes are nomadic, traveling with flocks of camels,
                    goats, or sheep from oasis to oasis.These bedouin jann appear







                    human in every respect, and are often confused with them— unless they are attacked.The jann are strong and brave, and do
                        not take kindly to insult or injury.The area covered by a jann
                    tribe can extend hundreds of miles in any direction.

                    While traveling, the jann live in large, colorful tents with their wives and married male children.Married daughters move away to live with their new husbands.When a family eventually grows to a size that can no longer reside comfortably in the tent, a new tent is built, and a son takes his wife and family with him to this new dwelling.At permanent oases, the jann not only live in tents,
                    but also in elegantly styled structures built from materials brought from any of the elemental planes.

                    Jann are able to dwell in air, earth, fire, or water environments
                    for up to 48 hours.This includes the elemental planes, to which any jann can travel, even taking up to six individuals along
                    if those persons hold hands in a circle with the jann.Failure to re -
                    turn to the Prime Material plane within 48 hours inflicts 1 point of damage per additional hour on the jann, until a
                    return to that
                    plane occurs or the jann dies.Travel to another elemental plane is possible, without damage, providing at least two days were spent on the Prime Material plane immediately prior to the travel.

                    Ecology: Jann tend to be suspicious of humans.They do not like
                    demihumans, and detest humanoids.Jann accept djinn, but shun dao, efreet, and marids.They sometimes befriend humans or work with them
                    for some desired reward, such as potent magical items.

                    One ethic that the jann share with other bedouins is the cultural demand
                    for treating guests with honor and respect.Innocent visi -
                    tors(including humans) to the jann are treated hospitably during their stay, but some day might be expected to
                    return the favor.

                    Jannee Leaders: Jannee leaders have genius(17 - 18) Intelligence,
                    higher Hit Dice(up to 8
                        for sheiks, 9
                        for amirs) and greater Strength(19 possible 10 % of the time).Viziers have Intelligence of genius to supra - genius(19 - 20) and the following spell - like powers: augury, detect magic, and divination, three times per day each at 12 th - level ability.

                    Genie

                    Marid

                    The marid are said to be born of the ocean, with currents as their muscles and pearls as their teeth.These genies from the elemental plane of Water, are the most powerful of all geniekind.They are also the most individual and chaotic of the elemental races, and only rarely deign to serve others.

                    On their own plane they are rare; marids travel so seldom to the Prime Material plane that many Prime Material regions con -
                    sider marids to be creatures of legend only.Like other true genies,
                    marids can speak their own tongue and that of any person or beast with intelligence they meet, through a limited form of telep -
                    athy that enables them to speak appropriately.

                    Combat: Marids perform as 26 th - level spellcasters.Their magi -
                    cal properties enable them any of the following spell - like powers,
                    one at a time, twice each per day: detect evil / good, detect invisi -
                    ble, detect magic, invisibility, assume liquid form(similar to as -
                        sume gaseous form), polymorph self, and purify water.Marids can perform any of the following up to seven times per day: as -
                    sume gaseous form, lower water, part water, wall of fog, or be -
                    stow water breathing upon others
                    for up to one full day.Once per year a marid can use alter reality.

                    Marids can always create water, which they can direct in a powerful jet up to 60 yards long, causing both blinding effect on the individual struck(saving
                        throw applies) and 1 d6 points dam -
                    age.Marids also have the innate ability to water walk(as the ring).

                    It is possible
                    for a marid to freely carry 1, 000 pounds in weight.Double this weight causes tiring in three turns.For every 200 pounds under 2, 000, add one turn to the marid 's carrying, ability
                    (e.g., 1, 200 pounds can be carried
                        for seven turns before tiring oc -
                        curs).A Hired marid must rest
                    for six turns.

                    Marids swim very fast.Of course they can breathe water and are at home at any depth.They have infravision.

                    Marids are not harmed by water - based spells.Cold - based spells grant them a + 2 bonus to saving throws and - 2 to each die of damage.Fire inflicts + 1 per die of damage, with saving throws at a - 1 penalty.Note that steam does not harm them.

                    Habitat / Society: Marids live in a loose empire ruled by a pa -
                    disha,
                    for each marid lays some claim to royalty— they are all shahs, atabegs, beglerbegs, or mufti at the very least.There have often been several "true heirs” to the padisha’s throne simultane-
                    ously through the eons.

                    A marid household numbers 2 d10 and is located around loosely grouped elemental pockets containing the basic necessi -
                    ties
                    for marid life.Larger groups of marids gather
                    for hunts and jousts, during which individual effort is heavily emphasized.

                    The race of marids is very independent and egoistic.Forcing a marid to serve is a most difficult task.Bribery and flattery may be slightly more successful, but marids can never be relied upon.

                    Marids are champion tale - tellers, though most of their tales emphasize their own prowess and belittle others.When commu -
                    nicating with a marid, one must attempt to keep the conversation going without continual digression
                    for one tale of might or an -
                    other,
                    while not offending the marid.(Marids consider it a capital offense
                        for a lesser being to offend a marid.)

                    Marids are not easily forced to perform actions; even
                    if con -
                    vinced(usually through flattery and bribery) to obey, they often stray off their intended courses to seek some other adventure that promises greater glory, or to instruct lesser creatures on the glor -
                    ies of maridkind.Most mages skilled in summoning and conjura -
                    tion consider marids to be more trouble than they are worth,
                    which accounts
                    for the great lack of marid - controlling items(as opposed to those affecting efreet and djinn),

                    Besides the Astral, elemental, and Prime Material planes, the planes that all genies can travel to, the Ethereal plane is also open to marids.

                    Ecology: Marids tolerate their geniekind relatives, putting up

                    with the jannee and djinn like poor cousins,
                    while evincing much dislike of the efreet and dao.Their attitude toward the rest of the world is somewhat similar: most creatures from other planes are lesser beings, not to be bothered with unless one lands in the feast -

                        A diminutive relation to true giants, cyclopskin are single - eyed giants that live alone or in small bands.

                        The typical cyclopskin weighs around 350 pounds, and stands 7 "/2 feet tall. A single large, red eye dominates the center of its
                        forehead.Shaggy black or dull, deep blue hair lies in a tangled mess on its head and shoulders.Its skin is a ruddy brown to muddy yellow.Cyclopskin commonly dress in a ragged, patch -
                        work quilt of animal hides.Crude sandals are formed from sev -
                        eral layers of hide.They usually smell of field, equal parts of dirt and dung.Their voices are rough and sharp, like a wagon wheel broken on a boulder.

                        Combat: A cyclopskin is armed with either a club(treated as a morning star) or a bardiche(axe head on a five - foot - long pole).Each also carries a heavy hurling spear(1 d6 damage, +4 Strength bonus) and a sling of great size(ld6 damage).Cyclopskin are treated as having a Strength of at least 18. An exceptional speci -
                        men may have a Strength of 19. They never wear armor or use shields, as their tough hide gives them reasonable protection from harm.

                        Cyclopskin do not bother with great strategy in combat.If
                        their opponents are out of reach, they use slings or hurl heavy spears.They can not
                        throw boulders like true giants.Since the
                        single eye of the cyclopskin gives it poor depth perception, all missile attacks suffer a - 2 penalty to attack rolls, but not to dam -
                        age.If the opponents are close, the cyclopskin rush in to fight with their clubs or bardiches.

                        Habitat / Society: These single - eyed humanoids shy away from any organized settlement.If left alone, they tend to leave armed groups alone.However, they are not above attacking a much weaker force
                        if stumbled upon.Cyclopskin have no regard
                        for any form of life other than others of their kind.Captives are ei -

                        Being poor hunters, most cyclopskin clans keep small herds of

                        By i



                        creatures, such as goats or sheep.Some clans are nomadic, others stay put in their caves.Once a year, in the spring, area clans meet to exchange goods and slaves and to select mates.On rare occa -

                        ers.This leads to many brawls and fist fights.There are no rules in such a fight, and it can lead to death or permanent injury
                        for the loser.

                        A cyclopskin cave is sealed with boulders to allow only one en -
                        trance.Inside,
                        if size permits, there is a wooden pen to house both animals and slaves.These always have roofs, either of wooden bars or of the cave ceiling.At night, a large boulder or stout wooden gate is placed at the entrance to protect the cyclopskin from predators.There is no interior fire pit, as cyclopskin use fire infrequently, and always outside on those rare occasions.(Cy -
                            clopskin tend to distrust fire.) Any treasure, always ill - gotten, is kept in a sack in the cave.

                        Ecology: A cyclopskin can survive on almost any animal or plant diet.They enjoy meat of all sorts and prize it above vegeta -
                        ble foods, While they live off the land, they do not live with it.
                        They have absolutely no sanitary practices, and rarely even cook their meals.They take no care to preserve their environment

                        The life of a cyclopskin is hazardous, and hence they have a short life expectancy.Besides human adventurers, there are many predators, such as tigers, true giants and other giant kin,
                        wyverns, and trolls, that are not above attacking a small group of these giant kin.However, mountain dwarves actually go out of their way to hunt cyclopskin, receiving the dwarven bonus against giantkind

                            Of all the giant - kin, the firbolg is the most powerful, due to natu -
                            ral intelligence and considerable magical power.

                            Firbolgs appear to be normal humans, except that they are over LO feet tall and weigh over 800 pounds.They wear their hair long and keep great, thick beards.Their skin is a normal fleshy pink,
                            with any shade of hair color, although blonde and red are most common, The flesh and skin of firbolgs are unusually dense and tough.Their voices are a smooth, deep bass, thick with rolling consonanis.

                            Combat: Firbolgs can use any large size weapons; they disdain the use of armor or shields, Of manmade weapons, they preter two - handed swords and halberds, both of which they may use in
                            one hand without penalty.Weapons of their own make are dou -
                            ble size equivalents of human weapons,
                            for which they get a Strength bonus(19 Strength, +7 damage).However, when used with both hands, these huge weapons inflict double their normal damage, plus the Strength bonus

                            If a firbolg has one hand free, it can bat away up to two missiles per round, Large missiles, such as boulders, or those with long shafts, such as javelins and spears, can be caught
                            if desired.A
                            catch or bat is successful 75 % of the time(6 or better on 1 d20).A caught weapon may be thrown at any opponent on the next round with a - 2 penalty to the attack roll,
                            for using its off hand,

                            All firbolgs have the following magical powers, usable once per day, on any round they are not engaged in melee combat: detect magic, diminution(as double the potion), fools gold, forget, and alter self, There isa 5 % cumulative chance per member of a group that one of the firbolgs is a shaman of Ist through 7 th level.

                            Firbolgs are cautious and crafty, They have learned to distrust and fear humans and demihumans.If possible they avoid an encounter, either by hiding or with deception.If forced to fight,
                            they do so with great strategy, utilizing the terrain and situation
                            to best effect.They operate as a group, not a collection of individ -
                            uals.Ten percent of all encounters is a large group of 4 d4 mem -
                            bers en route to an enclave of some sort.

                            Habitat / Society: Firbolgs live in remote forests and hills.These giant - kin distrust most other civilized races, and stay well away trom them.They keep on even terms with druids and the faerie







                            creatures, including elves, neither asking nor giving much, but avoiding insult or injury.Strangers are met with caution, fre -

                                    larly those that relieve strangers of treasure.

                                Firbolg society is close - knit and centered around the family or
                            clan.Each clan has 4 d4 members and frequently a shaman.The level of the shaman is determined by rolling 2 d4 - 1
                            if the DM doesn 't wish to choose it himself. The clans live apart trom each
                            other, existing as gatherers and sometimes nomads.Their homes are huge, single - storey, wooden houses with stout walls and a central fireplace opening in several directions in the common room.When great decisions are needed, the clans involved meet in an enclave.This happens at least once a year at the fall solstice,
                            just to celebrate
                            if nothing
                            else .The shamans preside over these
                            events, and settle any disputes between clans.

                            Ecology: Firbolgs live off the land and with it.Their homes are built from trees cleared from around the house.The clan does keep a field
                            for harvest, but only enough to supplement their diet.They trade tasks involving great strength
                            for food, usually with other peaceful folk in the forests or hills.The rest of their food is obtained by gathering and hunting an area up to 20 miles from their homestead, Meat is used in small quantities
                            for most meals,
                            although major celebrations always include a large roast of some sort.

                            Although many creatures are capable of killing a firbolg, none hunt them explicitly.They are stronger than most forest beasts,
                            and intelligent creatures know better than to mess with them.They avoid true giants, except storm giants, and aggressively re -

                                Fomorians are the most hideous, deformed, and wicked of all giant - kin.

                                The fomorian giants are all grossly deformed behemoths.Each has a different set of deformities, which must be determined by the DM.A partial list of deformations includes misplaced limb,
                                misshapen limb, misplaced facial feature, hunchbacked, bulging body part, drooping flesh, body part too big or too small, flap -
                                ping ears, huge snout, large feet on short legs.Their thick, hairy hides, combined with the pelts and odd metal bits they wear
                                for protection, give an effective AC of 3. They have scattered patches of hair as tough as wire on their pale white skin.Large warts and other growths are scattered across their bodies.There is no single odor associated with fomorians; some smell strongly due to over -
                                active sweat glands, others have no smell.Their voices are also each different due to their unique deformities.

                                Combat: Fomorians use all manner of clubs and other blunt in -
                                struments.Regardless of the weapon, it inflicts double damage plus 8 points
                                for Strength,
                                while their fists alone inflict 2 d4 + 8 points of damage.Their deformities prevent them from hurling boulders as true giants.They work any bits of metal they can find and scavenge into their clothing, to aid their Armor Class.The typical fomorian is AC 3,
                                while a particularly well - armored one,
                                or one with a shield, might get an AC as good as 1, but no better.

                                Typical fomorian strategy is too sneak up on an opponent and hit him as hard as it can.It works well
                                for them since their oppo -
                                nents suffer a - 2 penalty to their surprise rolls, because the fomor -
                                ians move slowly and carefully.These giant - kin are only surprised on a 1 on the 1 d10 surprise roll, because they tend to have eyes and ears in odd places on their heads.If the fomorian bothers to keep an opponent alive, he is crudely tortured until dead, and then eaten.

                                Habitat / Society: Fomorians live in mountain caves, abandoned mines, or other subterranean realms.They rarely modify their homes, but adapt to what is already there.These deformed giants wander throughout the underground complex,
                                for almost any distance, stopped only by hazards they do not want to challenge.
                                A fomorian clan picks a small(to them) defensible alcove in
                                which to lair, Their territories are sometimes marked by the







                                bodies of their enemies.Their treasure consists only of stolen items from enemies.Pieces of armor are added to their own patchwork protection.Since they do not care
                                for it, this armor quickly deteriorates and becomes worthless.

                                Their society is ruled by depravity and wickedness.The strong -
                                est and cruelest giant rules over all the others within reach, which is usually a smal] number.The women and children are treated as slaves.Acts of violence are common among fomorians, some -
                            times resulting in permanent injury or death.

                            Fomorian giants have been known to work with other crea -
                            tures
                            for evil causes.Usually the other creatures must completely dominate the fomorians, or be capable of it, to form the alliance.Such an agreement lasts only as long as the fomorians fear their cohorts.Once their interests no longer coincide or the fomorians no longer feel threatened, they double - cross their partners, as gruesomely as possible.

                            Ecology: These twisted giants can live
                            for weeks on little or no food.This is good, because their underground dwellings do not

                            Known as“ human behemoths, ”these human giants inhabit areas infested with hill giants and ogres.

                            Verbeeg vary in height from 8 '/2 to 10 feet tall, and weigh be-
                            tween 300 and 400 pounds.They are unusually thin
                            for their height, although this does not inhibit their fighting ability.Some have minor deformities, such as club foot, uneven eyes, hair lips,
                            etc.In all other respects they appear human, including skin, hair,
                            and eye color.They wear as much protective clothing and armor as they can obtain, which isn’ t much.Usually they wear furs and hides with pieces of metal armor stitched into strategic places.They almost always carry shields and have the best weapons they can steal.Typically this means clubs and spears.

                            Combat: Verbeeg are smart enough to
                            let others soften up the
                            enemy first.This does not mean that they are cowards, only self -
                            ish and practical.Since they are commonly found with hill giants and ogres, in the first few rounds of combat verbeeg drive their less intelligent companions before them into battle.This is ac -
                            companied by many curses, oaths, and highly descriptive ac -
                            counts of the giants’ and ogres’ parentage.

                            Once the battle has begun, the verbeeg take on the stragglers and use their missile weapons, usually spears.The Strength of the giant determines how much further than normal the weapons can be hurled.Whatever their weaponry, the verbeeg get a Strength bonus
                            for damage.Each giant must have his Strength determined individually(or once
                                for the whole group, at the DM 's option) by
                                rolling 1 d10 and consulting the following table.Armor is always at least the equivalent of AC 4, and sometimes better, although never better than AC 1.

                                Habitat / Society: Verbeeg are found in the same climates as ogres and hill giants.These human behemoths are never found wandering alone.Thirty percent of wandering verbeeg encoun -

                                    case).

                                A verbeeg lair is usually an underground place, such as a cave or inside old ruins.There 5 d6é of them can be found, an equal number of females(equal to males in combat), and 2 d6 young.Halt the young fight as bugbears, the other half tight as goblins.A lair usually includes 2 d4 wolves(75 % chance) or 1 d4 worgs(25 %
                                    chance).In arctic climes substitute 1 - 2 polar bears
                                for wolves,
                                and 1 - 3 winter wolves
                                for wargs.

                                There is a 2 % cumulative chance per giant of a shaman with the tribe, The verbeeg are jointly ruled by the shaman(
                                    if there is one) and a warrior chieftain.The shaman can be up to 7 th level, The warrior chieftain always has 18 / 00 Strength and no fewer than 40 hit points.The chieftain is responsible
                                for all activities involving hunting, war and negotiations with strangers.The shaman is re -

                                Ecology: Verbeeg eat almost anything, but they love flesh of all sorts.They maintain a mutually beneficial relationship with the giants and ogres that share their lair.The verbeeg provide the in -
                                telligence and direction that these giant types lack, and the giants provide protection by their greater fighting prowess.To watch a group in action can be hilarious, so long as you are not their in -

                                    for they simply trample bushes and splinter smaller trees.Gorgons speak no languages but
                                    let out a roar of anger whenever they encounter other beings.

                                    Combat: Four times per day gorgons can make a breath weapon attack(their preferred means of attack).Their breath shoots forth in a truncated cone, five feet wide at the base and 20 feet wide at its end, with a maximum range of 60 feet.Any creature caught in

                                    Gorgons are usually encountered in groups of three or four— one male bull with two or three females.Gorgon calves are raised by the females to the age of two, then the young bulls are turned out to make their own way.Females remain with the dominant bull.

                                    About 25 % of the time only a single gorgon is encountered.Lone gorgons are always rogue males in search of females.

                                    Half - lion, half - eagle, griffons are ferocious avian carnivores that prey upon horses and their kin(hippogriffs, pegasi, and uni -
                                        corns), This hunger
                                    for horseflesh often brings griffons into direct conflict with humans and demihumans.

                                    Adult griffons stand five feet at the shoulder and weigh over half aton.Their head, upper torso, and forelegs are like those of a giant eagle.This eagle half is covered in golden feathers from its wing tips to its razor - sharp beak.Their powerful forelimbs end in
                                    long, hooked talons.Wings, with a span of 25 feet or more, rise out of their backs, The lower half of a griffon is that of a lion.Dusky yellow fur covers the lion half 's muscular rear legs and
                                    clawed feet.A lion 's tail hangs down from the griffon'
                                    s powerful rear haunches.Griffons speak no languages, but emit an eagle -
                                    like screech when angered or excited(usually by the smell of horse).

                                    Combat: Griffons hunt in groups of 12 or less, searching the plains and forests near(within 20 miles) their lair
                                    for horses and herd animals.With their superior vision and sense of smell, grif -
                                    fons can spot prey up to two miles distant.If the prey is horse or horse - kin, griffons are 90 % likely to attack even
                                    if the horses have riders.Griffons hunt only
                                    for food, so a rider who releases one or two horses can usually escape unharmed(though in all likelihood his horse won 't). Any attempt to protect a horse brings
                                        the full fury of the attacking griffons on the protector.

                                        When attacking ground targets, griffons use their great size and weight to swoop down from above and raking their opponent with the talons before landing nearby.Griffons always fight to the death
                                        if there is horseflesh at stake.

                                        In aerial combat, griffons are equally fierce, lunging into battle and tearing at their opponent until they or their prey are dead.Many a griffon has plummeted to its death with a struggling hip -
                                        pogriff caught firmly in its grasp.

                                        Habitat / Society: Griffons prefer rocky habitats, near open plains, Once griffons establish their territory, they remain until the food supply has been exhausted.

                                        Griffons, like lions, live in prides, with each pride comprising several mated pairs, their young, and one dominant male.The dominant male is responsible
                                        for settling territorial disputes with







                                        other prides and choosing the direction the hunt will take.

                                        Each pair of mated griffons in the pride has its own nest, lo -
                                        cated near the pride 's other lairs. Griffon nests are usually situ-
                                        ated in shallow caves high along a cliff face.

                                        The nests are made of sticks and leaves, as well as an occasional bone.Griffons collect no treasure, but their caves frequently con -
                                        tain the remains of unfortunate travelers who tried to protect their horses from the griffons.

                                        During spring, female griffons lay one or two eggs that hatch in
                                        the late summer.For the first three months griffon young are known as hatchlings; thereafter until they mature the young are called fledglings.Griffon young grow rapidly
                                        for three years until they are large enough to hunt with the pride.Adult griffons are extremely protective of their young and attack without mercy any creature that approaches within 100 feet of the nest.

                                        Ecology: If trained from a very early age(three years or less),
                                        griffons will serve as mounts.The training, however, is both time - consuming and expensive, requiring the expertise of an ani -

                                        for two years.Once trained, though, griffons make fierce and loyal steeds, bonding with one master
                                        for life, and pro -
                                        tecting him even unto death.A griffon mount knows no fear in
                                        battle, but attacks any horse or horse - kin in preference to other opponents.

                                        Acquiring a griffon fledgling is a very dangerous venture as the adults never stray far from the nest and fight to the death to de -

                                        The groaning spirit, or banshee, is the spirit of an evil female el {—
                                            a very rare thing indeed.Groaning spirits hate the living, finding
                                            their presence painful, and seek to harm whomever they meet.

                                            Groaning spirits appear as floating, luminous phantasms of
                                            their former selves.Their image glows brightly at night, but is
                                            transparent in sunlight(60 % invisible).Most groaning spirits are
                                            old and withered, but a few(10 % ) who died young retain their
                                            former beauty.The hair of a groaning spirit is wild and unkempt.
                                            Her dress is usually tattered rags.Her face is a mask of pain and
                                            anguish, but hatred and ire burns brightly in her eyes.Groaning
                                            spirits frequently cry out in pain— hence their name.

                                            Combat: Groaning spirits are formidable opponents.The mere
                                            sight of one causes fear, unless a successful saving
                                            throw vs, spell
                                            is rolled.Those who fail must flee in terror
                                            for 10 rounds and are
                                            50 % likely to drop any items they were carrying in their hands.

                                            A groaning spirit 's most dreaded weapon is its wail or keen.
                                            Any creature within 30 feet of a groaning spirit when she keens
                                            must roll a saving

                                            spirits can keen just once per day, and then only at night.The
                                            touch of a groaning spirit causes 1 d8 points of damage.

                                            highly resistant to magic(50 % ), They are fully immune to charm,

                                            Holy water causes 2 d4 points of damage
                                            if broken upon them.An
                                            dispel evil spell will kill a groaning spirit.A groaning spirit is
                                            turned as a“ special” undead.

                                            Groaning spirits can sense the presence of living creatures up to
                                            five miles away.Any creature that remains within five miles of a
                                            groaning spirit lair is sure to be attacked when night falls, The na -

                                                ing characters are killed via a touch, Adventurers or demihumans
                                            are attacked by keening.Creatures powerful enough to withstand
                                            the groaning spirit 's keen are left alone.

                                            When attacking adventurers, the groaning spirit attacks at
                                            night with her wail.If any characters save successfully, she then
                                            retreats to her lair.Thereafter, each night, the groaning spirit re -
                                                turns to wail again.This routine is repeated until all of the victims





                                            are dead or have left the groaning spirit 's domain, or until the
                                            groaning spirit is slain,

                                            Habitat / Society: Groaning spirits loathe all living things and
                                            thus make their homes in desolate countryside or ancient ruins.
                                            There they hide by day, when they cannot keen, and wander the
                                            surrounding countryside by night.The land encircling a groaning
                                            spirit 's lair is strewn with the bones of beasts who heard the
                                            groaning spirit’ s cry.Once a groaning spirit establishes her lair she
                                            will remain there.

                                            The treasure of groaning spirits varies considerably and often
                                            reflects what they loved in lite.Many hoard gold and fine gems.
                                            Other groaning spirits, particularly those that haunt their former
                                            homes, show finer tastes, preserving great works of art and sculp -
                                                tures, or powerful magical items.

                                            It is nearly impossible to distinguish the cry of a groaning spirit
                                            from that of a human or elf woman in pain.Many a knight gal -
                                                lant has mistaken the two sounds, and then paid
                                            for the mistake
                                            with his life.Groaning spirits are exceptionally intelligent and
                                            speak numerous languages, including common, elvish, and other
                                            demihuman languages.

                                            Groaning spirits occasionally use their destructive powers to
                                            seek revenge against their former adversaries in life.

                                            Ecology: Groaning spirits are a blight upon wherever they set -
                                                tle.They kill without discretion, and their only pleasure is the
                                            misfortune and misery of others.In addition to slaying both man
                                            and beast, a groaning spirit 's keen has a powerful effect upon veg-
                                            etation.Flowers and delicate plants wither and die and trees grow
                                            twisted and sickly,
                                            while hardier plants, thistles and the like,
                                            flourish.After a few years all that remains within five miles of a
                                            groaning spirit’ s lair is a desolate wilderness of warped trees and
                                            thorns mixed with the bones of those creatures that dared to cross
                                            into the groaning spirit’ s domain.

                                        These daemons are summoned by evil wizards or priests to guard something of importance, Guardian daemons always defend their charge with great ferocity.

                                        There are three types of guardian daemons— least, lesser, and greater.The least and lesser guardian daemons vary in size and form, often being horned and frog - like(least) or ape - or boar - like(lesser).Greater guardian daemons always appear as gigantic,
                                        winged bears with ram horns protruding from their foreheads,
                                        and eagle talons
                                        for hands.

                                        Guardian daemons have the ability to speak all languages.

                                        Least Daemon

                                        These creatures are often summoned to protect treasures valued at less than 25, 000 gold pieces.Least daemons have a 50 % chance of being immune to one additional type of attack.

                                        Hags are witch - like beings that spread havoc and destruction,
                                        working their magics, and slaying all whom they encounter.

                                        Hags appear as wretched old women, with long, frayed hair,
                                        and withered faces.Horrid moles and warts dot their blotchy skin, their mouths are filled with blackened teeth, and their breath is most foul.Though wrinkled and skinny, hags possess supernatural strength and can easily crush smaller creatures, such as goblins, with one hand.Similarly, though hags look decrepit,
                                        they run swiftly, easily bounding over rocks or logs in their path.From the long, skinny fingers of hags grow iron - like claws.Hags use these claws(and their supernatural strength) to rend and tear at opponents in combat, Their garb is similar to that of peasant women, but usually much more tattered and filthy.

                                        Combat: The combat abilities of hags vary with each type(see below
                                            for details), but all hags possess the following: 18 / 00 Strength or greater, some level of magic resistance, and the spell -

                                        and so on.

                                        The one weakness of hags is their arrogance.Hags have great disdain
                                        for the mental abilities of all humans and demihumans and,
                                        though hags are masterful employers of disguise, clever characters may be able to glean a hag 's true nature through conversation.

                                        for hags, but giants are treated with respect(
                                            for obvious reasons) and often cooperate with hags to accom -
                                        plish acts of great evil against the outside world,

                                        While individually powerful, hags are much more dangerous when formed into a covey.A covey is composed of three hags of any combination(e.g., two annis and a green hag, three annis, etc.),
                                        Coveys have special powers that individual hags don 't possess.
                                        These powers include the following spells: curse, polymorph other.animate dead, dream, control weather, veil, forcecage, vision, and mind blank.Covey spells can each be used once per day, and take ef -

                                        if they were cast by a 9 th - level spellcaster.To cast one of these spells, the members of the covey must all be within 10 feet of each other and the spell being cast must be in lieu of all other attacks.

                                        Coveys never cast these spells in combat, instead these spells are used to help weave wicked plots against neighboring human or demihuman settlements.A common ploy by coveys is to force or trick a victim into performing some heinous deed.This deed usually involves bringing back more victims, some of whom are devoured by the hags; the rest are used on further evil assign -

                                        A covey of hags is 80 % likely to be guarded by a mixture of 1 d8 ogres and 1 d4 evil giants.Coveys often use one or two of their ogres as spies, sending them into the world beyond after poly -

                                        These minions frequently(60 % ) wear a special magical gem called a hag eve.A hag eye is made from the real eye of a covey 's
                                        previous victim.It appears to the casual observer to be no more than a low - value gem(20 gp or less), but
                                        if viewed through a gem of true seeing, a disembodied eye can be seen trapped in the hag eye 's interior. This hidden eye is magically connected to the covey
                                        that created the hag eye.All three members of the covey can see whatever the hag eve is pointed at.Hag eyes are usually placed on a medallion or brooch worn by one of the hag’ s polymorphed ser -
                                        vants.Occasionally hag eyes are given as gifts to unsuspecting victims whom the hags want to monitor.Destroying a hag eye in -

                                        for 24 hours.

                                        Hags commonly inhabit bone - strewn glens deep within forests.There is an 80 % chance that hags are keeping one or two captives in a nearby earthen pit or forcecage.These prisoners are held fora purpose known only to the hags themselves, though it will cer -
                                        tainly involve spreading chaos into the outside world.Prisoners kept in a pit are guarded by an evil giant or one to two ogres; those in a forcecage are left alone.

                                        Ecology: Hags have a ravenous appetite and are able to devour man - sized creatures in just 10 rounds.They prefer human flesh,

                                        Hags hoard fine treasure, using the jewelry and coins to deco -
                                        rate the bones of their more powerful victims, and the finer gems(S00 gp value or higher) to manufacture magical hag eyes.

                                        Annis

                                        The largest and most powerful of all the hags, annis stand seven to eight feet tall.Their skin is deep blue in complexion,
                                        while their hair, teeth, and nails are glossy black.The eyes of an annis are dull green or yellow.Annis have normal infravision(60 - foot range), but superior hearing and sense of smell.Annis are sur -

                                        nis is slain, or the victim uses some magical means to escape the hag.Otherwise, the annis will
                                        continue to hold the victim in its grasp, and deliver damage with its raking talons and sharpened teeth each round until the victim is slain.

                                        In addition to normal attacks, annis have the ability to cast fog cloud three times per day.This spell is used to confuse resistance or to delay attack by a superior foe.Annis can also change self like all hags, appearing as a tall human, ogre, or even a small gi -
                                        ant, These spells are cast at 8 th level
                                        for purposes of determining spell range, duration, etc.

                                        The skin of an annis is iron - hard; thus edged weapons cause 1

                                        less point of damage when they hit these hags.Conversely, blunt weapons(including morning stars) cause 1 additional point of damage against an annis.

                                        Annis speak their own language, as well as ogre, all evil giant tongues, and some common.Some of the most intelligent annis can speak common fluently and know a smattering of various de -
                                        mihuman languages.Annis are believed to live

                                        These wretched creatures live in desolate countryside and amid dense forests and swamps.Greenhags, as their name implies,
                                        have a sickly green pallor.Hair color ranges from near black to olive green, and their eyes are amber or orange.Their skin ap -

                                        greenhags impose a - 5 penalty to an opponent 's surprise roll when in a forest or swamp.They have superior hearing, smell, and sight, including infravision(90 - foot range).They are only sur -

                                        Rock - hard talons grow from the long, slender fingers of greenhags.They use these talons to slash and rend their oppo -
                                        nents.Smaller than their annis cousins, greenhags nonetheless possess Strength equivalent to that of an ogre(18 / 00), Because of their great Strength, all their attack rolls gain a + 3 bonus and all hits receive a + 6 damage bonus.

                                        Greenhags can cast the following spells at will, one spell per round: audible glamor, dancing lights, invisibility, pass without trace, change self, speak with monsters, water breathing, and weakness.Each spell is employed at 9 th level of ability.

                                        To lure victims, greenhags typically use their mimic ability.This enables them to imitate the voice of a mature or immature male or female, human or demihuman.Calls
                                        for help and crying are common deceptions employed by greenhags.They are also able to mimic most animals.

                                        Greenhags speak their own language(a dialect of annis) as well as all demihuman languages and common.These are the longest lived of all hags— they can live
                                        for up to 1, 000 years.

                                        These, the most wretched of all hags, inhabit thickly vegetated shallows in warm seas and, very rarely, overgrown lakes.Warts,
                                        bony protrusions, and patches of slimy green scales dot their sickly yellow skin.Their eyes are always red with deep, black pu -

                                        can cast a deadly glance up to three times a day.This look affects one creature of the sea hag 's choosing within 30 feet. To negate the

                                        for sea hags quickly devour their helpless victims.

                                        Sea hags always use their deadly glance as their primary form of attack; they will melee, but only
                                        if they have the advantage of numbers.Unlike other hags, sea hags use daggers in combat, re -

                                        Sea hags speak their own language as well as common and the languages of annis, and sea elves, and live
                                        for 800 years.

                                            for the haunt when in a possessed victim.)

                                        A haunt is the restless spirit of a person who died leaving some vi -
                                        tal task unfinished, The haunt 's sole purpose is to take over a liv-
                                        ing body and use it to complete the task, thus gaining a final release from this world.

                                        Haunts can assume either of two forms, at will: a hovering lu -
                                        minescent ball of light(identical in appearance to a will - o - wisp) or a nebulous, translucent image of the haunt 's former body. In
                                        the later state, haunts look very similar to groaning spirits, spec -
                                        tres, or ghosts, and are often mistaken
                                        for such.Transformation from one state to the other takes one round.

                                        Combat: A haunt must remain within 60 yards of where it last died, unless it controls a victim 's body. This 60-yard radius is
                                        called the haunt 's domain.

                                        A haunt attacks mindlessly, always targeting the first human or demihuman that enters its domain, A haunt continues to attack that individual until possession is achieved or the individual leaves the haunt 's territory.

                                        The touch of a haunt drains 2 points of Dexterity per hit.As the character 's Dexterity is drained, he suffers not only the penalties
                                        of lowered Dexterity, but he feels an increasing numbness creep -
                                        ing over his body.If the character 's Dexterity reaches 0, the haunt
                                        steps into the body and possesses it.Once the body is possessed,
                                        Dexterity returns to normal.

                                        The haunt uses the host body to complete its unfulfilled task,
                                        which need not be dangerous(though it often is).Once the task is completed, the haunt passes on to its final rest, and the victim re -
                                        gains control of his body.When the haunt leaves a victim, the character has a Dexterity of 3. Lost Dexterity points are regained at the rate of 1 point
                                        for each turn of complete rest.If a haunt 's
                                        possessed body is slain, it will haunt the place where the body was killed.

                                        If the victim has an alignment opposite to that of the haunt(good vs.evil), the haunt will
                                        try to strangle the victim using the

                                2 on the second, 4 on the third, and so on, doubling each round until the victim is dead or the haunt is driven off,

                                Any attacks on a possessed character cause full damage to the character 's body. If attacked the haunt defends itself using what-
                                ever weapons and armor the victim carries; the haunt cannot use any items that would require special knowledge(spells, scrolls,
                                    rings, etc.).The only safe way to free the victim is by casting one of the following spells— hold person or dispel evil(good).If hold person is cast, the haunt must roll a successful saving

                                Haunts are linked to the site of their deaths and therefore can -

                                    sessing someone) haunts can be struck only by silver or magical weapons or by fire.Weapons cause only 1 point of damage, plus their magical bonus(
                                    if any).Normal fire causes 1 point of dam -

                                Habitat / Society: The exact task to be accomplished varies, but the motives are always powerful(revenge, unfulfilled greed,
                                    love, and so forth).Often great distances need to be traveled be -

                                for the haunt to resist.

                                Ecology: Haunts cling to this world by force of will alone.They have no treasure of their own unless it is connected to their quest.They prey only on humans and demihumans.

                                Hawks are common throughout the world, from tropic to subarc -
                                tic regions.They live mainly on vermin and rodents and thus are thought well of in many areas.

                                Hawks are smaller than eagles, Their wingspan measures up to five feet from wing tip to wing tip.Coloration varies from species to species with red - brown to dark brown being most common.

                                Large hawks have been known to attack small demihumans,
                                though such occurrences are extremely rare.

                                Combat: Hawks attack via plummeting dives, usually from a height of 100 feet or more.This dive gives them a + 2 bonus to their attack roll and their momentum enables their talons to in -
                                flict twice the normal damage.Hawks cannot attack with their beaks on the round they engage in a dive attack.

                                After the initial dive, hawks fight by biting and pecking with

                                their beaks and tearing at their opponents with their talons.Hawks always target the eyes and they have a 25 % probability of striking an opponent 's eye whenever their beaks hit, Opponents
                                struck in the eye are blinded
                                for 1 d10 rounds and have a 10 %
                                chance of losing vision permanently in that eye, Because of their superior eyesight, hawks can never be surprised.Habitat / Society; Hawks make their nests in tall trees or hidden among rocky slopes.There the female lays one to three eggs in
                                early spring.The eggs hatch by summer 's end and thereafter both
                                the male and female work feeding the fledglings, beeting them up before winter arrives.

                                During the fledglings’ first nine months, one of the adult hawks is usually(80 % ) within sight of their nest.Any intruder threaten -
                                ing the nest is attacked
                                if seen, regardless of size.

                                Ecology: If taken
                                while young and trained by an expert, hawks can be taught to hunt.Because of this many animal trainers pay well
                                for healthy fledglings.The price
                                for a fledgling is about 500 gold pieces on the open market.Trained hawks sell
                                for as much as 1, 200 gold pieces each.

                                Falcon

                                Falcons are smaller, swifter, and more maneuverable than hawks.These birds of prey are more easily trained and are often prefer -
                                red by hunters over hawks.Their nesting habits are similar to those of hawks, though many species roost underground.Trained falcons sell
                                for around 1, 000 gp each.

                                Blood Hawk

                                Blood hawks resemble normal hawks in size alone, as their beaks are razor sharp and their talons unusually strong.Their feathers are a mottled grey.Large and powerfully built wings provide these killers with great speed and maneuverability when flying.These birds of prey hunt in small flocks and are fond of human flesh.They will
                                continue to attack humans even
                                if a melee is going against them and will
                                break off very reluctantly.

                                Male blood hawks kill humans not only
                                for food but also
                                for gems, with which they line their nests as an allurement to females.All other types of treasure are ignored by blood hawks.Hell Hound

                                Combat: Hel] hounds are clever hunters that operate in packs.They do not bay like normal dogs
                            while hunting.They move with great stealth, imposing a - 5 penalty to opponents’ surprise rolls.One or two of the pack sneak up on a quarry
                            while the others form a ring around it.The first hell hound then springs from am -
                            bush, attacks the nearest victim, and attempts to drive the others toward the rest of the pack.If the prey does not run away, the rest of the pack closes in within 1 d4 + 2 rounds, If hell hounds are pur -
                            suing fleeing prey, they might bay.

                            Hell hounds attack first by breathing fire at an opponent up to 10 yards away.The fire causes 1 point of damage
                            for each of the hell hound '’s Hit Dice. A successful saving throw vs. breath
                            weapon cuts the damage in half.The hell hound then attacks with its teeth.The hell hound can

                            ing.If the hell hound rolls a natural 20 on its attack roll, it grabs a victim in its jaws and breathes fire on the victim.

                            Hell hounds have a variety of defenses.They are immune to fire, Their keen hearing means they are surprised only ona 1 or 2 on 1 d10.They can also see hidden or invisible creatures 50 % of the time.

                            Habitat / Society: He]] hounds are native to those extradimen -
                    sional planes notable
                    for their hot, fiery landscapes.There they roam in packs of 2 d20 beasts.The hell hounds on the Prime Mate -
                    rial plane are summoned there to serve the needs of evil creatures.Most of them later escape to the wild.

                    Hell hounds may have 4 to 7(1 d4. + 3) Hit Dice.The more Hit Dice a hell hound has, the larger it is and the more damage it causes.Each pack is led by a 7 - Hit Die hell hound.The leader











                    drives off other 7 HD rivals, who form their own packs.

                    The diet of hell hounds is similar to that of normal canines,
                    They roam a wide area of 1 d10 + 4 square miles centered on their den.Pack territories may overlap.

                    They do not easily reproduce on the Prime Material plane.
                    Only 5 % of encounters include puppies.Such puppies are born in
                    litters of 2 d4, They burp flame uncontrollably at least once a day.The flames are harmless aside from the tendency to set fire to any -
                    thing flammable in the area.Newborn puppies are at 10 % of the adult growth; they quickly grow an additional 5 % each month and reach full adult growth(4 HD) in 11 / 2 years.While growing they can attack with their incendiary bite.Hell hound puppies up to two months old inflict 1 point of damage.Older ones add an additional 1 point
                    for each additional six months of growth.

                    Prey is usually eaten where it is slain, though hell hounds occa -
                    sionally haul a carcass back to their den
                    for later meals.Hell hounds are also similar to normal canines in that they may act as retrievers.Some objects are specifically sought; this is especially the
                case intrained hell hounds.Other hell hounds are simply playful and use the retrieved items as toys.They especially like noisy bags and pouches filled with their late victims’ treasures.Flammable containers eventually burn and spill their contents in
                or around the den.Parchments are rarely found here unless pro -
                tected by nonflammable containers.

                Ecology:
                    Hell hounds have little place in the ecology of the nor -
                    mal world.They are dangerous annoyances prone to cause fires wherever they hunt.Hell hounds cause more forest fires than any other creature except
                    for humanoids.Hell hounds have their uses,
                    though, Because of their ability to easily detect hidden or invisi -
                    ble creatures, hel] hounds make excellent watch dogs, especially
            for intelligent monsters such as fire giants.

            Hell hounds can be domesticated
            if raised from puppies, but there is a 10 % chance each year that domesticated hell hounds go wild,

            The heucuva is an undead spirit similar in appearance to a skele -
            ton, but more dangerous and more difficult to dispel.

            The heucuva appears to be a humanoid skeleton of normal size, The bones are covered by a rabe that is little more than tat -
            tered rags.

            Combat: The heucuva attacks by swiping with one of its hands; the sharp finger bones are capable of tearing into wood, A victim must roll a successful saving
            throw vs.poison or be afflicted with
            a disease, The victim suffers a daily loss of 1 point each of Strength and Constitution.A cure disease spell must be cast on the victim to prevent death and restore the lost points.

            Heucuva are treated as wights on the Turning Undead table.They are resistant to all mind - influencing spells.Heucuva bones soon crumble once the monsters are destroyed.

            Heucuva have a special hatred of priests.Once a priest uses his spells or tries to turn the heucuva, they will concentrate on at -
            tacking that priest.They may even ignore everyone
            else except
            for the priest and those defending him.

            Heucuva are able to polymorph themselves up to three times a day.They may use this power to assume a nonthreatening shape in order to get close to an unsuspecting victim or avoid an unde -
            sired encounter when pursuing a specific prey, Heucuva may as -
            sume the form of people they have met in the recent past, such as a past victim or a member of the party that encounters the mon -

            pear to be pilgrims in procession.Such disguises fool only those who view the world solely via visible light; heucuva appear the same as other skeletal undead
            if looked at with infravision.The heucuva are incapable of speech; they can only moan or wail.

            Habitat / Society: Heucuva roam the dark places of the world.They can be found in subterranean realms, as well as most tem -
            perate or tropical regions.Cold seems to prevent heucuvan activ -
            ity,
            for they are not found in high, desolate mountains or in any cold regions.

            Legends tell that heucuva are the restless spirits of monastic priests who were less than faithful to their holy vows.In punish -
            ment
            for their heresies, they are forced to roam the dark.Their

            ognizable remains of their monks’ robes.Instead of healing, they can kill with a diseased touch.Instead of helping others, they seek to kill all who still live.Even their old power to turn undead is now used to help them resist the efforts of others to turn them.

            Heucuva retain dim memories of their old lives.Their lairs are decorated as grotesque mockeries of their old abbeys and tem -
            ples.The corpses of past victims may be used to represent parish -
            ioners.These corpses may retain their original possessions, which may represent a large portion of the heucuvan treasure trove.Other accumulated treasures may be scattered around the mock altar as decorations or offerings.Such a mock temple is a chilling sight to most and an abomination that few good - aligned cleric can resist destroying.

            Some heucuva are nomadic and constantly wander on a pil -
            grimage to nowhere.Even these are mockeries of real pilgrim -
            ages.

            Ecology: Heucuva are malignant spirits that seek to destroy those who still live.They are used as examples to remind priests the fate that befalls those who stray from their devotion or use their religion as a mask to hide unpious deeds.Powdered heucuva bones may be used in the preparation of magical items intended to corrupt the spirits of living beings or to control undead.

            The hippocampus is the most prized of the marine steeds, a crea -
            ture that combines features of a horse and a fish,

            The hippocampus has the head, forelegs, and torso of a horse.The equine section is covered with short hair.The mane is made of long, flexible fins.The front hooves are replaced by webbed fins that fold up as the leg moves forward, then fans out as the leg strokes back.Past the rib cage the body becomes fish - like.The tail tapers 14 feet into a wide horizontal fin.A dorsal fin is located on the rump.Coloration is that of seawater.Typical colors in -
            clude ivory, pale green, pale blue, aqua, deep blue, and deep green.

            Combat: Hippocampi are usually peaceful creatures.They do
                not attack unless cornered or
            if another hippocampus or an ally is threatened.They are fast enough to out - swim most anything that would want to attack them.

            The hippocampus attacks with a strong bite.It suddenly ex -
            tends its head, chomps down with a crushing bite, and then re -
            leases.Hippocampi do not hold onto their opponents.

            Hippocampi also butt their heads against targets.Such attacks may stun an opponent or
            break his bones.

            Their firm, powerfully muscled bodies provide a strong protec -
            tion against attack.The blood coagulates quickly on exposure to water, thus minimizing blood loss that could both debilitate the hippocampus and attract sharks(sharks have only a 20 % chance of going into a feeding frenzy
                if the only bleeding creature is a hip -
                pocampus).

            Habitat / Society: Hippocampi are the prized steeds of the sea,
            They can be found in deep waters anywhere, in freshwater lakes and oceans.They are able to breathe fresh and salt water with equal ease.They can also breathe air but require frequent gulps of water to keep from drying out.They are unable to move out of water.

            Despite their radically different environments, horses and hip -
            pocampi are very similar, They have approximately the same sizes, life spans, and personalities, although hippocampi are blessed with much higher intelligence.

            Hippocampi are herbivores.They normally graze on seaweed and other soft vegetation.If their usual fodder is unavailable,















            their strong teeth can chew up mollusks and coral.

            Wild hippocampi roam in herds of 2 d4.These are usually a stallion, 1 d4 mares, and the rest young hippocampi of either sex.Hippocampus mares lay a single, large egg.After six months, the egg hatches a single foal.Twins are extremely rare(1 % chance).The foals grow quickly in two years.The yearlings are physically the equals of the adults.Hippocampian tales speak of a“ Great Herd” of hundreds or thousands of hippocampi that roams the uncharted reaches of the far seas.No non - hippocampi have ever seen this spectacle.

            Hippocampi may be“ domesticated” by water - breathing hu -

            tion.The benevolent hippocampi may assist surface dwellers who are visiting the aquatic world, whether voluntarily or by ac -
            cident.Many a shipwrecked sailor has been saved from drowning by a passing hippocampus.Hippocampi are good judges of char -
            acter; they will not assist an evil being or anyone who acts in a hostile manner toward them.Sometimes a hippocampus 's offer of
            a ride can be more trouble than it is worth.Young hippocampi of -
            ten forget that most surface dwellers breathe air, not water.

            Hippocampi do not accumulate treasure.Most spurn even or -
                namental gifts such as collars or leg bands.They simply have no
            use
            for these gewgaws.They do appreciate delicacies, however, in the forms of tasty foods not available in the water.

            Ecology: Hippocampi are one of the most successful of the intel -
            ligent, good - aligned marine monsters.They maintain ties with mermen and sea elves, as well as surface dwellers who make their living in the water.They provide valuable services as steeds,
            guides, and allies.Hippocampus eggs sell
            for 1, 500 gp.Young hip -
            pocampi are worth 2, 500 gp.However, surface dwellers who have been saved by hippocampi remain so grateful to their former rescuers that they may attack any merchant selling eggs or foals in a public market and attempt to
            return the hippocampi to
            the sea.

                Hippogriffs are flying monsters that have an equal likelihood to be predator, prey, or steed,

                The hippogriff is a monstrous hybrid of eagle and equine fea -
                tures, It has the ears, neck, mane, torso, and hind legs of a horse.The wings, forelegs, and face are those of an eagle.It is about the size of a light riding horse.A hippogriff may be colored russet,
                golden tan, or a variety of browns.The feathers are usually a dit -
                ferent shade than the hide.The beak is ivory or golden yellow.

                Combat: The hippogriff attacks with its eagle - like claws and beak.Each claw can tear
                for 1 d6 points of damage,
                while the scissor - like beak inflicts 1 d10 points of damage.

                Habitat / Society: ; Hippogriffs preter the desolate sections of the temperate and tropic regions, especially rolling hills that enable them to get quickly airborne.

                Hippogrifts are territorial.They have a preferred grazing and hunting area that covers 1 d4 x 10 square miles.Somewhere in this territory is a naturally protected site that serves as the hippogriff nest.Here is where the young hippogriffs stay.The nest is always guarded,

                The typical hippogriff herd includes 1 - 3 adult males, an equal number of mares, and the rest are immature young.There is a 25 % chance that one or more of the mares is pregnant.Gestation takes 10 months, During the first five months, this occurs within the mare.Then she lays an egg that hatches in another five months, Twin births are rare(1 % chance).

                The foal is able to walk upon hatching.Its beak remains soft
                for the first two weeks; this enables the foal to nurse.Then its beak hardens and the hippogriff switches to regurgitated food from its mother.The colts learn to eat solid meat at four months, although they are clumsy killers(-4 penalty to attack rolls and damage).At six months they can fly(18, class D) and fight with a - 2 penalty to attack rolls and damage.Yearlings are identical to adults, al -
                though they are unable to breed until they are three years old.

                Wild hippogriffs are omnivorous.They feed on whatever is available, whether greenery, fruits, or wildlife.Hippogriffts are able to attack fairly large prey, such as bison, but they do not prey
                on carnivores.The exception is humanoids.Hippogriffs may, in
                the absence of other meat, attack small groups of people.Bodies











                are then carried back to the nest to feed the others; this is where the victim 's possessions usually spill out. Hippogriffs are clean
                monsters; they dispose of carcasses and other debris by carrying them downhill.They like clear, sparkly things like glass, crystals,
                and precious gems.Males may amass a small trove kept covered by brush, As a mating ritual, he arranges these in a display to en -
                tice mares.

                Ecology: Hippogriffs are closely related to griffons.Just as grif -
                fons are the result of crossing an eagle with a lion, hippogriffs re -
                sulted from the crossing of an eagle with a horse.Hippogriffs may have been created as a natural prey
                for the griffons.Fortunately
                for the hippogriff, its own formidable weapons give it a fighting chance.To make up
                for the griffon 's superiority, hippogriffs
                gather in larger groups.

                Hippogriffs are also related to pegasi.Because the hippogriffs eat meat, pegasi avoid their company.

                Hippogriffs make excellent flying mounts.The maneuverabil -
                ity decreases to Class D, but their speed is unimpaired.They are less likely to eat the rider than a griffon is.

                If a hippogriff is captured
                while still very young(under four months), it can be domesticated and trained to serve as a steed.Hippogriff eggs sell
                for 1, 000 gp, young hippogriffs
                for 2, 000 -
                3, 000 gp.It will probably have to be taught to fly.Domestic hip -
                pogriffs are also taught to recognize a limited number of species as food; humanoids of course are not on that list.Hippogriffs have difficulty breeding in captivity.Like flying, the wild hippo -
                griff has to be captured before such skills are learned.Mature hip -
                pogriffs may be persuaded to voluntarily assist riders who can provide them with ample food or protection.

            Jermlaine are a diminutive humanoid race that dwells in tunnels and ambushes hapless adventurers.They are known by a variety of names such as jinxkin or bane - midges.

            Jermlaine appear to be tiny humans dressed in baggy clothing and leather helmets.In fact the“ clothing” is their own saggy skin and pointed heads.The limbs are knottily muscled.The finger -
            nails and toenails are thick and filthy, although the fingers and toes are very nimble.Their gray - brown, warty hide blends in
            with natural earth and stone.When they wear rags or scraps as clothing, such items are also camouflage colored.

            They speak in high - pitched squeaks and twitters.This speech may be mistaken
            for the sounds of a bat or rat.They can also con -
            verse with all sorts of rats, both normal and monstrous.Each jermlaine has a 10 % chance to understand common, dwarvish,
            gnomish, goblin, or orc(roll separately
                for each language).

            Combat: Jermlaine are cowards who have made an art of the ambush.They only attack when they feel there is no serious op -
            position.They prefer to attack injured, ill, or sleeping victims.They avoid directly confronting strong, alert parties, although they may
            try to injure them out of sheer maliciousness.Jermlaine possess weak eyes and infravision that only extends
            for 30 yards,
            but their keen smell and hearing enable them to detect even invisi -
            ble creatures 50 % of the time.Jermlaine move silently and quickly, with a scuttling gait(this stealth causes opponents to sut -
                ter a - 5 penalty to their surprise rolls).They are 75 % undetect -
            able, even
            if listened or watched
            for, unless the jermlaine purposefully reveal their presence.

            Jermlaine typically arm themselves with needle - sharp darts; they can hurl these 120 yards
            for 1 - 2 points of damage.They also carry a miniature pike; these 1!/2-foot-long sticks with sharp tips
            inflict 1 d4 points of damage.If the jermlaines are out to capture a victim, they are also armed with blackjacks.

            The jermlaines’ favorite tactic is capturing victims with nets or pits.In little - used passages the creatures prepare pits covered by camouflaged doors or string nets overhead, In more - traveled pas -
            sages, the jermlaine stretch trip cords, When a victim falls afoul of a trap, the jermlaine swarm over him, Some pummel him with blackjacks
            while others tie him with ropes and cords.Such beat -









            ings have a cumulative 2 % chance per blow of causing the victim to lapse into unconsciousness.If a victim is wearing splint,
            banded, or plate mail, these pummeling attacks are ineffective,
            Knowing this, the jermlaine attack well - armored victims with acid or flaming oil missiles.

            Slain victims and 5 % of subdued victims are later devoured by the jermlaine and their rats.Most captives are robbed, stripped,
            shaved totally hairless, and left trussed in a passageway.If an un -
            suspecting victim pauses near a lurking band of jermlaine, they dart out and cut straps, belts, packs, and pouches.Each jermlaine in the band makes one such attack before fleeing back into the shadows.Such attacks are usually not noticed till 1 d12 turns later, when the slashed items begin to fall apart.They also
            try to steal, damage, or befoul victims’ possessions.

            When encountered, 25 % of jermlaine are accompanied by 1 d6 rats and 50 % are accompanied by 1 dé6 giant rats(only one type of rat per group of jermlaine), Groups of 35 or more jermlaine are accompanied by an elder— a very old jermlaine with the magical ability to drain the magic from most magical items
            if he can han -
            dle such an object
            for 1 d4 rounds.Artifacts and relics are immune to such attacks,

            Jermlaine are treated as 4 - Hit Die monsters
            for purposes of sav -
            ing throws and magical attacks.Due to their diminutive size, they escape all damage from attacks that normally do half damage
            if the saving
            throw is successful.

            Habitat / Society: Jermlaine are extremely distant relatives of the gnomes.Their deeply rooted sense of inferiority at their own di -
            minutive size has become a malicious need to humiliate normal -
            sized humanoids.They make a good living preying on hapless adventurers, who provide riches, sadistic amusement, and an oc -
            casional meal.Jermlaine acquire a wide variety of treasure, al -
            though such items tend to be small objects.

            The jermlaine life span is one third that of humans.Reproduc -
            tion is identical to other humanoids, although cross breeding is impossible.Jermlaine females give birth to one or two babies at a time.Most(75 % ) of the offspring are male, although the dangers of their hostile life reduces the male numerical superiority to an even male - female mix among the adults.

            Jermlaine society is divided among clans whose members are


            

            Jermlaine

            united by blood.Each clan consists of 4 d4 families.The clan chiet is normally the strongest or most clever of the elders.The chief both instructs the young jermlaine in the art of the ambush and leads important attacks(albeit from a secure location in the rear).The families center around the mothers, as the fathers may be un -
            known, off hunting, or dead.If a female jermlaine has dependent children, she normally concentrates on raising such children rather than participating in attacks, As the children mature, she and the clan chief take the young on practice attacks on potential victims and participate in the humiliation of captives.

            Jermiaine lairs are cunningly hidden and physically impassable by most humanoids, as they are usually a series of small cham -
            bers and tunnels scaled to their tiny occupants.The typical jerm -
            laine lair is a filthy cave or burrow a short distance from a larger cavern complex.The only areas that can be easily reached by a human - sized being are the areas in which living captives are held and dead victims butchered
            for food.Access past this area is con -
            trolled by small, one - foot - high corridors or thin, normally im -
            passable cracks in the rock walls.The corridors lead directly to living areas and communal chambers.The living areas are fur -
            nished with crude turniture and items scavenged from past vic -
            tims.

            Each jermlaine family has a personal section that half resembles a nest, half a junk yard, Treasures are concealed throughout the lair.Each family maintains a series of small, personal caches,
            while the communal hoard is hidden in a series of small chambers at the end of cunningly concealed crawl ways.No one larger than a jermlaine can reach such treasure chambers.

            Jermlaine get along well with rats of all types.They can speak all rat - related languages.They are 75 % likely to be accompanied by rats and 50 % likely to share their lair with rats.This cohabita -
            tion extends to all forms of mutual cooperation and defense.There is a 10 % chance that the jermlaine colony has a mutual co -
            operation pact with osquips rather than normal rats.

            The diet is an omnivorous mixture of insects, fresh meat, car -

            rion, fungi, and molds.Humanoids are a delicacy reserved
            for special occasions.Lizards form the bulk of the meat intake, Jerm -
            laine cherish foods from the surface, even the hardtack and iron rations carried by adventurers.If the jermlaine can identify which of the adventurers’ bags carry food, these are stolen as enthusias -
            tically as the treasure pouches.Jermlaine have a fondness
            for rari -
            ties such as sugar, candy, and preserved fruits.Such items can be used to entice the normally malevolent jermlaine to leave an ad -
            venturer alone, at least temporarily.

            Ecology: Jermlaine are opportunistic brigands who prey on un -
            wary travelers in the subterranean regions.They are well aware of any such travelers, including a party 's size, composition, and
            general condition.Jermlaine may be persuaded,
            for a suitable fee,
            to share such knowledge with adventurers.

            Jermlaine may deal with“ giants”(any race bigger than they are) if they are bribed or given access to a plentiful flow of victims or riches, They never ally themselves with truly good - aligned ad -
            venturers, although they may, in a moment of craftiness, pretend to enter such an alliance.Regardless of their spoken intentions,
            75 % of jermlaine eventually either lie to or turn against their larger“ allies.”They may make their lairs near the established territories of such races as drow, trolls, or troglodytes.Although they are careful to avoid direct conflict with such evil beings, the jermlaine happily prey on the victims of their neighbors, as well as scavenging the scenes of their neighbors’ battles.Jermlaine may act as watchmen
            for their neighbors, provided suitable terms can be agreed upon.

            They unintentionally act as garbagemen, cleaning the subterra -
            nean regions.Dead animals may be used as food or supplies,
            while dead humanoids are taken away to be searched
            for valu -
            ables or used as food.Because of this, adventurers seeking the re -
            mains of a slain companion may seek out the local jermlaines since they may be aware of where the remains are located.

                The kelpie is a form of intelligent, aquatic plant life that is able to alter its shape and cast a charm spell.Its purpose is to drown the foolish.

                Its basic form is a mass of animate seaweed.It is able to alter its form to resemble a green - clad woman, green horse, or hippocam -
                pus.Whatever the form, its substance is still green seaweed.A kelpie can communicate telepathically with those in its embrace.

                Combat: < A kelpie lacks actual offensive abilities.When a hu -
                manoid male approaches, the kelpie reshapes itself into the form of a woman or mount.Although the result is a grotesque mock -
                ery that is 95 % detectable in daylight, the kelpie can enhance its deception through magic.

                Once per day, the kelpie can cast a charm spell with a - 2 penalty to the victim’ s saving
                throw .The kelpie 's charm works only
                against humanoid males.If the victim fails the saving
                throw, he perceives the kelpie as the most desirable woman(or mount) that he can imagine.He leaps into the water, intending to hold or pos -
                sess the kelpie.The kelpie then wraps itself around the charmed man, who happily drowns as he tries to breathe water.Victims suffer 2 d10 points of damage each round until they either die, sur -
                face
                for air, or are protected from drowning.The kelpie then takes the body back to her lair, where it is consumed.Even
                if the kelpie cannot reach its victim, the spell will force the man to swim toward her and drown himself.

                If the victim is able to breathe water, he does not drown.Drowning - immune victims still happily entwine themselves within the kelpie 's embrace. Kelpies are confused by such occur-
                rences; they do not attempt to negate such protection and may ac -
                    tually welcome their victim 's continued activity.

                If the kelpie is encountered on dry land, the victim acts as its protector
                if his companions attack the kelpie.Although he is con -
                fused and enraged by his companions’ perceived treachery, he does anything he can to protect his beloved kelpie.

                Once the kelpie is slain, the charm’ s effect immediately ends.The victim is also freed
                if he survives until the charm expires.

                Due to the kelpie’ s water - drenched form, fire attacks inflict only half damage(none
                    if a saving
                    throw is made), Kelpies are in -
                visible to infravision.





                Habitat / Society: One legend tells that the kelpie was created by a vengeful sea god as a means of punishing men who were rash enough to sail the seas without giving the sea god his rightful dues, Since few women were sailors at the time, they were spared the kelpie 's curse. A less-widely told legend recounts how kelpies
                were created by Olhydra, the Elemental Princess of Evil Water Creatures.In respect to her own gender, Olhydra made all women immune to her creations’ charms.

                Kelpies are normally found in the ocean waters.Kelpies are usually found within the top 100 feet of the ocean.Kelpies are very adaptable and may make their home in any body of water,
                even artificial or subterranean ones.

                While in humanoid or equine form, they are able to walk on dry land
                for up to 1 - 3 hours.If they are encountered on land, they may still
                try to charm men.Such victims are of course safe from drowning, at least
                for the moment.They accompany, carry, and protect the kelpie.

                Kelpies reproduce asexually.They increase in size to seven feet,
                then
                break into two to four independent kelpies.Kelpies can do
                    this as often as once a month
                if victims are plentiful and they ha -
                ven 't been fed on too much by local fish. Kelpies have no defenses
                against fish, and other aquatic grazers, who perceive them as sea -
                weed to be eaten.

                Treasure is usually found in the remains of a kelpie 's victims. If
                treasure is found on a kelpie, it is most likely attached to the de -
                cayed remains still clutched within its fronds.

                Ecology: Kelpie sprouts are worth 500 gp.The sprouts are ini -
                tially too small to use magic, but they can grow in a month into full - grown kelpies
                if given ample care, Kelpies may ally them -
                selves with powerful creatures and occasionally guard submerged treasures.Kenku

                    Kenku are bipedal, humanoid birds that use their powers to an -
                    noy and inconvenience the human and demihuman races.

                    The typical kenku resembles a humanoid hawk wearing human

                    clothing.Kenku have both arms and wings.The wings are usu -
                    ally folded across the back and may be mistaken at a distance
                    for a large backpack.Height ranges from five to seven feet.The feathers are predominantly brown with white underfeathers and face markings.The eyes are a brilliant yellow.Combat: All kenku have the skills of 4 th - level thieves.They are expert fighters and usually attack with a scimitar or quarterstaft.If unarmed, they attack with either pair of claws(two attacks
                        for 1 d4 points of damage apiece) and their beak(1 d6 points of dam -
                        age).If they are on foot, they use the hand claws.If in flight, the foot claws are used.They do not usually kill unless their own
                    lives are threatened by the survival of their foe.All kenku have well - developed disguise skills.They have a 50 % chance of pass -
                    ing
                    for human, although their disguises often have telltale large noses.

                    A 3 - Hit Die kenku has one 1 st - level wizard spell, usually magic missile.Once each 30 days a kenku can shape change and retain that shape
                    for up to seven days.A 4 - Hit Die kenku has an extra Ist - level spell, often shocking grasp.They gain the innate ability to become invisible with no limitation on duration or frequency of use.A 5 - Hit Dice kenku leader gains an additional 2 nd - level mage spell, usually mirror image or web, and the innate ability to call lightning(the same as the 3 rd - level priest spell).

                    Habitat Society: Kenku area secretive race that lives among the human and demihuman races without the bulk of the population ever being aware of their presence.

                    If a group of kenku is encountered, the group 's size determines
                    its composition.A group of five or fewer contains two 2 - Hit Dice and three 3 - Hit Dice kenku.A group of six or seven has a leader with 4 Hit Dice, three kenku with 3 Hit Dice, and the rest have 2 Hit Dice.A group of eight kenku adds a supreme leader of 5 Hit Dice.

                    Kenku do not speak;
                    although they may give out bird - like



                    squawks, these are gibberish.Kenku apparently communicate with each other telepathically.They are adept at symbols, sign language, and pantomime.

                    Kenku may appear to be friendly, helpful, and even generous.They freely give treasure to humans and demihumans, but it is rarely genuine and crumbles into dust within a day.They may of -
                    fer nonverbal advice to humanoids, but this is carefully designed to mislead.It may actually lead the party into dangers and diffi -
                    culties they might otherwise have avoided.As a rule of thumb,
                    kenku have only a 5 % chance of actually helping people.

                    The actual structure of kenku society is elusive.The kenku themselves either refuse to comment or lie.Those kenku lairs that have been encountered tend to be small underground chambers or cave complexes.It is believed that large caverns deep under -
                    ground may hold sizeable kenku communities, including individ -
                    uals of 6 Hit Dice or more and with greater magical powers.

                    Kenku reproduction is similar to that of large birds.The female lays a clutch of two to four eggs that hatch after 60 days.New hatchlings are featherless, helpless, and have 1 hit point each.Hatchlings grow swiftly and gain 1 hit point each month.Within six to eight months they have adult feathers and are able to func -
                    tion independently as 1 - Hit Die kenku.At this point they can be -
                    gin to learn to use the skills they need as adults(thieving, fighting,
                        disguise).If a hatchling is captured, it either lacks this training or has whatever minimal skills it acquired before capture.

                    Younger kenku(3 Hit Dice or less) are reckless and prone to au -

                    dacious plans.They have been known to pass themselves off as gods and collect the worshipers 's offerings. Older kenku are more
                    reserved and cunning, preferring to kidnap wealthy humans and demihumans as a source of revenue.Ecology: Domestically raised kenku are prized as servants.Kenku eggs are commonly sold
                    for 250 gp, hatchlings
                    for 300 - 500 gp.However, this is a form of slave trade, with all the attendant complications.If a kenku discovers captive kenku, it will attempt to secretly rescue the captive and,
                    if possible, kidnap the slave trader or owner.They will avenge slain kenku.

                            The ki - rin’ s coat is covered with luminous golden scales like a sunrise on a clear morning.The thick mane and tail are a darker gold.The horn and hooves are gold tinged with pink, The eyes are a deep violet.The ki - rin has a melodious voice,

                            Ki - rin speak their own language.Since they are telepathic, they are able to mentally or verbally converse with virtually any living thing.

                            for 2 d12 people, as well as 32 cubic feet of soft goods or 18 cubic feet of wooden items.These are permanent creations.The ki - rin can create metal items with a total weight of up to 2, 000 gp weight, but such items have very short life spans.In general, the harder the substance,
                            the shorter the life span;
                            for example, adamantite lasts an hour,
                            while gold lasts 1 d4 + 1 days.

                        Combat: Killmoulis are basically inoffensive beings.They lack any real ability or inclination to attack humans or demihumans.They may use needles to stab rats; such attacks cause 1 point of damage.

                        Killmoulis hate dogs, cats, and rats, as these animals attack killmoulis.Rats are snared and stabbed with long needles.Cats and dogs are poisoned
                        if the animals prove a threat to the killmoulis.If the killmoulis are unable to deal with the dangers of an area, they pack up and leave

                        Killmoulis keep small amounts of treasure.These are usually items they have found or scavenged along the way.Although they may steal from hostile“ giants, ”they are happy to share their meager wealth with their friends.

                        Ecology: Killmoulis are a race that has adapted to a symbiotic lifestyle.Wise humans and demihumans welcome these secretive assistants; despite the killmoulis’ appetites, their work tends to be more valuable than the food they consume.Killmoulis also act as guardians and watchmen against mutual threats, such as vermin and fire.

                        Kuo - toa are an ancient race of fish - men that dwells underground and harbors a deep hatred of surface dwellers and sunlight.

                        A kuo - toan presents a cold and horrible appearance.A typical specimen looks much like a human body, albeit a paunchy one,
                        covered in scales and topped with a fish 's head. The huge fish eyes
                        tend to swivel in different directions when observing an area or creature.The hands and feet are very long, with three fingers and an opposing digit, partially webbed, The legs and arms are short
                        for the body size.Its coloration is pale grey, with undertones of tan or yellow in males only.The skin has a sheen from its slimy covering.The color darkens when the kuo - toan is angry and pales when it is badly frightened.A strong odor of dead fish fol -
                        lows it around.

                        It wears no clothing, only leather harnesses
                        for its weapons and gear, Typically, a kuo - toan warrior carries daggers, spears,
                        shields, harpoons and weighted throwing nets.

                        Kuo - toa speak the strange subterranean trade language com -
                        mon to most intelligent underworld dwellers.Additionally, they speak their own arcane tongue and have empathic contact with most fish.Their religious speech is a corruption of the language used on the elemental plane of Water;
                        if a kuo - toan priest is in a group of kuo - toa, it is 75 % unlikely that a creature native to the plane of Water will attack,
                        for the priest will request mercy in the name of the Sea Mother, Blibdoolpoolp.

                        Combat: These creatures normally travel in well - armed bands.If more than 20 kuo - toa are encountered, it is 50 % likely that they are within 1 d6 miles of their lair.For every four normal warriors encountered there is an additional fighter of 3 rd or 4 th level.For every eight normal fighters there is an additional fighter of 5 th or 6 th level.For every 12 normal kuo - toa in the group there is a cleric / thief of 1 d4 + 3 levels each.If more than 20 normal fighters are encountered, the group is a war consisting of the following:

                        One 10 th - level fighter as Captain

                        Two 8 th - level fighters as Lieutenants Four 3 rd / 3 rd - level fighter / thief Whips One Monitor(see below)

                        One slave per four kuo - toa





                        The whips are fanatical devotees of the Sea Mother goddess of the kuo - toa, They inspire the troops to stand firm and fight without quarter
                        for the glory of their ruler and their deity.

                        It is 50 % probable that any kuo - toan priest above 6 th level is armed with a pincer staff.This is a five - foot - long pole topped by a three - foot - long claw.If the user scores a hit, the claw has closed upon the opponent, making escape impossible.The weapon can be used only on enemies with a girth range between an elf and a gnoll.It is 10 % probable that both arms are pinned by the claw and 40 % probable that one arm is trapped.If the victim is right handed, the claw traps the left hand 75 % of the time.Trapped op -
                        ponents lose shield and Dexterity bonuses.If the weapon arm is trapped, the victim cannot attack and the Dexterity bonus is lost,
                        but the shield bonus remains.

                        The harpoon is mostly used only by higher level fighters, It is a wickedly barbed throwing weapon with a 30 yard range, It in -
                        flicts 2 d6 points of damage, exclusive of bonuses.Victims must roll a successful saving
                        throw of 13 + on 1 d20 to avoid being
                        snagged by the weapon.Man - sized or smaller beings who fail this saving
                        throw are jerked off their feet and stunned
                        for 1 d4 rounds.The kuo - toan, who is attached to his weapon by a stout cord,
                        then tries to haul in its victim and slay him with a dagger thrust.

                        Kuo - toan shields are made of special boiled leather and are treated with a unique glue - like substance before a battle.Anyone who attacks a kuo - toan from the front has a 25 % chance of get -
                        ting his weapon stuck fast.The chance of the victim freeing the weapon is the same as his chance
                        for opening doors.

                        Hit probability
                        for kuo - toa is the same as that of a human of similar level, but males also gain a + 1 bonus to both attack rolls and damage rolls when using a weapon, due to Strength.When fighting with a dagger only, kuo - toa can bite, which causes 1 d4 + 1 points of damage.

                        When two or more kuo - toan priests or priest / thieves operate together, they can generate a lightning stroke by joining hands.The bolt is two feet wide and hits only one target unless by mis -

                        per caster per round,

                        The special defenses of these creatures include skin secretions, 

                        Kuo - Toa

                        which gives attempts to grapple, grasp, tie, or web a kuo - toan only a 25 % chance of success.Despite their eyes being set on the sides of their heads, they have excellent independent monocular vision, with a 180 - degree field of vision and the ability to spot movement even though the subject is invisible, astral, or ethereal.Thus, by maintaining complete motionlessness, a subject can avoid detection.Kuo - toa also have 60 - foot infravision and have the ability to sense vibrations up to 10 yards away.They are sur -
                        prised only on a 1 on the 1 d10 surprise roll.

                        Kuo - toa are totally immune to poison and are not affected by paralysis.Spells that generally affect only humanoid types have no effect on them.Electrical attacks cause half damage, or none
                        if the saving
                        throw is successful; magic missiles cause only 1 point of damage; illusions are useless against them.However, kuo - toa hate bright light and suffer a - 1 penalty to their attack roll in such circumstances as daylight or light spells.They suffer full damage from fire attacks and save with a - 2 penalty against them.

                        Sometimes kuo - toa are encountered in small bands journeying in the upper world to kidnap humans
                        for slaves and sacrifices.Such parties are sometimes also found in dungeon labyrinths that connect to the extensive system of underworld passages and ca -
                        verns that honeycomb the crust of the earth.Only far below the surface of the earth can the intrepid explorer find the caverns in
                        which the kuo - toa build their underground communities.

                        Habitat / Society: Kuo - toa spawn as do fish, and hatchlings, or
                        fingerlings as they call their young, are raised in pools until their amphibian qualities develop, about one year after hatching.The young, now a foot or so high, are then able to breathe air and they are raised in pens according to their sex and fitness.There are no families, as we know them, in kuo - toan society.

                        Especially fit fingerlings, usually of noble spawning, are trained
                        for the priesthood as priests, priest / thieves, or special cel -

                        sane, The monitor is capable of attacking to subdue or kill.A monitor has 56 hit points, attacks as a 7 th - level fighter and has the following additional abilities: twice the normal movement rate, AC 1, and receives four attacks per round— two barehanded
                        for 2 d4 points of damage(double
                            if trying to subdue) and two at -
                        tacks with teeth
                        for 1 d4 + 1 points of damage.One hand / bite at -
                        tack occurs according to the initiative roll, the other occurs at the end of the round.

                        Subdued creatures cannot be larger than eight feet tall and 500 pounds.Subduing attacks cause only half real damage, but when the points of damage inflicted equal the victim 's total, the crea-
                        ture is rendered unconscious
                        for 3 d4 rounds.

                        Kuo - toan communities do not generally cooperate, though
                        they have special places of worship in common.These places are usually
                        for intergroup trade, councils, and worship of the Sea Mother, so they are open to all kuo - toa.These religious com -
                        munities, as well as other settlements, are open to drow and their servants,
                        for the dark elves provide useful goods and services,
                        though the drow are both feared and hated by the kuo - toa.This leads to many minor skirmishes and frequent kidnappings be -
                        tween the peoples.The illithids(mind flayers) are greatly hated by the kuo - toa and they and their allies are attacked on sight.

                        The ancient kuo - toa once inhabited the shores and islands of the upper world, but as the race of mankind grew more numerous and powerful, these men - fish were slowly driven to remote re -
                        gions.Continual warfare upon these evil, human - sacrificing creatures threatened to exterminate the species,
                        for a number of powerful beings were aiding mankind, their sworn enemies.Some kuo - toa sought refuge in sea caverns and secret subterra -
                        nean waters, and
                        while their fellows were being slaughtered,

                        these few prospered and developed new powers to adapt to their lightless habitat.The seas contained other fierce and evil crea -
                        tures, however, and the deep - dwelling kuo - toa were eventually wiped out, leaving only those in the underworld to carry on, un -
                        noticed and eventually forgotten by mankind.But the remaining kuo - toa have not forgotten mankind, and woe to any who fall into their slimy clutches.

                        Now the kuo - toa are haters of sunlight and are almost never encountered on the earth 's surface. This, and their inborn hatred
                        of discipline, prevent the resurgence of these creatures,
                        for they have become numerous once again and acquired new powers.However, they have also become somewhat unstable, possibly as a result of inbreeding, and insanity is common among the species.

                        If a kuo - toan lair is found, it contains 4 d10 x 10 2 nd - level males.In addition, there are higher level fighters in the same ratio as noted
                        for wandering groups.The leader of the group is one of the following, depending on the lair 's population:

                        There are also the following additional kuo - toa in the lair:

                        Eight Eyes of the priest leader— 6 th - to 8 th - level priest / thieves One Chief Whip— éth / éth - level fighter / thief

                        Young(noncombatant) equal to 20 % of the total kuo - toa Slaves equal to 50 % of the total male population

                        In special religious areas there are also a number of kuo - toan priests.For every 20 kuo - toa in the community there is a 3 rd - level priest,
                        for every 40 there is a 4 th - level priest,
                        for every 80 there is a Sth - level priest, all in addition to the others.These priests are headed by one of the following groups:

                        One 6 th - level priest
                        if the group is 160 or fewer, or One 7 th - level and one 6 th - level priest
                        if the group is between 161 and 240,
                        or

                        One 8 th - level, one 7 th - level, and one 6 th - level priest
                        if the group numbers between 241 and 320, or

                        One 9 th - level, two 7 th - level, and three oth - level priests
                        if the group numbers between 321 and 400, or

                        One 10 th - level, two 8 th - level, and four 6 th - level priests
                        if the group numbers over 400

                        Though kuo - toa prefer a diet of flesh, they also raise fields of kelp and fungi to supplement their food supply, These fields, lit by strange phosphorescent fungi, are tended by slaves, who are also used
                        for food and sacrifices.

                        Kuo - toan treasures tend more toward pearls, gem - encrusted items of a water motif, and mineral ores mined by their slaves.Any magical items in the possession of a kuo - toan are usually ob -
                        tained from adventuring parties that never made it home again.

                        Ecology: Not much is known to surtace - dwelling sages about this enigmatic, violent, subterranean race, but some of the more astute scholars speculate that the kuo - toa are but one - third of the three - way rivalry that includes mind flayers and drow.It is parti -
                        ally because of this continuing warfare that none of the three races has been able to achieve dominance of the surface world.

                        Of all the hazards that the desert presents, few can compare with the cruel race of flesh - eating creatures known as lamias.These half - human, half - quadruped beast hybrids use deceit, speed, and spells to entrap the foolhardy adventurer who dares wander into their ruins.

                        Their upper torsos, arms, and heads resemble those of beauti -
                        ful human women,
                        while their lower bodies are those of beasts,
                        such as goats, deer, or lions, with the appropriate coloration.This hybrid configuration makes lamias very fast and powerful.They are usually armed with daggers, which they use to carve up their prey
                        for the feast.Lamias sometimes smell like perfume flowers, so as to attract unwary victims.They wear no clothing or jewelry.ln communicating, they use the common tongue.

                        Combat: A lamia is able to use the following spells once per day: charm person, mirror image, suggestion, and illusion(as a wand), For purposes of duration, effect, etc.assume that the Ja -

                        for the creature to devour at its leisure.

                        The lamia’ s touch permanently drains 1 point of Wisdom from a victim, and when his Wisdom drops below 3, he willingly does whatever the lamia tells him do .These orders often involve hav -

                        while it continues whittling down their ranks.If it has a chance to drain the Wisdom of more than one victim, it will certainly do so.It may even use its charm
                        spell to supplement its control over party members.

                        Among a lamia’ s favorite illusions to cast upon itself are the fol -
                        lowing: a lovely damsel in distress, a tough but beautiful female ranger, or an elf maiden, At times, it simply may cast an illusion of a lost child in distress or a group of peasants being attacked by a large beast,

                        tack from the rear.

                        Habitat / Society: Lamias dwell in ruined cities or caves, places situated in desert or wasteland areas.These evil creatures are soli:
                        tary beasts, sustaining themselves on the flesh of those who walk too close to their territories.During lean times, they supplement their diet by stalking game animals, Lamias hardly ever venture more than ten miles from their lairs.











                        Ecology: Lamias are legendary monsters that prey upon trav -

                        These beings rule over the lamias and the wild, lonely areas they inhabit.They differ from the normal lamias in that the lamia no -
                        bles’ lower bodies are those of giant serpents and their upper bodies can be either male or female.It is rumored that the normal female lamia is born from the union of two nobles.

                        The males wield short swords and have 1 dé6 levels of wizard spells, plus the inherent spells charm person, mirror image, sug -
                        gestion, and illusion, The females are unarmed and only attack with magic; they are more experienced magically and have 2 d4 levels of wizard spells plus the usual inherent spells.

                        Like normal Jamia, lamia nobles have the Wisdom - draining touch.

                        All Jamia nobles are able to assume human form, In this guise they attempt to penetrate human society and wreak evil.They speak all of the languages of humans and demihumans.When in

                        The lammasu, a winged leonine figure with a human head, aids and protects lawful good persons.They are generally kind and friendly to all good creatures.

                        Lammasu resemble golden - brown lions with the wings of ea -
                        gles and the heads of men with shaggy hair and beards.Their
                        for -
                        midable appearance is softened by their regal, compassionate,
                        and beneficent expressions.They communicate in their own tongue, in common, and through a limited form of telepathy.

                        Combat: Since lammasu are concerned
                        for the welfare and safety of good beings, they almost always enter combat
                        if they see good creatures being threatened, in the way least likely to cause harm to the good beings.

                        Lammasu are able to become invisible or dimension door at will.They radiate a protection from evil, 10 ' radius (-2 penalty to
                        all evil attacks, +2 bonus to saving throws against evil attacks).Additionally, they are able to use priest spells up to 4 th level, at 7 th - level proficiency.Lammasu can employ four Ist - level spells,
                    three 2 nd - level spells, two 3 rd - level spells, and one 4 th - level spell.They have cure wounds of double effect(4 d8 + 2 and 6 d8 + 6), and 10 % of lammasu can speak a holy word as well.

                    If all
                    else fails, Jammasu can attack with their two razor - sharp
                    front claws, inflicting 1 d6é points of damage each.If they choose to swoop down from the sky on a target, this damage is doubled.

                    Habitat / Society: The lammasu have a very structured and law -
                    ful society, reflecting their alignment.They are organized in
                    prides, just like lions.They dwell in old, abandoned temples situ -
                    ated in warm regions.These temples have not lost their consecra -
                    tion, and in some way, the lammasu are the self - appointed resident guardians of these high and holy places.As a rule, only one pride of lammasu is ever found in a 25 - mile area; they spread themselves out so they can respond quickly to any evil outburst.

                    Lammasu females fight as effectively as the males;
                    for every four lammasu encountered, one is a female.When found in their lair, there are young equal to 25 % of the adult population, Fe -
                    male jammasu have the heads of women, with long, hair.

                    Once a month, the pride leaders gather together to consort about how the war on evil goes.This grouping is called the Whi -
                    temoon, since it takes place on the first night of the full moon.











                    There are usually 6 d6 lammasu and 2 d4 greater lammasu, with the latter presiding over the meeting.Such a gathering of lawful good causes the entire temple where they meet to glow in a pure light, until it breaks up at dawn.There is perhaps no safer place in
                    all the world that night.

                    Though they dwell in warm areas, they occasionally visit every clime.They speak their own tongue as well as common.At times they use a limited form of telepathy.

                    Good - aligned strangers are always well received.Neutrals are watched carefully, but are treated politely unless the outsiders be -
                    gin causing trouble, Evil beings are firmly asked to leave, and
                    if they fail to do so, they are attacked by the pride.In
                    case of trou -
                    ble, there is a cumulative 10 % chance per turn that a neighboring pride picks up a telepathic summons and come to help out the original pride, Lammasu harbor an especially strong dislike
                    for lamias and manticores.Some foolish people confuse lammasu
                    for manticores, which does little to improve the lammasu disposition toward them.

                    Ecology:
                        Lammasu keep the wastelands from being completely overrun by evil creatures.Their aid to frontier settlements is be -
                        yond measurable value.

                        Greater Lammasu

                        These creatures are slightly larger than a lesser lammasu and one or two may be found dwelling with a pride of six or more lesser lammasu.Greater lammasu can travel the Astral and Ethereal Planes, become invisible, teleport without error and dimension door, all at will.They radiate protection from evil in a 20 ' radius
                        (-4 penalty to evil attacks and + 4 bonus to saving throws) and have the curative powers of their lesser cousins.Their priest spells consist of five 1 st - level, four 2 nd - level, three 3 rd - level, two 4 th -
                        level, and one 5 th - level spell.Fifty percent of greater lammasu can speak a holy word as well.They cast spells as 12 th - level priests.

                        Greater lammasu have empathy, telepathic communication,
                        and speak their racial speech and the common tongue.Despite their greater stature, these lammasu are just as gentle and humble as their lesser brethren.Lamprey

    Lampreys are leech - like eels that dwell in deep fresh and salt wa -
    ter.They feed by biting their victims, fastening on with their teeth, and draining blood from their prey.

    These disgusting creatures are characterized by their sphincter -
    like mouths ringed with sharp teeth, The average lamprey has a sickly brown - green - grayish coloring, with the salt water dwellers having a greater amount of gray.

    Combat: They feed by biting their victims, fastening themselves by their sphincter - like mouths.Once attached and the initial damage is inflicted upon the victim, the lamprey begins to drain blood on the next and successive rounds.The rate of blood drain is equivalent to 2 hit points per Hit Die of the lamprey.Thus, a norma!lamprey drains blood
    for 2 points of damage per round.

    Sea lampreys are especially susceptible to fire, making their saving throws against fire - based attacks with a - 2 penalty.Of



    course, any fire - based spell aimed at a lamprey attached to a vic -
    tim means that he, too, must make a saving
    throw !

        Once a lamprey attaches itself to a victim, the only way to re -
        move it is by killing it.As a rule of thumb, a lamprey sucks blood
    equivalent to its hit points, then detaches itself.The victim of a gi -
    ant lamprey, however, continues to bleed at a rate of 2 hit points worth of blood loss per round until the wound is bandaged.

    Habitat / Society;Lampreys inhabit deep water areas and dwell in natural caves or coral formations.Lampreys have an unerring homing instinct that enables them to range up to two miles away from its lair.

    A lamprey lair is notoriously devoid of treasure since they do
        not take their victims back to these places, preferring to suck the
    blood immediately upon encountering their prey.

    Lampreys live to eat and reproduce.They are savage, nasty -
    tempered creatures.They are territorial and vigorously defend their lairs.Usually, 4 d6 lamprey eggs can be found in a lair,

    Ecology: In salt water environs, sharks enjoy feeding on giant lampreys.It could be argued that the presence of these sea lam -
    preys keeps down the number of shark attacks on coastal com -
    munities.

    Land Lamprey

    A land lamprey is only about three feet long but fairly thick and heavy.Coloration ranges from light green to blackish green.This color scheme enables the land lamprey to hide in greenery such as bushes or tall grass with a 75 % chance of success.

    Land lampreys are mutated versions of sea lampreys.They breathe air and move in a snake - like fashion.Land lampreys may be found in almost any climate except desert or extreme cold.They prefer dark and damp environments;like their aquatic counterparts, they favor small caves
    for lairs.

    Land lampreys feed as do aquatic ones.Once attached(a hit
        for 1 point of damage), a land Jamprey drains blood
    for three consecutive rounds, unless killed or removed,
    for 1 point of damage per round.

    In addition,
    while attached to a character, each lamprey en -
    cumbers an individual;this is equivalent to a loss of 1 point of Dexterity per lamprey attached.Land lampreys can be removed only by killing them or exposing them to fire, whereupon they re -
    lease their hold in an effort to avoid the flames.

        Giant leeches are horrid, slug - like creatures that dwell in wet,
        slimy areas and suck the blood of warm - blooded creatures.These disgusting parasites range from two to five feet long.Their slimy skin is mottled brown and tan with an occasional shade of gray.Two antennae protrude from atop the head.

        Combat: Leeches wait in the mud and slime
        for prey.The initial attack attaches the sucker mouth of the giant leech, On the next round, and on each round thereafter, it drains blood
        for 1 point of damage per Hit Die of the leech.There is only a 1 % chance that the victim is aware of the attack
        if it occurs in the water.The leech has anesthetizing saliva, and its bite and blood drain are not usu -

        bodies.There is a 50 % chance that the bite of one of these crea -
        tures causes a disease that is fatal in 1 d4 + 1 weeks unless cured.

        Habitat / Society: These creatures are found only in the waters of swamps and marshes.Giant leeches range from 1 to 4 Hit Dice in
        size; various sized creatures usually are found in a group.

        Throat Leech

        This leech is about one inch long and resembles an inconspicuous twig.It is found in pools, lakes, and streams.

        Anyone drinking water containing a leech has a 10 % chance of taking it into his mouth unless the water is carefully filtered(such as through a sheet of gauze) before drinking.The leech sucks blood at the rate of 1 - 3 points of damage per round, until it be -
        comes completely distended.After ten rounds of sucking, the leech is bloated and will not suck any more blood.

        Each round that the leech is in the victim 's throat, there is a
        50 % chance that the victim chokes, causing an additional 1 d4 points of damage.A victim who chokes on three successive rounds dies on the third round,

        Apart from magical means that may suggest themselves, the only way to kill a throat leech in a victim 's throat is to place a
        thin, heated metal object, such as a wire, into the bloated leech; the hot metal causes the leech to burst and no further damage is inflicted on the victim.

        Leech swarm

        This is merely a massive swarm of small leeches, found only in the water.They move in a cloud ten feet in diameter.Anyone caught in the swarm receives 1 d10 points of damage per round from blood drain.Area - effect attacks that inflict 10 or more points of damage will disperse the swarm.

            Leprechauns are diminutive folk who are tound in fair, green lands and enjoy frolicking, working magic, and causing harmless mischiet.

            Rumored to be a cross between a species of halfling and a strong strain of pixie, leprechauns are about two feet tall.They have pointed ears, and their noses also come to a tapered point.About 30 % of all male leprechauns have beards.Pointed shoes,
            brown or green breeches, green or gray coats, and either wide -
            brimmed or stocking caps are the preferred dress of the wee folk Many leprechauns also enjoy smoking a pipe, usually a long -
            stemmed one.

            Combat; These fun - loving creatures of magical talent are by na -
            ture noncombative.They can become invisible at will, poly -
            morph nonliving objects, create illusions(with full audio and olfactory effects), and use ventriloquism spells as often as they like.Their keen ears prevent them from ever being surprised.Be -
            ing full of mischief, they often(75 % ) snatch valuable objects from adventurers, turn invisible and dash away.There is a 75 %
            chance that the attempt is successful.If pursued closely, there is a 25 % chance per turn of pursuit that the leprechaun drops the stolen goods.The chase never leads to the leprechaun’ s lair.

            If caught or discovered in its lair(10 % chance), the leprechaun attempts to mislead his captor into believing that he is giving over his treasure
            while he actually is duping the captor.It requires great care to actually obtain the leprechaun’ s treasure.Habitat / Society: Leprechauns live in families of up to 20,
            though they call this unit a clan.They use first names and sur -
            names, and it is fairly certain that these names are a good indica -
            tor of which clan one is dealing with.A lair usually consists of a warm, dry cave with a hearth, rugs, and furniture.Strangely,
            word travels fast between clans of the same surname, and a clan that a group of adventurers runs into may already know the ad -
            venturers names from another clan the party encountered several days prior.

            There is a rumor that a King of the Leprechauns exists, but there seems to be no official political hierarchy.There are no com -
            munities or villages of leprechauns.

            It is rare to see leprechaun offspring, but they do exist, born











            with the full magical powers of an adult.For every 10 adults en -
            countered in a lair, one child will be found.

            Leprechauns enjoy eating the same sorts of foods that humans and demihumans eat, with a special fondness
            for wine.This weakness may be used to outwit them.

            Gold is the one treasure found in every leprechaun’ s hoard, If an intruder secures this treasure, a leprechaun will bargain and beg to get it back, As a last desperate measure, he will grant the intruder three wishes(very limited), but only
            if the intruder gives over the treasure first.When this is done, the leprechaun will in -
            deed grant the three wishes.After all three wishes, the leprechaun will flatter the intruder and declare that the three wishes were so well - phrased that he will give a fourth wish.If the fourth wish is pronounced, the leprechaun will cackle with glee, the results of all the wishes will be reversed, and the intruder plus his group will be teleported(no saving
                throw) to a random location 2 d20 miles away.No member of that party will never be able to find that par -
            ticular leprechaun again.

            Leprechauns are naturally distrustful toward humans and dwarves, since these races have greedy tendencies.They get along well with elves, gnomes.and halflings.

            A leprechaun will not sit idly by
            while a helpless creature is at -
            tacked, since they have a soft spot
            for weaker creatures.In gen -
            eral,
            if a leprechaun senses that a stranger means no harm, he can be quite civil, but he will not bring visitors to his lair.If the lepre -
            chaun finds someone hurt, he might take the victim to his lair, but only after making sure that the stranger is not followed and can -
            not see where he is being taken,

            Ecology: The best times and places to observe leprechauns are called borderlines.Dawn and dusk(which are neither all light nor dark), the shore(which is neither all earth nor all water), or the equinoxes and solstices(which are neither one season nor an -
                other), are the best times and places to see leprechauns and their ilk frolicking and celebrating.

            The leucrotta is a creature of ugly appearance and temperament that haunts deserted places in search of prey.

            The average leucrotta stands seven feet tall at the shoulder and can reach a length of nine feet in its mature form.The body of the leucrotta resembles that of a stag, with a leonine tufted tail and cloven hooves.Its head resembles that of a huge badger, but in -
            stead of teeth it has sharp, jagged bony ridges.Its body is tan,
            with the neck gradually darkening until it turns black at the head.The so - called teeth are sickly gray, and its eyes glow with a feral red light.The smell of decomposing animals on a hot humid day follows the leucrotta, and its breath is especially bad.

            Combat: This monster is very sly and can imitate a range of noises and voices, the most common ones being a man, a woman,
            a child, or domestic animals in pain.It uses these noises in order to trick its prey into approaching within attack distance.It hunts humans, demihumans, humanoids, and even other animal preda -
            tors.Leucrotta are intelligent and can speak their own language as well as the common tongue.

            Leucrotta attack by biting
            for 3 d6 points of damage.It is ru -
            mored that their bony ridges and jaws are so powerful that they can even bite through metal.If a leucrotta scores a hit against someone with a shield or armor, the target must roll a saving
            throw vs.crushing blow
            for the shield.If the roll fails, then in ad -
            dition to scoring the regular damage, the beast managed to also bite through the shield.Once the shield is gone, the armor must go through the same routine with subsequent successful bites.

            Once an opponent is rendered helpless, a leucrotta will leave its prize and attack any other intruders
            if the melee is still going on.It will give chase to an enemy, but will never pursue beyond sight of any prey it has managed to already capture.

            When a leucrotta retreats, it turns its back on its opponent and kicks with its hind legs, causing 1 d6 points of damage with each hoof,

            Note to trackers: It is almost impossible to identify leucrotta tracks, since they look exactly like a stag’ s.

            Habitat / Society: This ugly creature haunts deserted and deso -
            late places because most other creatures cannot bear the sight of it.Its ugliness is legendary.Leucrotta lair in treacherous ravines











            and rocky spires, because they are as surefooted as a mountain goat, Caves, old abandoned towers, or a hollowed out deadfall are the preferred lairs
            for this disgusting beast.

            For every four leucrotta found in a lair, there is a 10 % chance that an extra one, an immature leucrotta of half strength, is also present.Leucrotta are not a very family oriented species, as their nasty tempers extend sometimes to each other.The beasts range over a 20 - mile area.

            Since the leucrotta is not a very social creature, all strangers are nothing more than sources of food, Sometimes, a powerful cha -
            otic evil person may entrap a leucrotta and force it to serve as a guardian, but such beasts rebel at the first opportunity.

            Those brave enough to venture into a leucrotta lair must first roll a successful saving
            throw vs.poison with a - 1 penalty, due to
            the horrendous stench, or gag helplessly
            for 1 d4 rounds.Once in -
            side, the money and possessions of past victims await.

            Though the leucrotta prefer freshly killed meat, they are not above eating carrion.This serves to enhance their already bad reputation.

            Ecology: Leucrotta distance themselves from the grand picture of nature, preferring to lurk on the fringes.They serve no practi -
            cal use and one would be hard pressed to find a druid that would
            try to protect a member of this species.Some sages speculate that the leucrotta is an unnatural abnormality, an aberration spawned by some demented power or archmage.

            Still, some mages prize the leucrotta hide
            for creating boots of striding and springing, hoping that the surefootedness of the beast passes down to the boots themselves.There are rumors that leucrotta saliva is an effective antidote to love philters, but so far there have been no volunteers to test this theory out.

            XP VALUE:



            The locathah are a humanoid race of aquatic nomads that roams warm coastal waters.

            A typical locathah stands five to six feet tall and weighs 150 to 200 pounds.The skin is covered in fine but tough scales.The scales vary in color from a ivory yellow on the stomach and neck to a pale yellow on the rest of the body.The fins of their ears and spine are ocher.The ear fins enhance hearing
            while the large eyes are designed to enhance underwater vision.The only way to dis -
            tinguish males from females is a vertical ocher stripe marking the egg sac.On the surface, locathah have a typically fish - like smell.They speak their own language; 10 % also speak merman,
            koalinth, or other aquatic languages.

            Combat: The highly intelligent locathah have developed tactics

            that enable them to beat their deadlier rivals.They always oper -

            ate in teams, the larger the better.Furthermore, when away from

            their homes they ride giant eels that act as both mounts and allies.A typical locathah force is armed as follows;

            Lance 20 %
            Crossbow 30 %
            Trident 30 %
            Short sword 20 %

            Since a locathah lacks claws or teeth, it cannot do damage
            if it is disarmed.If that happens, it will either grapple a foe(
                if armed lo -
                cathah are present), look
            for weapons, or flee.Locathah only bat -
            tle to the death
            if cornered or
            if their home is threatened.

            Habitat / Society: Locathah have developed a society similar to that of surface humans.They have a well - developed hunter -
            gatherer society and a strong sense of territory.Locathah make their lairs in rocks carved into castle - like strongholds.These aquatic castles are very similar to their surface counterparts.Openings are protected by stout doors, shutters, or coral bars.Often 4 d4 moray eels are used as guardbeasts.There is a 50 %
            chance that Portuguese man - o - war jellyfish may be used as traps.A herd of giant eels is kept at the edge of each stronghold.Locathah have a communal society organized in tribes of 20 to several hundred.Each band of 40 locathah has a leader(18 hit points, treat as a 4 th - level fighter) and four assistants(14 hit











                points, treat as 3 rd - level fighters).Clans of more than 120 loca -
            thah are led by a female chieftain(22 hit points, treat as a 5 th -
                level fighter) accompanied by 12 guards(12 - 14 hit points, treat as 3 rd - level fighters).

            Clan chieftains are prolific egg layers, Eggs are gathered into well - guarded nurseries where they hatch after five to six months.Hatchlings are raised communally but each is assigned a“ parent”,
            a nonwarrior adult that takes personal responsibility
            for that hatchling.

            Locathah shamans are priests of up to 3 rd level.

            Ecology: Locathah are omnivorous.They have both aquatic farmers and hunter - gatherers that provide a varied diet
            for their clan brethren, The locathah’ 's stone-age technology is limited to
            manufacturing weapons, tools, and ornaments from available materials.More advanced or magical items are scavenged from sunken wrecks, invaders, and drowning victims.Although they detend their territories against hostile invaders, locathah cooper -
            ate with nonhostile visitors, especially traders.Locathan coral carvings and jewelry are highly valued by art collectors and are traded
            for forged metals, ceramics, and durable magical items.Locathah can be hired to assist travelers in their realm.They also collect tolls from fishermen using locathah territorial waters.

            Locathah never voluntarily leave the water.They are almost helpless on land.They are limited to slow crawls because they are unused to supporting their own weight.The use of magic to fly or levitate will negate this helplessness, They risk swift suffocation as their gills dry out; after 10 turns, a surfaced locathah suffers 1 point of damage each round.If the locathah immerses itself in wa -
            ter, the damage is halted.

            Locathah always
            try to recover captive locathah or their bodies.If such are detected aboard a ship, other locathah might first demand the
            return of their kin or simply sink the boat by
            carving into its bottom.Lurker Above

                ing, where it is very difficult to detect(only 10 % chance) unless actually prodded.

                Combat: Lurkers are slow - moving creatures that must wait
                for their prey to come into range.Lurkers wait on the ceiling, then drop and wrap themselves around their prey.Lurkers cause a - 4 penalty to opponents’ surprise rolls, The constriction causes 1 d6 points of damage per round and suffocation within 1 d4 + 1 rounds, regardless of the damage suffered by the victim.This damage is automatic each round unless the victim breaks tree or the lurker dies.Lurkers do not stop attacking until dead.Prey can
                only fight with short weapons that were in hand when the lurker attacked.

                Habitat / Society: Lurkers are solitary creatures.The females lays eggs in a glutinous clutch near the ceiling.The hatchlings fall to the ground and feed on vermin until they become large enough to fly, Young resemble rectangular patches of moss.

                Ecology: Lurkers are opportunistic feeders that make do with
                whatever wanders by.The lurker flies by means of gases gener -
                ated into sacs, These gases may be used in the preparation of a po -
                tion of levitation.Lurker eggs or hatchlings may be sold as living defenses
                for those who want them.Lurker, trapper, and miner eggs can all be sold
                for 900 gp, hatchlings tor 1, 100 gp.

                Trapper

                The subterranean trapper is found only in caves and other dark places.It can alter its shape and color to resemble the local floor and to form a protuberance in the center that resembles a box.A trapper is difficult to detect(95 % ) once it has settled into a dis -
                guise.When prey wanders into the trapper 's center, the creature'
                s edges rise up and wrap around the victim, The victim suffers damage per round equal to 4 points plus his Armor Class(a vic -
                    tim with AC 2 suffers 6 points of damage per round).The con -
                striction prevents breathing; victims smother in six rounds

                regardless of the damage suffered.A trapper does not release a victim unless the trapper is reduced to hit point or killed.

                Trappers are immune to heat - or cold - based attacks, Trappers remain wrapped in a ball tor 1 d8 hours
                while digesting a victim.The remains of their victims are excreted below and form the trappers’ treasure troves.A typical trapper can cover about 400 square feet,
                while large ones can cover up to 600 square feet.

                Eggs are laid in a pebble - like mass.Hatchlings resemble flat rocks.Trapper skin may be used to make nonmagical + 1 leather armor.

                Forest Trapper(Miner)

                The forest trapper, or miner, resembles a tailless manta ray mot -
                tled brown or green - brown.Its frontal and dorsal!ridges are hard bone.

                It preys primarily on small forest animals but traps larger crea -
                tures by burrowing beneath paths or roads, then extending the 1 d20 + 5 poisonous, twig - like barbs on its back through the sur -
                face.Passers - by have a 25 % chance(75 %
                    if surprised) of un -
                knowingly stepping on one.If not surprised, druids or rangers have a5 % chance per level of spotting and identifying the barbs.Victims must roll successful saving throws vs.poison or be para -
                lyzed
                for 2 d20 turns.A miner will not surface until all surface movement stops.Then it attacks in the same manner as a subter -
                ranean trapper.

                Miners travel slowly on the surface by rippling like a snake.Burrowing is faster but travel is limited to soil, sand, and gravel.

                Because a miner is always underground unless attacking, it is rarely attacked, The miner 's toxin is Jocated in sacs at the base of
                the barbs, The toxic barbs can be used in a blowgun or as a hand weapon by small creatures, provided the grip is wrapped.

                Eggs are laid in a clutch several feet below the surface.The young feed on burrowing animals
                for their first year.

                Wereboars are humans who are able to transform themselves into a form combining human and boar features.Their tempers are as ugly as their features.

                In human form wereboars tend to be stocky, muscular people of average height, Their hair is short and stiff, They dress in sim -
                ple garments that are easy to remove, repair, or replace.

                The boar form stands slightly taller than the human form, but the hunchbacked posture thrusts the head forward.The head is identical to a boar’ s head, complete with short tusks.The torso’ s diameter is doubled, the neck shortened, and the feet become hoof - like.Stiff, black hair like wire bristles covers the skin.

                Combat: The wereboar combines his hands and tusks

                In human form the wereboar attacks with whatever weapon he has.Wereboars preter bludgeoning or chopping weapons, such as axes and maces, rather than stabbing or missile weapons such as swords, spears, or bows.

                In either form the wereboar is immune to damage from non -
                magical and nonsilver weapons.Such wounds are little more than scratches that quickly heal.

                Habitat / Society; Wereboars are ill - tempered, easily angered,
                and almost as prone to attack their few friends as they are to at -
                tack an enemy.As humans they are rude, crude, and vulgar.However, they are invaluable allies in a fight.A wereboar does not give his friendship easily, but when he does it is a special bond he will not
                break.The problem is, due to the wereboar 's peculiar
                personality, it is difficult to tell whether he is being friendly or hostile.

                Wereboars prefer dense woodlands, ideally far from towns and

                PSN ?





                Females give birth to litters of 1 d4 + 2 offspring.Newborns are very small by human standards but are strong and able to crawl hours after birth.The offspring mature quickly.When they reach adolescence at eight years, they gain the ability to become were -
                boars themselves.A wereboar father appears to be distant and aloof, but a staunch protector who will attack any foe who threatens his family, no matter how uneven the odds.Females are aggressive when defending their young(+2 bonus to attack roll).Neither males nor females check morale when defending their young.

                The diet is a mixture of small game, vegetables, and fungi.Their favorite food is the subterranean fungus called truffles; even in human form they can detect the truffles growing several feet underground.Wereboars aren 't very good gardeners. A typi-
                cal garden is a cleared field strewn with a variety of seeds and bulbs in the hope that something edible will grow.Wereboar cui -
                sine is equally haphazard; it can be summed up as burned meat and stews,

                Wereboars avoid normal hogs and boars.They are suspicious of strangers.Wereboars assume everyone is hostile.In human form they may wait
                for the first attack, but when in boar form they usually(75 % chance) chase the intruders away and attack any who defend themselves.

                Ecology : Wereboars produce little of value, whether trade goods or services.Their main desire is simply to stay away from everyone
                else .In the wild, they defend their territories against
                any intruders, Wereboars fit into orcish society as well as they do
                    into human society, and might sometimes assist or ally them -
                    selves with orcish forces.Wereboars can tolerate half - orcs.

                cities.Like werebears, they live in caves or build cabins
                for their homes.Their homes tend to be ill - kept and slovenly, Wereboars don 't repair things, they replace them.

                Despite their personalities, wereboars have close - knit families.

                A foxwoman is an elven - appearing woman who is able to trans -
                form herself into a silver fox form or a silver - furred humanoid(vixen) form with a fox 's head. They are extremely self-centered.

                The female elven form of the foxwoman is extremely beautiful.She has silver or silver - streaked hair, including a widow 's peak,
                She dresses attractively in loose garments.A pouch holds valu -
                ables and spell components.

                The vixen form is a hybrid of elven and fox - like features.The body and limbs are those of the elven form but covered with sil -
                very fur.The head and tail are fox - like.The vixen may wear elven clothing.The vixen can run very quickly(18),

                if it passes out of view
                for a moment,

                Combat: The silver fox’ s bite inflicts 1 - 2 points of damage but is otherwise harmless.The vixen 's more savage bite causes 2d6
                points of damage.Human or elven women who are bitten by a vixen
                for 50 % or more of their hit points become foxwomen within three days unless both a cure disease and a remove curse spell are cast upon the victim by a priest of at least 12 th level.

                In elven form, the foxwoman relies on weapons.She gains a +
                1 bonus with bow or sword.Her best weapon is her incredible beauty.Any human, humanoid, or demihuman males whose Wisdoms are 13 or less are effectively caught by a charm spell.Those whose Wisdoms are 14 or greater are not charmed but still find the foxwoman extremely attractive, In elven form, the fox -
                woman has magic use as a wizard of level 1 d4.She is 90 % resist -
                ant to sleep and charm spells.

                In any form, the foxwoman is able to see by infravision(60 -
                    foot range).They can only be harmed by silver or + 1 or better magical weapons.Scars from nonfatal wounds vanish within a month.

                Habitat / Society: Foxwomen dwell in lonely woodlands far from humanoid communities.Their homes may be hidden cat -
                tages or comfortably furnished cave complexes; in either
                case the homes are filled with typical human comforts.Foxwomen are sol -
                itary in regard to their own kind.They are self - serving, vain, and hedonistic.Foxwomen serve their vanity by enslaving humanoid









                males.Those males become servants and companions.

                Werefoxes do not keep dwarves, gnomes, or halflings;
                such males are slain quietly as soon as the opportunity arises.

                Each foxwoman is always accompanied by 1 d4 + 1 charmed males.At least one of the males is a fighter(70 % ) or ranger(30 % ) of level 1 d4 + 1. There is a 50 % chance that any one of the other males is also a fighter of level 1 d4.There is a 10 % chance that one of the remaining males is a cleric(10 % ), druid(45 % ), mage(10 % ), thief(25 % ), or some other class(10 % ) of level 1 d4.Of her elven or half - elven companions, 25 % are multi - class characters.All males who do not fit into any of the above categories are Oth -
                    level fighters and elves or half - elves of 1 Hit Die.The males may
                use such magical items as they possessed prior to being charmed into the foxwoman’ 's service.

                Foxwomen are barren.They must kidnap or adopt their chil -
                dren.There is a 10 % chance that a foxwoman has a“ daughter.”The foxwoman has stolen an elven girl, infected her with lycan -
                thropy, and is raising her as a foxwoman.Such a child is be 1 d8 + 5 years old.If she is 12 - 13, she is treated the same as a nor -
                mal foxwoman; otherwise she is a noncombatant.

                Non - elven women who are afflicted with lycanthropy undergo a slow transformation that alters their normal form.Over a per -
                iod of one to two years, such women turn into elven women; only their faces and odd marks(tattoos, birthmarks) provide faint proof of their old identities.

                Ecology:
                    Foxwomen are unique among the lycanthropes.They have no major goals or desires aside from pampering themselves and feeding their vanity.They have little contact with other fox -
                    women(whom they see as rivals), real foxes(irrelevant beasts),
                    or other lycanthropes(crude, unattractive, and uncharmable).

                    Minimals are half - sized breeds of otherwise normal animals,
                    They have the same physical and behavioral traits as their full -
                    sized relatives, although most are not as dangerous.

                    Combat: Minimals fight in the same manner as the normal breeds.Some of the carnivores are even more aggressive.

                    Habitat / Society: Minimals(the popular contraction
                        for“ small animals ") were created by means of spells similar to those used to
                        create giant reptiles, insects, and the like.Minimals tend to be

                        found only in isolated or enclosed regions, There they are 80 %
                        likely to be the only types of mammals around.They seldom exist in areas with large carnivores, since they would be quickly wiped out.

                        Any type of minimal is 50 % likely to be found with greater fre -
                        quency than that given
                        for normal - sized species.Their smaller size decreases their Armor Class by 2 and the movement rate by 1 / 3(rounded up).The species listed above are the most commonly known.Other minimals probably exist in other isolated areas.

                        Minimals are sometimes found with small humanoids(brown -
                            ies, pixies, etc.).This is more likely
                        if the locale is isolated.

                        Minimals that can be domesticated are valued by short human -
                        oids, such as halflings, as pets of this size are easier
                        for them to control.

                        Ecology: Minimals are the result of deliberate tampering with nature by magical means, Aside from their smaller size, they have the same characteristics and needs as their normal - sized kin, Un -
                        like most enlarged monsters, the diminutive minimals have in -
                        creased usefulness and survivability since they require less food and territory.Minimal hides and skins are worth 2 / s that of the normal - sized species.

        Mermen are marine - dwelling, amphibious humanoids with the upper torso of a human and the lower torso of a fish.

        Mermen were once human but were transformed by unknown powers into their current forms.They live by herding fish, but during times of need they attack other sea - peoples or ocean - going vessels.They live underwater but surface to sun themselves on large rocks.

        Adult mermen are five to six feet long(tall) and weigh between 150 and 225 pounds.Their skin tone is fair to tan, hair color is usually dark brown(occasionally fair),
        while their scale color ranges from green to silver.Females, also known as mermaids,
        are six inches shorter than the males and weigh between 100 to 150 pounds.Mermen adorn themselves with coral and shell deco -
        rations.Mermen speak their own language(with different dia -
            lects spoken by communities that are separated over wide distances), and 50 % of all communities also speak locathah.

        Combat: Mermen communities are well - armed, The arms used by mermen are as follows:

        Trident, dagger(50 % ) *
        Crossbow, dagger(30 % ) Javelin, dagger(20 % )

        *
        20 % of all trident wielders are also armed with a hook and grappling line(50 feet long).

        Mermen crossbows have a range of 30 yards underwater.They use grapples to attack ships; the grapples can be thrown up to 50 feet.Each grapple held by 10 mermen slows a ship by 1, Once stopped, the ship is attacked and a hole is knocked in its hull in
        4 d4 rounds, after which the ship slowly sinks, to be looted by the mermen.

        Merman sufter double damage from fire attacks.

        Habitat / Society: For every 20 mermen encountered, there is a patrol leader(2 - 3 HD) and 1 - 3 barracuda(AC 6; Move 30; HD 3;# AT 1; Dmg 2 d4), For every 40 mermen, there is a leader(4 HD).For every 120 mermen encountered, there is one chief(6 HD) and two guards(4 HD).For every ten mermen, there is a 10 % chance









        of a shaman(3 HD, with the spells of a 3 rd - level priest).

        Mermen have regular undersea communities, usually a reef or cliff honeycombed with passages.Rarely(10 % of the time) they construct a village from sea shells and coral.An average commu -
        nity has between 100 and 600 males.Females and sub - adults each equal 100 % of the males ina village.The communities are usually guarded by 3 d6 trained barracudas.

        Mermen society is heavily patriarchal.They prefer to be left to themselves and usually reject proposals of friendship or trade.They have strong territorial instincts and,
        while closely related to humans, they have no love
        for them, Males hunt and herd fish and protect their territory.Females raise children and tend to do -
            mestic affairs.Mermaids are also known
        for their creativity, and they produce works of art
        for the community(shell carvings, sea -
            weed tapestries, and songs).

        Ecology: Mermen are omnivorous, but they preter a diet of fish, lobster, crab, and shellfish.They do not cook these crea -
            tures, but must fillet them before eating.They can survive out of
        water
        for one hour before they begin to dehydrate.When dehy -
        drated, they lose 2 hit points per hour and will die when they reach zero; immersion in fresh or salt water immediately restores these lost hit points.

        Mermen have an average life expectancy of 150 years.Mermen have many natural enemies but particularly hate the sahuagin and ixitxachitl.They often clash with tritons over territory.

        Mimics are magically - created creatures with a hard rock - like outer shell that protects their soft inner organs.Mimics can alter their form and their pigmentation; they use this talent to lure vic -
        tims into close range, where they attempt to feed on them.They usually appear in the form of treasure chests.There are two vari -
        eties, the smaller, more intelligent common mimic, and the larger,
        less intelligent killer mimic.

        Mimics are large.Common mimics occupy about 150 cubic feet(a 3 ' x 6'
            x 8 ' chest, or a large door frame). Killer mimics occupy
            about 200 cubic feet.Mimics’ natural color is a speckled grey that resembles granite.Mimics can alter their pigmentation to resem -
            ble varieties of stone(such as marble), wood grain, and various metals(gold, silver, copper); it takes one round to make the de -
            sired alteration.They cannot lose mass in this transformation(they must remain the same size, though they may radically alter their dimensions).

            Common mimics have their own tongue(corruptions of the original language spoken by their wizard creators) and can also be taught to speak in common and other languages.Killer mimics are incapable of speech.

            Combat: A mimic can surprise its victims easily(-4 penalty to victims’ surprise rolls).When a creature touches a mimic, it lashes out with a pseudopod that inflicts 3 d4 points of damage.Further -
            more, the mimic covers itself with a glue - like substance.Any creature or item that touches a mimic is held fast.Alcohol will weaken the glue in three rounds, enabling the character to
            break free, or the character may attempt to make an open doors roll to
            break free.Only one attempt may be made per character, and no other action, offensive or defensive, may be performed during the round that the attempt is being made.A mimic may neutralize its glue at any time that it desires; the glue dissolves five rounds after the mimic dies.The mimic is immune to acid attacks and is unaf -
            fected by molds, green slime, and various puddings.

            Habitat / Society: Mimics live underground, where they can avoid sunlight.They are solitary creatures; this is to ensure that each mimic has a large grazing area.They have no culture; their primary concerns are survival and food.Common mimics are quite intelligent and will gladly offer information in exchange
            for









            food.Killer mimics attack regardless of attempts at communica -
            tion.Mimics have no moral code and no interest in culture or reli -
            gion.Wizards who use them as guardians have sometimes found them to be less than enthusiastic about obeying their commands,

            Ecology: Mimics were originally created by wizards to protect themselves from treasure hunters.A good meal(one or two hu -
                mans) can sustain them
            for weeks.They reproduce by fission and grow to full size in several years.Mimics pose as stonework,
            doors, statues, stairs, chests, or other common items made from stone, wood, and metal.Their skin is covered with optical sen -
            sors that are sensitive to heat and light in a 90 - foot radius, even in
            pitch darkness.Any powerful light source can easily blind them,
            including direct sunlight.Along with glue, they can excrete a liq -
            uid that smells like rotting meat; this attracts smaller, more com -
            mon prey(usually rats).Mimic ichor is useful in the creation of polymorph self potions, and their glue and solvent sacs can be sold to alchemists.Other internal organs are useful in the manu -
            facture of perfumes, The mimic’ s internal organs are considered tasty delicacies in some cultures.

            Molds are a variety of spore - producing fungi that form in decay -
            ing food or in warm, moist places.These fungi usually have a woolly or furry texture.While most molds are harmless, there are(at least) three varieties of monstrous molds that pose a deadly threat to adventurers: brown, russet, and yellow mold.

            Brown Mold

            Brown mold is found in damp subterranean areas, such as ca -
            verns and caves.It is light to golden brown in color.Brown mold feeds by absorbing heat, even body heat; where brown mold grows, the temperature is below average.Direct sunlight or ultra -
            violet light kills it.

            If a warm - blooded creature comes within five feet of a brown mold, the mold drains heat equal to 4 d8 points of damage from its victim, per round.A ring of warmth provides complete protec -
            tion against this attack.Brown mold grows instantly from heat.If a torch is used in its vicinity, it doubles in size;
            if flaming oil is used, it quadruples, and fireball - type spells cause it to grow eight -
            fold.

            Brown mold is not fed by cold light sources(e.g., light, faerie fire).The only magic that affects it are disintegrate(which de -
                stroys it), plant - affecting magic, and cold spells.Ice storms or walls of ice cause it to go dormant
            for 5 d6 turns.A cold wand,
            white dragon breath, or a cone of cold kills it.Brown mold does not affect cold - using creatures such as white dragons, winter wolves, ice toads, etc.

            Russet Mold

            Russet mold is golden - brown to rust red in color.It has a lumpy texture similar to cold porridge; it is covered by short, hair - like growths that stand upright and wave as
            if they were in a cold breeze.lt resembles rust at distances beyond 30 feet(70 % chance of error).It is immune to weapons and most spells; it is affected

            only by alcohol, acid, and salt, which kill it; a cure disease or a continual light spell also destroys it.

            Russet mold continuously emits a cloud of spores in a three -
            foot radius.All creatures in this cloud suffer 5 d4 points of dam -
            age(per round in the cloud) and must roll a successful saving
            throw vs.poison or become infected with spore sickness.Victims
            of spore sickness are instantly paralyzed and die in 5 d4 minutes unless a cure disease spell is cast on them.

            Anyone who dies from spore sickness undergoes a transtorma -
            tion and begins to sprout russet mold growths; when completely covered in mold(1 d4 + 20 hours), he becomes a vegepygmy.
            (Treat as a juju zombie whose touch affects victims as russet mold and that cannot be turned by priests).A hold plant spell will halt the growth of the mold
            for the duration of the spell,
            while a cure disease spell destroys it within an hour after death; after that, a wish is necessary to destroy it.

            Yellow Mold

            This mold is pale yellow to golden orange in color.If touched roughly, it may(50 % chance) emit a cloud of spores in a ten - foot radius.Any creature caught in this cloud must roll a successful saving
            throw vs.poison or die.A cure disease spell and a resur -
                rection spell within 24 hours are necessary to restore life.

            Fire of any sort destroys yellow mold.A continual light spell renders it dormant
            for 2 d6 turns,

            Yellow mold colonies of over 300 square feet are sometimes sentient(1 in 6 chance).These molds sense creatures within 60 feet, and may project their spores that distance.Twice per day,
            they may use a suggestion on someone within that radius; in addi -
            tion to the saving
            throw, the victim must successfully roll an In -
            tellizence check or lose 1 point of Intelligence permanently(it is devoured by the mold).Mongrelman

                Mongrelmen are a mixture of the blood of many species: humans,
                ores, gnolls, ogres, dwarves, hobgoblins, elves, bugbears, bully -
                wugs, and many others.Their appearance varies greatly, combin -
                ing the worst features of their parent stocks.They are usually clad in dirty rags; they are ashamed of their appearance and
                try keep their bodies concealed, especially among strangers.They have no distinct tongue of their own, but speak a debased common, mixed with grunts, whistles, growls, and gestures.Their names often mimic animal noises.

                Combat: Mongrelmen have three special abilities that help them to survive: mimicry, pickpocketing, and camouflage.

                Mimicry enables them to imitate the sounds made by any mon -
                ster or creature they have encountered(except
                    for special attack forms[groaning spirits death wail,
                        for instance], which they can -
                    not imitate).

                Pickpocketing enables them to acquire items that they could not otherwise obtain(they have a 70 % chance of success).

                Camouflage enables them to hide themselves and their items with great skill.The base chance of being unnoticed is 80 % , and it requires one turn
                for camouflage to be performed.Each addi -
                tional turn spent preparing the camouflage increases the chance by 1 % , toa maximum of 95 % (after 16 turns).Successfully cam -
                ouflaged persons or items are not noticed unless they are moved or touched(or move themselves, in the
                    case of creatures).Cam -
                ouflaged buildings are usually unnoticeable or unrecognizable at ranges greater than 50 feet(this varies with size and type of struc -
                    ture)

                Mongrelmen normally fight with clubs and swords, but 5 % of the members of any group encountered are armed with blowguns and poison or paralyzing darts.







                Habitat / Society: For every 10 mongrelmen encountered, there is at least one with 2 Hit Dice;
                for every 30, there is one with 3 Hit Dice; and
                for every 40, there is one with 4 Hit Dice.In a commu -
                nity where they are not held as thralls, there are usually a leader(AC 4, Move 12, HD 5, Dmg 1 d12, +1 bonus to attack roll) and tive bodyguards(HD 4),

                Because of their appearance, mongrelmen are seldom welcome in any lawful or good society, and are usually enslaved or abused by evil or chaotic groups.Thus mongrelmen are found as either slaves or serfs, working long hours
                for evil humans or humanoids in a dismal community, or as refugees living in abandoned ruins.Enslaved mongrelmen are not willing to rebel, but wait patiently
                for their masters to be destroyed by outside torces.They preter to live an orderly day - to - day existence.

                A mongrelman prides itself in the ability to survive; they con -
                sider the title“ The Survivor” to be more esteemed than“ The Great.”For them, patience is a greater virtue than being good at the arts of war.A mongrelman performs acts of violence only in
                self - defense or( in the
                    case of slaves) on the orders of their mas -
                ters; free mongrelmen do not hesitate to kill anyone they believe
                threatens their community.They prefer to avoid contact with other creatures except in times of great need, when they
                try to steal what they require(food, tools, etc.),

                Free mongrelmen raise domestic game and grow fruits and veg -
                etables.They have a long tradition of art, music, and literature.Their songs are a bizarre cacophony of animal songs mixed with mournful dirges and wails; a few sages consider them to be beau -
                titul, but most disagree.

                Ecology: Mongrelmen are omnivorous, but their teeth are most efficient at eating meat.The life span of a free mongrelman is be -
                tween 25 and 35 years; the average slave lives only 15 to 20 years.Their intant mortality rate is very high.Their major enemies are tribes of wandering humanoids that hunt them
                for sport.

                    Of all the creatures that inhabit the deep, only the kraken exceeds the morkoth in malice and cruelty.Also known as the“ wraith of the deep”, the morkoth lurks in tunnels hoping to lure its victims into a trap from which they cannot escape.

                    The descriptions given by those who have encountered morkoths contain considerable variation, so no one is certain what they really look like.They are usually said to resemble an intelligent fish with an octopus 's beak. They are most frequently
                    described as being between five to six feet long, inky black in
                    color, with faint luminescent silver patches.They may have fins
                    for arms and legs that vaguely resemble those of humans, and a number of fins
                    for navigation and propulsion in the depths Morkoths have infravision with a 90 - foot range.They speak their own language

                    Combat: A morkoth attacks by snapping with its squid - like beak, which inflicts 1 d10 points of damage.A morkoth lives at -
                    he center of six spiraling tunnels, each of which leads to a central chamber.These tunnels are narrow(only one size M creature may enter at atime, and no size L).Asa victim passes over a tunnel, he is drawn in by a hypnotic pattern, which leads him toward the central chamber, As the victim is drawn into the central chamber,
                    he approaches the morkoth without realizing it and must roll a successful saving
                    throw vs.spell with a - 4 penalty or be charmed.
                    A charmed vic tim 15 devoured at the morkoth’ s leisure.lt the morkoth doesn 't charm the victim before he comes within 60 feet,
                    the hypnotic effect of the tunnels is broken.

                    A morkoth is highly resistant to magic.It reflects any spell that is cast at it back to the caster, including spells with an area of ef -
                    fect.If a dispel magic is simultaneously cast with a spell, there isa 50 % chance the morkoth will be unable to reflect it, though it is entitled to a saving
                    throw vs.the dispel.

                    Habitat / Society: Morkoths are normally solitary creatures.They sometimes make alliances with kraken, oftering their help in exchange
                    for an occasional slave.If approached by evil sea hu -
                    manoids
                    for assistance, morkoths may strike a bargain but often yetray their“ allies” at the most opportune moment.

                    Morkoths rarely leave their tunnels.The tunnels are originally natural, but are slowly carved over the course of centuries by the

                    Yi) iff, nee« shige ih ie L Ui





                morkoths so that the central chamber grows larger.Morkoths sometimes build their tunnels near hot air vents, so the water in
                morkoth lairs may be warmer than normal.

                Morkoths realize that other intelligent creatures like treasure,
                so they collect belongings from the creatures they kill to use in
                bargaining with other creatures, They place no value on gold or gems or even magical items.Morkoths enjoy deception above all
                else .They do not enslave their victims,
                    if only because their appe -
                tites are so fierce that slaves would not survive long.

                Ecology: According to the most popular theories, morkoths are a species of tish with human and squid influences.Sages are un -
                sure
                if this species occurred by chance or design.Morkoths are carnivorous and will eat nearly any sea creature.Their usual diet is deep - water creatures such as sharks, octopi, kuo - toans, and sa -
                huagin.The life spans of male morkoths are about 80 to 100 years,
                while females die after egg - laying.

                Once every ten years, a morkoth leaves its tunnels and wan -

                for a mate, leaving a distinctive odor trail that is easy
                for morkoths to identify and follow, After mating, the male morkoth returns to its tunnels and the female lays a clutch of about 25 eggs, which she buries in the ocean floor.She then dies.The eggs hatch in two months, and the immature morkoths strug -
                gle to survive, instinctively searching
                for vacant tunnels, Most hatchlings die on this journey.

                Muckdwellers are a species of small intelligent bipedal amphib -
                ians that lurks in swamps, marshes, or still, mud - bottomed wa -
                ters.They have been known to serve lizard men and kuo - toa.

                Muckdwellers are only one foot tall and resemble upright gila monsters with large, partially webbed rear feet, Their forepaws are prehensile, but very small and weak.Their backs are colored a mottled gray and brown, and their underbellies are yellow.They have short tails that are used
                for swimming and keeping their balance on land.They speak their own hissing language and possibly(50 % chance) the lizard man tongue.

                Combat: Muckdwellers use ambush techniques.Packs of muckdwellers wait
                for a victim; when one arrives, several squirt water(at up to a ten - yard range) into the victim 's eyes, which
                temporarily blinds it(a successful saving
                    throw vs, wands negates
                    this, but surprised creatures get no saving

                thermore,
                if the muckdwellers lure the victim into knee - deep muddy waters, the victim loses all Dexterity bonuses and fights with a - 1 penalty to its attack roll, due to unsteady ground.If the water is waist - high, the penalty increases to - 2;
                if the water is chest - high, the penalty is - 3. A ring of free action or equivalent magic negates these penalties.These disadvantages do not apply
                to the amphibious muckdwellers.Usually, a muckdweller fights only
                if it is cornered or
                if it is certain it can score a easy kill.

                Habitat / Society: The lair of these creatures is underwater, but they always have a muddy above - water area
                for resting, sunning themselves, and eating.There are 5 d4 muckdwellers in each lair.They keep shiny - things(gold, gems, etc.) in a hoard in their aboveground lair.If 16 or more monsters are encountered in this lair, they have double the given type Q treasure.

                Muckdwellers are an intelligent species, but they have very lit -
                tle culture.They have a very primitive nature worship that em -

                    Myconids, or fungus men, are a race of intelligent fungi that lives in remote reaches of the Underdark.They are cautious creatures that deplore violence; myconids have no desire to conquer any -
                    body and would prefer to be left alone.

                    Myconids resemble walking toadstools in human form.Their flesh is bloated and spongy and varies in color from purple to gray.Their wide feet have vestigial toes and their pudgy hands have two stubby fingers and a thumb on either side.Myconids’ Hit Dice determine their social status and abilities.They have no spoken language.

                    Combat: Fungus men fight by clubbing with their clasped hands, causing 1 d4 points of damage per Hit Die.Thus a 1 - Hit Die myconid inflicts 1 d4 points of damage, a 2 - Hit Die myconid causes 2 d4 points of damage, etc., up to the 6 - Hit Dice king that inflicts 6 d4 points of damage on a hit.

                    Myconids also have the ability to spew forth clouds of special spores, The number and kind of spores increase as they grow.As each myconid advances to another size level, it gains the ability to spray another type of spores, and the number of times per day that each spore type can be emitted also increases.A myconid can emit each of its spore types a number of times per day equal to its Hit Dice.For example, a 3 - HD myconid(six feet tall) can spray three types of spores, and it may use each type three times per day.These spore types include the following:

                    Distress: This spore type is used to alert other myconids to danger or a need
                    for aid.The cloud expands at a rate of 40 feet per round, expanding to its maximum of 120 feet in three rounds.This ability is gained at the 1 - Hit Die level.

                    Reproducer: These spores are only emitted at the proper time
                    for growing new myconids so the population can be rigidly con -
                    trolled.They are also automatically ejected by a dying myconid.This ability is gained at the 2 - Hit Dice level.

                    Rapport: These spores are primarily used in the melding proc -

                        for the fungus men to fear sunlight as they do .

                        Habitat / Society: Myconid society is based on“ circles, ”ex -
                        tremely tight social groups that are linked by group work and melding sessions.Myconid circles usually consist of 20 members:
                        four of each size from 1 - 5 Hit Dice(i.e., four 1 - HD, four 2 - HD,
                            etc.).Each community consists of 1 d10 circles.

                        Each circle 's day is rigidly structured: eight hours of rest, fol-

                        tive telepathic hallucination
                        for eight hours.Myconids consider this melding to be the reason
                        for their existence.Only distress spores will bring a circle out of its meld before the eight hours have elapsed.

                        The myconid king is always the largest member of the colony and is the only member at the 6 - Hit Dice level.It is also the only myconid that is not the member of a circle.The other myconids regard separation from the circles with horror and pity the lonely king.The leadership role is thought of as an unpleasant duty, al -
                        most a condemnation.However, when the old king dies, the strongest 5 - Hit Dice myconid always assumes the role of the new king.The king must remain outside of circles to retain objectivity and to pay close attention to the duties of leadership.The king an -

                        for the colony so the myconids need not commit violence.It coordinates the work schedule and pays attention to affairs outside the colony that could affect the fungus men, The king also practices fungal alchemy, brewing special potions that may be useful in times of trouble.

                        In general, myconids are a peaceful race, desiring only to work and meld in peace.There are no recorded instances of dishar -
                        mony, or any sort of violence or disagreement between my -
                        conids.If forced into combat, they avoid killing
                        if at all possible; violence adversely affects their melding.

                        covered stones, on which the circle members sit when they meld,
                        and on which they sleep, There will also be a large garden area; the myconids feed on water and small fungi, and the king uses the garden ingredients to make his potions.Dead myconid kings are buried with honor beneath the mounds,
                        while dead myconids are buried near the gardens.

                        Ecology: Myconids are an unusual species of fungi.They grow fungi, which later decay, and the myconids feed from these soil nutrients,

                        A myconid has a life span of 24 years, It requires four years to grow to each Hit Die, thus a 1 - Hit Die myconid is four years old,
                        a 2 - Hit Die myconid is eight years old, etc., to a maximum of 5 Hit Dice at 20 years of age.It requires a special regimen
                        for a my -
                        conid to reach 6 Hit Dice(king).

                        A myconid king has the ability to brew magical potions from fungi.In addition to standard magical potions, a myconid king can brew the following:

                        Potion of Fungus Growth: This is used in times of population shortage, when myconid circles need their young members to grow quickly.This potion increases a myconid’ s Hit Dice by 1. It can only be used on a myconid once in its lifetime; repeated doses have no effect.

                        Potion of Fungus Healing: This potion only works on fungi.It heals 1 d6 + 1 lost hit points.

                        Potion of Decay: This poison affects a humanoid creature as

                        within three minutes of the infection.The combination of a cure disease spell and a raise dead spell will bring back victims of the fungus disease after 48 hours, This potion is rarely used by the fungus men.

                        Powders of Hallucination: This is used when hallucinatory spores are in short supply due to the death of 4 - and 5 - Hit Die members of the circles.It is also used as a defensive measure when myconids are certain they are going to be attacked; a powder is bundled and placed on a spider - silk film inside the entrance to their circle.Creatures of size M will

                        ing all creatures in a 20 - foot radius as hallucinatory spores.

                        Potion of Anointment; This is the special regimen that enables a 5 - Hit Die fungus to grow to 6 Hit Dice and become king.Growth is immediate and painful.It affects a myconid only once.It is poisonous to humans(successful saving

                        There is always one potion of anointment in the community.If other potions are indicated, consult the following table;

                        01 - 10 Another potion of anointment 11 - 20 Potion of fungi growth

                        21 - 30 Potion of fungus healing 31 - 40 Powder of hallucination

                        41 - 45 Potion of decay

                        46 - 00 Roll on standard potion table

                        Alchemists have found a number of uses

                            The cold - blooded naga have glittering scales and grow to an adult length of 10 to 20 feet.Their lidless eyes are bright and wide, almost luminescent, and their spines are armored with sharp triangular extensions that grow in a line from the napes of their necks to the tips of their tails.Wise and patient, these crea -

                            Naga can usually speak four or more languages.

                            Combat: Naga often set traps to snare trespassers, Magical spells are always attempted first, since naga have few melee skills.Once their magic is expended, naga rely on their poisonous bites— only the largest of these creatures can actually constrict victims like a giant snake.

                            Habitat / Society: Naga live solitary lives, hunting or foraging over an area usually only a quarter mile square.They favor dwelling in a deep hole, but sometimes are found curled up in ru -

                        Many a male has thrown his life away
                        for the fleeting embrace of the“ honeyed ones, ’the beautiful nereids from the elemental plane of Water.Playful and flighty, and as unpredictable as their watery homes, the nereids tempt and trick sailors to their dooms.

                        capable of harming the creature(no saving
                            throw), and it seems to be a shy and flirtatious girl playing by the shore.

                        Nereid are capricious, but whether they are good, neutral, or evil depends on the individual, with the majority(50 % ) being chaotic neutral in their actions.

                        Combat: As creatures of the element water, nereids have few physical attacks should their roles as sirens fail.Nereids can spit a venom up to 20 feet that blinds a target
                        for 2 d6 rounds
                        if it hits,

                        Nereids can control the waters of their lair out to a distance of 30 feet, and they often do this to form pleasant watery shapes to
                        amuse and entertain themselves.This power can also be used to defend against invaders by causing the waters to heave in great waves that slow movement to '/a normal or by making the water

                        reids can cause the waves to crash with a enormous roar so great that characters within 60 feet may be deafened

                        If a nereid is caught by an amorous man, it rolls a saving

                        if successful, it flows away like water.The nereid also gets a saving
                        throw vs.poison to avoid damage from a
                        weapon.Most men or demihumans
                        try to
                        catch a nereid to gain a kiss.While it is loath to give these, in its kisses lie its final defense— once their lips touch, the character must roll a success -
                        ful saving
                        throw vs.breath weapon, with a - 2 penalty, or drown
                        instantly.If he doesn’ t drown, he finds total ecstacy.

                        The nereid protects its shaw!at all costs, since it contains the nereid’ s essence and
                        if it is destroyed the nereid will dissolve into formless water.Possession of a nereid 's shaw! gives a character
                        control over the fearful creature, and it can be commanded to do
                            one’ s bidding.A nereid will lie and attempt anything short of hos -

                        Habitat / Society: Nereids can be found in the sea, rivers, wells,
                        mountain and cavern springs, and on the elemental plane of Wa -

                        covered a means to escape from their plane of existence, or have been deposited in this world as punishment.Usually one nereid is located in a certain body of water, but sometimes a group of 1 d4 creatures lives in an area, especially along an ocean front or in
                        shoals around a rocky and deserted island.A group of nereid join together because of like alignment, and control of the group is al -
                        ways held by the eldest.

                        Fresh, clean waters sustain them,
                        while polluted waters drain their vigor and often cause them to move to a new place.Even good nereids have been known to attack those who wantonly pollute their lairs.While they don’ t need food, they hunt or fish
                        for their pets, and evil nereids lure men and demihumans close so that their pets may feed.They don’ t value metals and discard gold and silver, but any magical treasure they gain from a fallen sailor or amorous fool is saved in their watery lair.True to its nature,
                        the nereid has no goals or ambitions, choosing instead to splash and cavort in the waters, to the delight of males everywhere.

                        Ecology: These creatures take little from the environment and give little in
                        return .Powerful sea captains might wear nereid
                        shawls as scarves, to show their command over the creatures of the sea; the forlorn nereids can be glimpsed following in the wake of their ships, sobbing and begging
                        for the
                        return of their es -
                            sences.These shawls command handsome sums from those who
                        need the services of a water creature, but they are seldom sold and are very scarce.It is rumored that wizards who hold a shawl use their enslaved nereid as a guide on journeys to the elemental plane of Water.

                            Pitch colored and thick, like a luxuriant black carpet, obliviax grows in small patches and spreads through spores.Its leaves and flowers are all glossy black.When it lacks stolen memories it quivers, as
                            if inanticipation.It smells like damp, loamy dirt, a very unappetizing odor.Although it requires no sunlight to grow,

                            If an obliviax with stolen memories is attacked, in one round it forms a part of itself into a tiny moss imitation of the creature whose memories it stole.This mossling remains attached to the parent moss and defends the plant by casting any stolen spells.This is the moss’ s only defense.

                            Habitat / Society: Obliviax grows in tropical to temperate climes, but cannot abide too much water or cold.It does not grow in desert terrain.It is not uncommon to find patches on tree

                    The dreaded“ cuttlefish” are the scourge of ocean - going sailors and fishermen.Malicious and cunning, giant octopi have been known to attack ships, sinking smaller craft and stealing crew members from the larger ships.

                    Giant octopi change their color to blend into their surround -
                    ings, and the range of colors and patterns available to them is ex -
                    tensive, from green to deep black, blue speckles and red stripes.Tentacles are often disguised as seaweed.Once camouflaged,
                    there is only a 10 % chance to detect them, and usually it is their eyes that give them away.Normal coloration is grey to brown,
                    and their vicious beaks are a deep yellow with a bright orange mouth and tongue.

                    Combat: An octopus will readily attack swimmers or small ves -
                    sels in order to eat the crew.Several have been known to cooper -
                    ate in order to overwhelm a larger ship, and any craft seized by these monsters loses way and comes to a full stop in three turns.

                    A giant octopus generally attacks with six of its eight tentacles,
                    using two to anchor itself.Each striking tentacle causes 1 d4 points of damage, but unless the member is loosened or severed,
                    it constricts
                    for 2 d4 points of damage every round after striking.If a victim is dragged close enough to the beak, the monster can bite
                    for 2 d6 points of damage.

                    Any victim under eight feet tall or long can be struck by only one tentacle at a time, and the chance that both upper limbs are pinned on a successful strike is 25 % ,
                    while the chance that both upper limbs are free is also 25 % .When both upper limbs are held,
                    the victim has no attack;
                    if only one limb is held the victim at -
                    tacks with a - 3 penalty to its attack roll;
                    if both limbs are free(i.e.,
                        the tentacle is wrapped around the victim 's body) then the victim
                        attacks with a - 1 penalty to its attack roll.Tentacles grip with a Strength of 18 / 20, Any creature with a Strength equal to or greater than 18 / 20 can grasp the tentacle and negate its constric -
                        tion.This does not free the victim, and the octopus will immedi -
                        ately seek to drag the victim to its mouth to eat it.To
                        break free, a tentacle must be severed; this requires 8 points of damage.(These hit points are in addition to those the octopus gains from its 8 Hit Dice.)

                        Once three or more tentacles are severed, it is 90 % probable that the octopus will retreat, ejecting a cloud of black ink 40 feet



                        high by 60 feet wide by 60 feet long.This ink cloud completely obscures the vision of any creature within it.The wounded octo -
                        pus then camouflages itself in its lair or a nearby hiding place.It takes the monster two to three months to grow back severed ten -
                        tacles.

                        Habitat / Society: While octopi cooperate to attack a food source, they live a solitary existence, preferring to shelter in
                        warm water of medial to shallow depth.Lairs are made in
                        wrecked ships and undersea caves; any treasure found there is just an incidental leftover from previous meals.Consummate hunters, these monsters have great patience and cover a very small area, waiting
                        for their food to come to them.Mating season comes every spring.Like most marine animals, octopi leave their eggs in a reef to fend
                        for themselves.

                        Giant octopi’ s leathery hide is tough and waterproof, and it is worked into fine rain ponchos by sailors lucky enough to

                            like teeth.Most specimens have six legs, but some(25 % ) have eight and there a few rare creatures(5 % ) have ten.The creature 's

                            Combat: The osquip is ferocious and will attack without fear,

                            terity(its hide is AC 9).If battle goes against it, it tries to flee into its tunnels;
                            if cornered, it uses its teeth to dig an escape tunnel.Its teeth are sharp enough to dig through stone.

                            Habitat / Society: The creature often has its lair in the midst of a complex of tunnels beneath the basements of buildings or dungeons.The tunnel system is quite extensive and the entrances to it, which are too small to permit the comfortable passage of a human or other man - sized creature, are carefully hidden(the chance of finding them is the same as the chance of finding a se -
                                cret door),

                            Osquips have the same mentality as a packrat; they travel in
                            large groups(the largest recorded is 24) and are attracted to bright shiny objects, which constitutes their treasure.It is not easy to domesticate an osquip.Some wizards have successfully done so,
                            using magic, Some subterranean creatures such as jermlaine have also tried with limited success; osquips sometimes(10 % chance) can be controlled with judicious bribes of food, but they do not
                            like to
                            let go of their shiny treasures and react angrily
                            if someone tries to take treasure away from them.

                            Osquips are extremely territorial and attack creatures that in -

                            ing, they get very aggressive, exploring every nook of the tunnel and attacking whatever they finds, particularly giant rats and jermlaine, They treat larger(human - sized) creatures with cau -

                            try to ward invaders away with a warning hiss, but they will attack without warning
                            if they have a good chance to surprise.

                            Osquips have above - average cunning.They are not afraid of fire but are not very good swimmers(50 % of them will drown,
                                while 50 % paddle along slowly at a movement rate of 1).

                            Ecology: Osquips feed on rats, mice, and other small rodents,
                            sometimes even other packs of osquips.Like all rodents, they are mammalian, with three to five osquips produced per litter.They have a life expectancy of nine years.Osquip leather is soft and well - insulated against cold and rainy weather; it is used by tan -
                            ners and tailors to make purses and coats.

                            Some osquips have been domesticated by certain wizards with a liking

                            tic hasn 't worked as well as the wizards hoped, chiefly because
                            the tunnels dug by the osquips are almost always too small, and the osquips don 't always move in the desired direction. Some
                            wizards use osquip teeth as a component in magic involving dig -

                Otyughs(Aw - tee - ug), also known as the gulguthra, are terrifying creatures that lurk in heaps of dung and decay, waiting
                for some -
                thing to disturb it.There are two varieties, the regular otyugh,
                and its larger, more intelligent offshoot, the neo - otyugh.They feed on dung and wastes from other dungeon creatures(gulguthra means“ dung eaters”) but also enjoy an occasional snack of fresh meat,

                Otyughs have huge, bloated bodies covered with a rock - like skin that is brownish gray in color, which is in turn covered with dung.They stand on three thick legs that give them slow ground movement but enable them to pivot quickly.They have three eyes on a leaf - like stalk that moves quickly from side to side, enabling them to scan a large area.The eye stalk is also a receiver /
                transmitter
                for their telepathic abilities.Otyughs have a huge mouth with very sharp teeth in the center of their mass.They also have two tentacles with leaf - like ridges that they use to smash and grapple their opponents.The tentacles are covered with rough thorn - like projections.Neo - otyughs have smaller mouths than otyughs.

                Otyughs and neo - otyughs speak their own language, much of which is non - verbal(movements of eye stalk and tentacles, or emission of certain smells); they also have limited telepathy that enable them to communicate with other creatures.Otyughs reek of dung and decay.

                Combat: Otyughs lurk under piles of offal with only their eyes exposed.They usually attack
                if they feel threatened, or
                if they are hungry and there is fresh meat nearby.They attack with their two ridged tentacles, which either smash an opponent or grapple it.Grappled opponents suffer 2 - 4 points of damage per round, Oty -
                ughs’ bite attacks gaina + 2 bonus to the attack roll when biting grappled opponents.Otyughs smash grappled opponents to the ground,
                while the more intelligent neo - otyughs use their victims as shields, bettering their Armor Class by 1. Neo - otyughs may













                also force attackers to hit the grappled character with a successful attack roll of its own(vs.the grappled character 's AC); to do this
                    the neo - otyugh forgoes its squeeze attack.Characters with a Strength of at least 18 can struggle
                    for one round and automati -
                    cally
                    break free; others must make a successful open doors roll to escape.

                    Both types of gulguthra are disease - ridden; their bite is 90 %
                    likely to infect the character with a debilitating(80 % ) or fatal(20 % ) disease.Otyughs are immune to these diseases.

                    Habitat / Society: All gulguthra have limited telepathic ability.An otyugh can communicate with creatures up to 40 feet away,
                    while a neo - otyugh can communicate with creatures as distant as 60 feet.Communication is usually limited to simple feelings and emotions such as hunger, temperature conditions and associated discomforts, its dislike of bright lights, and imminent death
                    for its prey.Gulguthra also have infravision with a 90 - foot range.

                    Otyughs and neo - otyughs live in ruins and dungeons.They make deals with other dungeon denizens, agreeing not to attack them in exchange
                    for their dung and body wastes, which they then devour.To keep the supply of waste coming(and to get fresh meat) they will agree to help defend their home against intruders,
                    which includes many adventurers.Otyughs may be persuaded not to attack creatures in exchange
                    for promises of friendship and food.Neo - otyughs are less trusting(and more vicious), and usu -
                    ally attack intruders on sight.An otyugh’ s dungeon allies will sometimes ask it to guard treasure
                    for them.Most gulguthra live alone; 10 % of the time, during mating season, two gulguthra can found in its lair.

                    Ecology: Otyughs and neo - otyughs live underground in heaps of offal and refuse.They hate bright sunlight, preferring the com -
                    fortable darkness of dungeons.They mate each year
                    for one month, with one offspring produced.It takes the newborn four months to mature(immature gulguthra have 3 - 5 HD, damage 1 -
                        6 / 1 - 6 / 1 - 2, and a Strength of 16 is required to
                        break free of their grasp).Otyughs are so disgusting that no alchemist or wizard would want to touch their components, so the corpses of the gulguthra have no known use or value.

                    With the exception of the shark, there is no more feared fish than the piranha, the terror of tropical rivers.For sheer voraciousness,
                    the piranha has no equals.There are many tales of cattle unfortu -
                    nate enough to enter piranha - infested waters being stripped to the bone in a few minutes by these creatures.Piranha attack any -
                    thing, including humans.

                    Piranhas are small fish, averaging between eight and ten inches long.The largest normal piranha recorded was measured at two feet.They are either silver or black in color, with a saw - edged belly and large, triangular - shaped teeth that close in a scissor -
                    bite.

                    Combat: Piranhas attack with their sharp teeth.A single bite,
                    though painful, is not usually fatal.Piranhas travel in groups(known as shoals) of 5 - 50. There is a 75 % chance that at least one of them will attack any creature that swims or wades near the shoal.If they attack and one of them draws blood with a hit, the entire shoal goes berserk and each piranha attacks twice per me -
                    lee round(double their normal attack rate).Up to 20 piranhas can attack a single man - sized individual simultaneously.

                    Habitat / Society; Piranhas live in tropical environments.They are more abundant in large river systems.They are merciless predators and aggressive even out of water(though, like most fish, they suffocate in a matter of minutes without water).Like sharks, piranhas are attracted to the scent of blood, and blood in
                    the water quickly drives them into a feeding frenzy.

                    Ecology: Piranhas are meat - eaters; their usual diet is fish, but they will eat any animal that enters their territory.They have no natural enemies, Their cutting teeth, like those of sharks, pull the flesh from their victim as they attack, They are capable of repro -
                    duction(which occurs year round) after only a few months of life,
                    and their life span is about four years.

                    There are no common uses
                    for piranhas, either as trade goods or magical components.Primitive tribes might use piranha teeth as a decoration.Piranhas are occasionally sought after by evil wizards and lords, who use them to populate their moats.

                    Quippers are fresh water piranhas that survive in colder, temper -

                    spects except
                    for reproduction: Being native to a colder climate,
                    they produce offspring only in the spring and summer months.Quippers are sometimes found in dungeon water traps.

                    Giant Piranha

                    Giant piranhas have the same coloration as normal piranhas but much longer bodies.They are capable of reaching great speeds in
                    the water.There is a 95 % chance that at least one of them attacks any creature that swims or wades near the shoal.If they attack and one of them draws blood witha hit, the entire shoal goes ber -
                    serk and each piranha attacks twice per round.Up to eight giant piranhas can attack a single man - sized individual at the same time.

                    Giant piranhas are sometimes called sky - eaters; once per round they can charge at full speed and leap out of the water at heights of up to ten feet; they often use this attack on water fowl that fly low over the water, but they sometimes use it against humans.

                    Giant piranhas are silver in color with dark bands.Compared to normal piranhas, their reproduction rate is low, but their life span is proportionately longer(8 - 10 years).

                Of all of the magical faerie - kin(brownies, sprites, nixies, lepre -
                    chauns, and pixies), pixies are perhaps the most intelligent and mischievous.These naturally invisible creatures dwell in idyllic woodlands and take a particular delight in harassing travelers with their pranks.

                Pixies are elfin creatures, about 2 '/2 feet tall. When visible,
                their facial features resemble those of elves(with proportionately longer ears).They have two silver moth wings that enable them to fly.Pixies dress in brightly colored clothing, and often wear a cap and a pair of shoes with curled and pointed toes.Pixies have their own language, but can also speak the language of sprites and the common tongue.

                Combat: Pixies carry tiny swords and bows.Their swords are equivalent to daggers.Their bows have half the range of a short bow.They use three types of arrows, each which has a + 4 bonus to the attack roll(THACO 16), The first arrow is their war arrow,
                which inflicts 1 d4 + 1 points of damage.The second type causes sleep in a comatose state
                for 1 d6 hours to any creature that fails its saving
                throw vs.spell when struck.The third attack does not
                physically harm the target, but the target must roll a saving
                throw vs.spell.Failure indicates that the victim has suffered a complete loss of memory which can only be restored by a clerical heal spell or a limited wish.

                Pixies can, once per day, become visible at will, polymorph themselves at will, create illusions with both audial and visual components which last without concentration until magically dispelled, and know alignment.Pixies can, by touch, cause con -

                Habitat / Society: Pixies live in deep forest caves, dancing in
                moonlit glades to the music of crickets and frogs.They prefer to live away from humans, but close enough to bother them.Pixies are pranksters who especially love to lead travelers astray.They use their illusion powers to accomplish this, hence the expression“ pixie - led”
                for one who has lost his way.They like to frighten young maidens, rap on walls, blow out candles, and play on wa -
                ter.

                Pixies love to trick misers into giving away their treasure, espe -
                cially by convincing them that something horrible will happen to them
                if they don’ t give it away.While pixies don’ t carry treasure with them, they sometimes have a large hoard in their lair to im -
                press visitors.Pixies sometimes use their treasure to whet greedy people 's appetites, and then play merciless pranks on them until
                they abandon their search
                for the pixies’ fortune(e.g., placing a trail of treasure that leads someone into a trap).If their victim demonstrates that he is not greedy and shows a good sense of hu -
                mor about their pranks, then the pixies give that individual his pick of one item from their hoard.

                Pixies dwell together in a community of clans or families that seem to mimic human customs.Each family has a last name, and family and community loyalty is very important to pixies.

                Ecology: Pixies, like all faerie - kin, are creatures of magic.Pixies eat fruits and nectar, holding mock feasts and revels as they cele -

                for larger creatures to simulate this ability(
                    for as long as the dust lasts).Fifty pixie wings are enough
                for one dose of the powder.

                Of the many hazards in the wilds, carnivorous plants are among the most frightening.These plants feed on animals, perhaps as nature 's revenge on animals for their habit of feeding on plants.

                Choke Creeper

                The choke creeper, or strangler vine, seems to be a cousin of the hangman tree, lt appears as a long, very thick vine with four branches per ten - foot section.The vine is olive green in color, and the plant stem is almost as thick as a tree trunk.

                A choke creeper has 1 hp / HD tor every 20 feet in length it at -
                tains.Thus a choke creeper with maximum(200) hit points is 160 feet long and has 64 branches.Vines creep at a rate of five feet per round via the use of flexible tendrils.Vines are attracted to light and heat.Each branch is capable of an attack and has 2 hit points per 20 - foot length of the parent vine(thus a 20 - foot vine would have branches with 2 hit points,
                    while a 160 - foot vine 's branches
                    would each have 16 hp).These hit points are in addition to the hit points from the 25 Hit Dice of the parent vine.

                A maximum of four branches may attack a single target.They appear to be normal vegetation and can usually grab unsuspect -
                ing victims.Victims can attempt to
                break free by making a bend bars / lift gates roll;
                if the roll fails, they are held fast until the branch that holds them is severed.Held victims suffer 1 d4 points of damage per round, with a 10 % chance per round that the creeper will use a strangling grip.The victim dies after one round of strangulation.

                A choke creeper is not affected by small, torch - sized fires, but a very hot fire(such as a flask of oil) can cause damage and force mobile vines to move away.Cold inflicts 1 point of damage per damage die and immobilizes the plant sections struck
                for 1 d4 + 1 rounds, Electrical attacks double the movement rate of the plant
                for 1 d4 + 1 rounds and cause no damage to the plant.

                Hangman Tree

                Hangman trees are named
                for their rope - like appendages.Hang -
                man trees are deciduous, resembling a thick oak with few branches and sparse foliage.Sensory organs resemble knot - like protuberances and are usually located high on the trunk.The lower trunk has a scar - like place
                for expulsion of indigestibles.Saplings can move at six feet per hour,
                while older trees can move at only two feet per hour.

                Their shallow root systems and small number of leaves require them to supplement their nutrition by direct ingestion of protein, 

                Plant, Carnivorous

                thus each tree traps its prey.During freezing weather, a taproot is put down and the tree is dormant.

                Each hangman tree has a hallucinatory perfume that it can re -
                lease at will, usually doing so
                while prey is 30 to 80 feet distant.This causes the recipient to believe that this is an ordinary tree, or a treant, depending on the mood of the hangman tree.Mature(or older) hangman trees can speak haltingly in the common tongue that they have heard over the years.

                The tree attacks by dropping its noose - like appendages around prey.Although each tree has 1 d4 + 5 appendages, it can control only three at a time.It takes 1 d8 + 12 points of damage to sever and destroy a vine(this is in addition to the damage necessary to kill the tree).When in contact with a victim, the tree inflicts 1 - 3 points of damage per round as the vine tightens and lifts its prey(1, 000 - pound limit) to the upper trunk opening.This requires four rounds.One attempt at a bend bars / lift gates roll can be made to
                break free;
                if the roll fails, the victim cannot escape.On the Sth round, the victim is dropped into the acidic secretion con -
                tained within the barrel of the hangman tree 's trunk. The victim
                suffers 3 d4 points of acid damage per round until dead, and then digestion takes place, Escape from the tree - stomach is impossible,
                due to the many sharp growths that surround the top opening and point down and inward.About three man - sized victims can fit within the tree 's digestive cavity at one time.

                A hangman tree draws power from its environment.It has 5 %
                magic resistance per decade of age, to a maximum of 95 % at age 190. However, it is vulnerable to certain elemental attacks.Light -
                ning that successfully passes its magic resistance inflicts double damage to the tree.Extreme cold shocks the tree into dormancy until it thaws out.Darkness also causes it to slow down its activ -
                ity, although it still functions at half efficiency(three attacks per two rounds).

                A hangman tree has no interest in treasure and, as each moves constantly, it is unlikely that any treasure can be found near one,
                although indigestible items are expelled periodically.

                Mantrap

                This insidious relative of the much smaller Venus flytrap attracts prey by scent, entrapping and dissolving its victims in acidic se -
                cretions.It is a gigantic bush with towering stalks of purple blos -
                soms and huge green leaves at ground level.

                During daylight hours the mantrap releases pollen continu -
                ously, with the resulting effect that all creatures within 60 feet must roll successful saving throws vs.poison or become attracted to the odor.Those attracted proceed to the body of the plant and voluntarily climb into one of the 1 d4 + 1 leaf traps on the plant.Once entered, a leaf trap closes, firmly entrapping the victim(no chance of escape).The victim cannot be pulled free until the plant is destroyed.Its acidic secretions dissolve the victim quickly, in -
                tlicting damage per round equal to the victim 's Armor Class (dis-
                counting Dexterity bonuses), Regardless of the adjusted Armor Class, the victim sustains at least 1 point of damage per round.ltems exposed to the acid must roll saving throws once per round against the eftects; all metal items receive a + 2 bonus.

            The fascination with the mantrap is so strong that, once a being is enthralled, it requires 24 hours
            for the effects of this fragrance to wear off, The fumes from burning the plant counteract the ef -
            fect.Because of its overwhelming effect, the nectar of mantrap flowers is an ingredient in philters of love, though the mantrap is so dangerous that most alchemists would rather use other recipes than risk their lives searching
            for mantraps.

            Strangleweed

            Strangleweed is an intelligent kelp found in relatively warm sea water.A bed of this carnivorous plant is indistinguishable from normal seaweed, This plant grows in an oval with 3 d4 fronds which vary in length between seven and 12 feet, sprouting froma patch of 3 d4 square feet.

            Any creature within the grasp of one or more fronds is at -
            tacked.A hit by the strangleweed indicates that the target has been entwined by the attacking frond.Each frond has 4 d4 Strength points).A victim compares his Strength against the combined Strengths of the fronds that have grabbed him.If the victim is stronger, each point of Strength in his favor gives him a 10 % chance to escape.(Example: a victim with 15 Strength is at -
            tacked by fronds with a collective Strength of 13. The difference in Strengths is 2 points in the victim 's favor, so he has a 20%
            chance to escape).Escape can be attempted each round.Strengths of 18 / 51 through 18 / 00 round up to 19.

        If the fronds are stronger than the victim, then the victim can -
        not escape on his own, and the fronds crush him
        for 1 point of damage per point of Strength difference.(Example: a victim with Strength of 12 is being crushed by fronds with a collective Strength of 28. The victim cannot escape, and the difference in
            Strengths is 16, so the fronds inflict 16 points of damage per round.) Any creature thus entwined attacks with a - 2 penalty to its attack roll.

        Giant Sundew

        Unlike its smaller cousin, this plant is almost sentient.Preferring shaded cool places to grow, the sundew grows only hair - like roots to lightly anchor it in place.It can pull itself slowly on the ground using sticky tendrils.A sundew appears as a three - to four - foot - high mound of grayish green tarry ropes or rags.The air around them is often fly - infested and has a thick odor like sweet syrup.

        The sundew detects moving creatures by vibrations.When anything moves within five feet of it, it lashes out with its tend -
        rils.Its body is covered with hundreds of tendrils, and a maxi -
        mum of six can attack each creature in range in a round.These tendrils end in sticky globs of sap.For every three tendrils that hit a victim, he suffers a cumulative - 1 penalty to his attack roll.Thus
        if a victim has been hit nine times, he has a - 3 penalty to his 1 d20 attack roll.The sap has a mild acid enzyme that continues to inflict 1 point of damage per round
        for each tendril that has suc -
        cessfully grabbed the victim(a successful open doors roll breaks a tendril; check
            for each tendril attached to the victim),

        If a 20 is rolled on the sundew’ s attack roll, it has struck the vic -
        tim’ s mouth and nose, clogging them with sap.Suffocation occurs in 2 - 4 rounds unless the sap is removed.The sap may be dissolved by soaking it with vinegar or alcohol.Due to the plant 's sticky ex-
        terior, missiles and fire - based attacks inflict only half damage.

        Tri - flower Frond

        The deep green stalks of this plant are topped by trumpet - shaped flowers of vivid orange, bright yellow, and intense red(other color combinations are possible).

        Each flower has its own
        function.The orange one shoots 2 d4 pollen - covered tendrils, each three feet long; any creature struck must roll a successful saving
        throw vs.poison or fall into a coma
        for 1 d4 hours.The sensitive rootlets of the yellow blossom tell it where to find the slumbering victim; the yellow bloom bends over and shakes down a shower of sticky enzyme that causes 2 d4 points of damage per round until washed off(damage reduced by 1 point per flask of water; complete immersion in water removes the sap).The red blossom extends tendrils into the victim, drain -
        ing body fluids at a rate of 1 d6 points of damage per round.

        Poltergeists are the spirits of restless dead.They are similar to haunts but are more malevolent.They hate living things and tor -
        ment them constantly, by breaking furniture, throwing heavy ob -
        jects, and making haunting noises.They are often, but not always, attached to a particular area.

        Poltergeists are always invisible.Those who can see invisible objects describe them as humans whose features have been twisted at the sight of horrors.They wear rags and are covered with chains and other heavy objects that represent a multitude of evil deeds that these creatures have committed against themselves as well as others.

        Combat: A poltergeist attacks by throwing a heavy object— any nearby object that a strong human can
        throw will suffice.It
        has the same chance to hit as a 5 - HD monster(hence its adjusted THACO in the statistics given above).If the victim is struck he suffers no damage(treat the use of deadly weapons such as knives and swords as terrifying near misses), but he must roll a success -
        ful saving
        throw vs.spell or flee in terror in a random direction(choose available exits away from the poltergeist and determine randomly) for 2 d12 rounds before recovering.There is a 50 %
            chance that the victim drops whatever he was holding(he drops it at the start of his flight), Once a person rolls a successful saving
        throw, he is immune to further fear attempts by the poltergeist in
        that area.

        Those who
        try to hit a poltergeist but cannot detect invisible objects suffer a - 4 penalty to their attack roll.A poltergeist is harmed only by silver or magical weapons.Sprinkled holy water or a strongly presented holy symbol drives back a poltergeist but cannot harm it.Poltergeists that are bonded to the area of their death are hard to dispel; these are treated as
        if they were ghouls on the Turning Undead table.Wandering poltergeists may be turned or destroyed by a priest as
        if they were skeletons.

        Habitat / Society: Some say that poltergeists are the spirits of those who committed heinous crimes that went unpunished in
        life.Whatever their origins, poltergeists are malevolent spirits whose activities can be anything from annoying to deadly.Their purpose in existence is to haunt and disrupt the lives of those who still live.





        Poltergeists often haunt families and partnerships.In the latter
        case, they haunt their place of business, striking almost as much terror in death as they did in life.

        A poltergeist is often strongly bonded to a particular place, the place where its corporeal existence ended.Bonded poltergeists al -
        most never wander more than 100 feet from this place.A few are wandering spirits, doomed never to find their way home.Bonded spirits are stronger than wandering spirits(wanderers never have more than 3 hit points).

        Places where poltergeists are particularly strong have been known to have phantom shifts.These extremely rare and terrify -
        ing illusions take the character encountering the poltergeist back in time, to the time when the poltergeist was still alive.They often reveal why the being was transformed into a poltergeist.Charac -
        ters in a phantom shift may interact freely with the illusion, but any attempt to harm the illusion shatters it and returns the char -
        acters to the present time; likewise, any attempt on the part of the illusion to attack the characters also shatters the illusion without any harm being done.The illusion may
        continue at different times, or may repeat itself endlessly.No one can predict exactly when a place will experience a phantom shift, but they seem to oc -
        cur on the anniversary of the poltergeist’ s death.

        Ecology:
            These spirits, which are terrifying and pitiable at the same time, do not consume food and do not collect treasure, Pol -
                    tergeists dissolve when slain or laid to rest.

                Porcupines are large rodents native to temperate forested areas.There are many species of porcupines that differ only in minor de -
                tails.Porcupines are timid, panic - prone creatures with one very nasty defense mechanism— stiff, sharp hairs known as quills.

                There are two distinct families of porcupine: black and brown.Brown porcupines are the smaller of the two, about two feet long,
                but with quills that grow up to one foot long.The black porcu -
                pine is between 2!/2 and three feet long with a thick muscular tail,
                but has shorter quills(three inches long).Porcupines weigh be -
                tween 35 and 50 pounds.

                Combat: Contrary to some popular legends, a common(black or brown) porcupine doesn’ t
                throw its quills, but it can readily
                detach them when they strike an enemy.These herbivores do not

                attack unless they feel threatened, and even then only when they cannot safely run away.Porcupines smash an attacker with their tails, dislodging quills.Black porcupines inflict 1 - 3 points of dam -
                age with their barbed quills,
                while the longer quills of the brown porcupines cause 1 d4 points of damage.Creatures that
                try to touch a porcupine automatically suffer damage from their quills.Because of their overlapping barbs, porcupine quills are ex -
                tremely difficult to remove, and cause painful swelling.

                Habitat / Society: Porcupines live in heavily wooded areas.They are excellent tree climbers.They are not anti - social creatures, but seem to prefer a mate and young
                for their only company.

                Ecology: Porcupines feed on the bark and leaves of trees; their appetite has sometimes killed the trees on which they feed.They also feed on fruits and are especially fond of salt.Few creatures attack the porcupine.There are no known potions or spells that use porcupine components,

                Giant Porcupine

                Giant porcupines are larger versions of the common woodland porcupines.They are identical in appearance to their smaller cousins, the brown porcupines, except that the white streaks of their quills are more obvious.They inhabit wooded areas.They are stupid and nonaggressive, but can defend themselves.

                A giant porcupine can bite
                for 2 d4 points of damage, but uses this attack in only the most desperate defense(
                    if it is brought down to less than half its hit points).Its main defense is its ability to shoot 1 d8 quills from its tail, each of which inflicts 1 d4 points of damage.This attack has a range of 30 feet.As its quills are up to three feet long, any attacker that comes within six feet of the gi -
                ant porcupine receives 1 d4 quills from the porcupine’ s defensive movements.There are over 80 quills in its tail and over 300 in its body.

                The giant porcupine views any approach within 30 feet as a threat.If a creature approaches it at that distance, it crouches ina defensive posture and issues a warning hiss, giving the creature one round to leave before it attacks.As with normal porcupines,
                there are no known uses
                for giant porcupine components.

                Looking almost too big to be real, rocs are huge birds of prey that dwell in warm mountainous regions and are known
                for carrying off large animals(cattle, horses, elephants) for food.

                Rocs resemble large eagles, with either dark brown plumage or all golden feathers from head to tail, In a few rare instances, rocs of all red, black or white are sighted, but such sightings are often considered bad omens.These giant birds are 60 feet long from beak to tail feathers, with wingspans as wide as 120 feet.

                Combat: The roc swoops down upon prey, seizes it in powerful talons, and carries it off to the roc’ s lair to be devoured at leisure.The resulting damage is 3 d6 per claw.Most of the time(95 % ), a roc carries off its prey only
                if both claws hit.If the prey was hit by only one claw, the roc usually lets go, then turns around and at -
                tempts another grab.Once the prey has been secured, the roc flies back to its nest.If the creature resists, the roc strikes with its beak, inflicting 4 d6 points of damage per hit.

                Should a human, humanoid, or demihuman be captured, there is a 65 % chance that the victim’ s arms are both pinned to his sides, making impossible melee weapon attacks or spellcasting that requires hand gestures.A roc will
                let go of its prey
                if it suffers damage equal to a quarter of its hit points.A roc can pick up two targets simultaneously
                if they are within 10 feet of each other,

                A roc usually cruises at a height of about 300 feet, seeking out likely prey with its sharp eyes.When a good target is found, it swoops down silently.The stealth of this first attack imposes a - 5 penalty to its opponents’ surprise rolls.

                Habitat / Society: Roc lairs are vast nests made of trees,
                branches, and the like.They inhabit the highest mountains in
                warm regions, Rocs are not given to nesting close to each other,
                with a nest rarely being located within 20 miles of another nest.There is a 15 % chance of finding 1 d4 + 1 eggs in a roc nest.These eggs sell
                for 2 d6 x 100 gp to merchants specializing in exotic items.As may be expected, rocs fight to the death to protect these nests and their contents, gaining a + 1 bonus to their attack roll.

                The treasure of a roc is usually strewn about and below the nest,
                for the creature does not value such.It is the residue from its victims.If the roc has been seizing pack horses and mules, some of that treasure may be merchant 's wares such as spices, rugs, tap-

                estries, perfume, rich clothing, or jewels.

                The roc ranges
                for food three times a day; about an hour after sunrise, at noon, and an hour before sunset.If there are young in
                the nest, a fourth feeding, approximately two hours after noon, is added to keep the young strong and well - fed.

                Ecology: Rocs are occasionally tamed and used by cloud or storm giants.Good - aligned giants do not allow their rocs to at -
                    tack civilized areas and the animals therein.

                As mentioned before, rocs do not nest too closely together,
                    since such a high concentration of these hungry predators would
                deprive entire regions of its animal population.Rocs serve to keep down the number of large predators, as they are fond of ankheg, purple worms, and harpies.Thanks to the rocs’ prodi -
                gious appetites, these creatures are not swarming about with im -
                punity.

                It is said that roc feathers can be used in the manufacture of Quaal’ s feather tokens, as well as wings and brooms of flying.

                One race that has little love
                for rocs is dwarves.Dwarven mines located in remote mountains often have to contend with unruly rocs intent on protecting their territory.Attempts by the dwarves to tame rocs have all met with failure, so the accepted manner of dealing with rocs is to kill them and smash their eggs.Adventurers who happen on a community of mountain dwarves may find employment as roc hunters.Such groups would do well
                not to allow any druids to find this out.

                Ropers are subterranean creatures with the capacity of camou -
                flage coupled with high intelligence.These aggressive carnivores are terrifying to behold and very magic resistant.

                Their hides are yellowish gray and rough.Combined with their pillar - like shape, this makes them resemble stalagmites when up -
                right and boulders when lying down.Heat does not conduct well through a roper 's hide, so infravision is useless in trying to spot
                these creatures.They are nine feet long and have a base of about three feet wide.Halfway up the roper 's body are six sticky rope-
                like strands of great strength that it can shoot 1 d4 + 1 x 10 feet away, at the rate of one per round, These strands blend in with the rest of the roper’ s body.The roper has a single yellow eye, plus a maw ringed with sharp teeth.

                Combat: Ropers attack by shooting their strands and drawing in snared victims to be bitten.Each time a strand from a living roper successfully hits, the victim must roll a successful saving
                throw vs.poison or lose 50 % of its Strength(round fractions down) within 1 - 3 rounds.If a victim cannot
                break free from a strand, then he is pulled ten feet closer to the roper 's maw each
                round until he breaks free or is bitten.A strand can be broken by yanking it off(equal to the character 's chance to open doors) or
                    by cutting it with a single blow from an edged weapon
                    for 6 points of damage.The strands share the roper’ s AC of 0. The Strength loss lasts
                    for 2 d4 turns.

                    When a roper draws a victim into its maw, it then bites, auto -
                    matically hitting
                    for 5 d4 points of damage.

                    Ropers are unaffected by lightning and suffer half damage from cold - based attacks, but fire - based attacks are saved against witha -

                    Habitat / Society: Scholars with nothing better to do have de -
                        bated exactly what to call a group of ropers.Thus far, “cluster”
                    seems to be the favored term.Ropers dwell in subterranean ca -
                    verns and can stand upright to resemble a stalagmite or lie down on the ground to imitate a boulder.Some can even flatten them -
                    selves, looking much like a lump on a cavern floor.They have limited chameleon abilities that enable them to blend so well into a cave that it is hard to tell where the roper begins and the cave floor ends.











                    Ropers are not social creatures, rarely cooperating with each other.They reproduce asexually, with a roper merely shedding some of its matter, much like planting a seed.Drawing mineral nutrients from the underground cavern(and perhaps even si -
                        phoning magical energies from deep within the earth), the roper grows to maturity very quickly, in a matter of 2 d4 weeks.

                    Though they have massive cilia - like appendages on their un -
                    dersides, ropers seldom range outside their caverns.These cilia enable them to cling to walls and ceilings.Though ropers eat any -
                    thing, they favor human and demihuman.Gnomes and dwarves,
                    the races that do extensive mining, harbor an especially strong
                    dread
                    for these things.

                    Sometimes, when the pickings in a particular network of caves have grown slim, a roper will migrate to another feeding ground,
                    taking the treasure of its past victims.The migration is accom -
                    plished via underground tunnels whenever possible.When not possible, ropers travel in a pack in the dead of night, giving rise to some legends of walking stones.

                    Ropers have a gizzard - like organ that often holds treasure, usu -
                    ally undigested baubles.Platinum seems to be immune to the rop -

                    plus a 35 % chance of 5 d4 gems.

                    Ecology: Ropers seem to serve no good purpose, though some alchemists prize the glue from the strands or the digestive juices
                    for their acidic ability.The latter should be contained in a plati -

                    Rot grubs are disgusting little creatures that resemble maggots.They would be considered inconsequential
                    if not
                    for their horrify -
                    ing attack form.

                    Rot grubs’ color ranges from maggot white to dung brown.They are differentiated from maggots by the two tiny antennae nubs on their heads.Their size ranges from 1 / 2 inch to two inches long, with some unusual specimens getting as long as three inches.Most of the time(75 % ), rot grubs are mistaken
                    for regular worms or maggots.

                    Combat: These small creatures will viciously burrow into any living flesh that touches them,
                    for they greatly enjoy such fare to dine upon.The attack is automatically successful— no attack roll is necessary provided they have been touched by bare skin.If there is any question of whether or not bare skin has been exposed to arot grub, multiply the would - be victim 's Armor Class by 10,
                    not counting shields.This is the chance, rolled on percentile dice,
                    that the rot grubs are touching bare skin.

                    The victim must immediately apply flame to the wound(1 d6 points of damage per application) or have a cure disease spell cast upon him.Flame kills 2 d10 grubs per application,
                    while a cure disease kills all of them.Unless these measures are taken, the rot grubs burrow to their host 's heart and kill him in 1-3 turns.

                    The most insidious aspect of the rot grubs is the anesthetic se -
                    cretions that they use on their victims.Often this dulls the bur -
                    rowed area, making the victim completely unaware that he has been invaded.Victims should roll Wisdom checks on 1 d20 in or -
                    der to realize that something is gravely wrong.This roll can be made every round, but time is of the essence!Within 1 d6 rounds,
                    the rot grubs are deep enough that they cannot be affected by the flames.

                    Habitat / Society: Rot grub swarms are occasionally found in
                    heaps of offal or dung.They are seldom found in ceilings, floors,
                    or walls, but it is possible.Sometimes, undead such as ghouls,
                    ghasts, zombies, or wights carry rot grubs, though the little beasts have no effect on these undead hosts.In jungle and swamp areas, rot grubs can be found in heaps of rotting plants.Anyone who is so foolish as to walk barefoot in such areas gets what he deserves!











                    Once the host is dead, rot grubs use the corpse as a nesting place
                    for their eggs.These creatures lack both treasure and the in -
                    tellect to collect treasure.Still, on a rare(1 % ) chance, rot grubs are encountered
                    while still inside a recently killed victim.In such rare cases, the chance of treasure is handled under treasure types I, K, L, and M.

                    As mentioned earlier, rot grubs are fond of living flesh, though they have been known to eat dead flesh, plants, and other things best left not mentioned.Still,
                    if they have a choice, they will al -
                    ways choose living tissue.

                    Ecology: Rot grubs are often sought by assassins.Placing one or two of these on a sleeping victim usually ensures a quick, quiet death.Furthermore, unless a physician knows what to look
                    for,
                    the cause of death cannot be determined.

                    Giant ants, centipedes, spiders include rot grubs in their diet.What is worse, however, is that certain subterranean races such as illithids, kuo - toa, trolls, and troglodytes savor rot grubs as del -
                    icacies, eating them much the same as one would eat meal worms.

                    Alchemists have tried to devise a means of extracting the juices from rot grubs in hopes of coming up with a workable anesthetic.Thus far all attempts have been unsuccessful.There are rumors that rot grubs are used as material components in certain harm -
                    causing spells, usually the reverse versions of healing and restor -
                    ative spells.

                    Rust monsters are subterranean creatures with an appetite

                    sive, are the bane of fighters everywhere.

                    The average rust monster measures five feet long and three feet high at the shoulder.It has a strange tail that appears armor plated and ends in an odd - looking bony projection that resembles a double - ended paddle.Two prehensile antennae are located un -

                    2 weapon or armor has a 20 % chance of not being affected).Any affected metal rusts or corrodes and immediately falls to pieces that are easily eaten and digested by the creature.Metal weapons striking a rust monster are affected just as

                for purposes of determining whether or not it breaks up.

                Rust monsters, being none too bright, stop pursuing a fleeing party
                for one round to devour metallic items, such as a handful of iron spikes, a mace or a hammer,
                if the party throws them behind.Rust monsters go after ferrous metals such as iron, steel, and magical steel alloys, such as mithril and adamantite.They choose such metals over valuable metals such as copper, gold, silver, or platinum.In fact, they would
                continue to pursue a party that just dropped a fistful of copper coins,
                for example, in hopes of getting the much - preferred ferrous metal of armor and weapons.

                Sometimes(30 % chance), a rust monster will even pause
                for one round during combat in order to eat.Rust monsters are not known
                for being tacticians, just ravenously hungry metal - eaters.Feeding time always takes one round regardless of the size of the metal meal.











                Habitat / Society: Rust monsters dwell only in dark, subterra -
                nean places such as caverns and underground structures.They are not disposed to groups; often a lair comprises one or two rust monsters, with a 5 % chance of encountering a single offspring,
                which acts as a half - strength rust monster with a full - strength ap -
                petite, These creatures have been known to range the length and breadth of an underground complex, searching
                for supplies of metal.Though it will eat raw ore, a rust monster always prefers the refined, forged metal(just as a human would prefer fresh, fil -
                    tered water over swamp water).

                The creature 's relatively inoffensive nature makes it an unlikely
                target.There have been many accounts of mages approaching a rust monster and the only reaction from the beast was a cursory sniff, then a leisurely departure.Dwarves and gnomes, known
                for metalworking and mining, have no sympathy
                for rust mon -
                sters, and will do anything to get rid of them.

                The only treasure to be found in a rust monster lair is gems,
                usually the sort used
                for decoration on armor or sword pommels.Rust monsters have no grand designs, only the wish to keep well -

                fed.

                Ecology: Rust monsters help in removing metallic junk and clutter from underground fastnesses.In fact, it is not unusual to find a rust monster and a carrion crawler working in a symbiotic relationship, with the latter eating the organic litter and the former consuming the metal castoffs.

                    Typical sahuagins are blackish green on their backs, shading to green on their bellies, with black fins.Their great, staring eyes are deep, shining black.They have scaly skin, with webbed fingers and toes, and their mouths are filled with sharp fangs.About one in 216 sahuagin is a mutation with four usable arms.These speci -
                    mens are usually black shading to gray.Females are indistinguish -
                    able from males, except that they are slightly smaller.Hatchlings are a light green color, but they darken and attain full growth ap -
                    proximately one to two months after hatching.

                    Sahuagin speak their own tongue.

                    Combat: Though they wear no armor, their scales are tough and equal to AC 5, Sahuagin wear a harness to carry their per -
                    sonal gear and weapons.A group of these creatures is typically armed as follows:

                    Spear & dagger 30 %
                    Trident, net & dagger 50 %
                    Heavy crossbow & dagger 20 %

                    Spears are used only as thrusting weapons.Nets are set with dozens of hooks that make escape from one virtually impossible
                    for unarmored victims or creatures not able to grasp and tear with a Strength of 16 or greater.Nets are replaced by three jave -
                    lins when the band forays onto land.The crossbows fire a maxi -
                    mum of 30 feet underwater and normal ranges on the surface.Tridents have three uses— to spear small prey, to pin prey trapped in nets, and to hold threatening opponents at bay.

                    Sahuagin are well - equipped to attack even without weapons,
                    for their webbed hands each end in long, sharp claws that can in -
                    flict 1 - 2 points of damage per attack.Their powerful rear legs are likewise taloned, and
                    if they kick an opponent with them, they in -
                    flict 1 d4 points of damage with each hit from either foot.The sharp teeth of the sahuagin cause 1 d4 points of damage
                    if a bite is scored on a victim.Thus, it is possible
                    for an unarmed sahuagin

                to attack three or five times in a melee round causing 1 - 2 / 1 - 2 / 1 - 4 and an extra 1 - 4 / 1 - 4
                if the legs can rake.

                The eyes and ears of these monsters are particularly keen.They can see
                for 300 feet underwater at depths of up to 100 feet.For each 100 feet of greater depth, their vision is reduced by ten feet(e.g., when 500 feet deep they can see 260 feet; when 1, 000 feet deep they can see 210 feet), Their ears are so sharp as to be able to detect the clinking of metal at one mile, or a boat oar splashing at twice that distance.

                A band of sahuagin is always led by a chieftain.He has one lieutenant
                for every ten members of the group.The chieftain has 4 + 4 Hit Dice, and his lieutenants have 3 + 3 Hit Dice.All are in
                addition to the normal sahuagin in the group.

                When raiding villages, sahuagin attack en masse, with leaders in the second rank.As long as there is no truly spirited resistance,
                they
                continue in their plunder and violence.

                Underwater, in their natural element, the sahuagin are far more confident.Using the three - dimensional aspect of underwater fighting, they sometimes dive down on a group of underwater ex -
                plorers, coming in from behind, and swooping down and past them, dropping nets on their intended victims.

                When sahuagin attack ships, they swarm up from all sides and
                try to overwhelm with numbers.They often grab their opponents and hurl them into the sea, where at least a fourth of the raiding party lurks, waiting
                for such an action or as reinforcements.Some leaders carry a conch shell, which when sounded gives the signal
                for the group of sahuagin in reserve to enter the fray.

                Sahuagin have an almost paralyzing fear of spellcasters.They direct their strongest attacks toward anyone who uses spells or spell - like powers, such as the functions of some magical items.Their saving throws vs.fire - based spells suffer a - 2 penalty, and they receive an additional point of damage per die of damage from such attacks.

                Habitat / Society: The sahuagin are sometimes referred to as“ sea devils” or“ devil men of the deep.”They dwell in warm salt waters at depths of 100 to 1, 500 feet.Sahuagin are predatory in the ex -
                treme, and they pose a threat to all living things because they kill
                for sport and pleasure as well as
                for food.They abhor fresh water.They dislike light, and bright light such as that created by a con - Sahuagin

                tinual light spell is harmful to their eyes.

                The social structure of the sahuagin is based upon rule by a king who holds court in a vast city deep beneath the waves.This overlord’ s domain is divided into nine provinces, each ruled by a prince.Each prince has 2 d10 + 10 nobles underneath him.Each noble controls the small groups of sahuagin dwelling in his fief.The sahuagin worship a great devil - shark.Sahuagin priests above 5 th level are very rare.

                The king is supposed to dwell in a city somewhere at the great -
                est depth that a sahuagin can exist.This place is supposedly built in an undersea canyon, with palaces and dwellings built along ei -
                ther face.There, fully 5, 000 of these monsters live, not counting the king 's retinue of queens, concubines, nobles, guards, etc., said
                to number 1, 000 or more.The sahuagin king is reported to be of enormous size(10 Hit Dice + 10 hit points), and of greatest evil.The king is always accompanied by nine noble guards(9 + 9 Hit Dice) and the evil high priestess of all sahuagin(9 + 9 Hit Dice) with its retinue of nine underpriestesses(7 th - level clerics).

                If sahuagin are encountered in their lair, there are the following additional sahuagin:

                1 baron(6 + 6 Hit Dice)

                Nine guards(3 + 3 Hit Dice) 3 d4 x 10 females(2 Hit Dice) 1 d4 x 10 hatchlings(1 Hit Die) 2 d4 x 10 eggs

                Also, there is a 10 % chance per 10 male sahuagin that there are an evil priestess and 1 d4 assistant priestesses,
                for the religious life of these creatures is dominated by the females.If a priestess is with the group in the lair, it is of 1 d4 + 1 level ability, and the lesser cler -
                ics are 3 rd or 4 th level.

                There are always 2 d4 sharks in a sahuagin lair.Sahuagin are a!le to make these monsters obey simple one - or two - word com -
                mands.Whenever a sahuagin lair is encountered, there is a 5 %
                chance that it is the stronghold of a prince.The prince has 8 + 8 Hit Dice plus nine guards of chieftain strength.There are also one 8 th - level sahuagin evil high priestess and four 4 th - level unde -
                rpriestesses.The numbers of males, females, hatchlings and eggs in a prince 's lair are double the numbers given above. There are
                4 d6 sharks present at all times.

                Sahuagin lairs are actual villages or towns, constructed of stone.The buildings are domed, and the seaweed and similar ma -
                rine plants growing around and on these buildings make them hard to detect.

                Few persons have survived capture by the sahuagin,
                for pris -
                oners are usually quickly tortured and eaten.Any creatures taken alive from raids or intercepting unwelcome visitors are brought to the sahuagins’ lair and confined in cells.Although sahuagin are able to stay out of water
                for up to four hours, there is no air in the confinement areas in the typical village, but in the towns of the nobles there are special quarters to maintain air - breathing crea -
                tures.The sahuagin set aside a few prisoners to torture and pro -
                vide sport— typically a fight to the death between two different creatures in an arena.The bulk of captives are simply killed and eaten.It is seldom that any prisoner escapes, although the sa -
                huagin find sport in allowing captives to think that they have found freedom, only to be encircled by sadistic guards
                while a school of sharks moves in
                for the kill.

                The sahuagin are crue!and brutal, and the strongest always

                bully the weaker.Any injured, disabled, or infirm specimen is slain and eat @m by these cannibalistic monsters.Even imperfect hatchlings are dealt with in this fashion.This strict law has devel -
                oped a strong race, however, and any leader is subject to a chal -
                lenge.Sahuagin never stop growing, although they grow very slowly, and death comes to most before the years allow growth to large size.Leaders are always the largest and strongest.It is re -
                ported that the nine sahuagin princes are each of the four - armed sort, as is the king.In any event, the loser of a challenge is always slain, either during on combat or afterward.Sometimes the loser winds up as the main course at the victory feast.

                Duels are fought without weapons, only fang and claw being permitted.

                The sahuagin are chronicled because of their great evil, having time and again raided the land, desolating whole coasts, and de -
                stroying passing ships continually.The exact origin of the sa -
                huagin is unknown.It is suggested that they were created from a nation of particularly evil humans by the most powerful lawful evil gods in order to preserve them when the great deluge came upon the earth.Some sages claim that they are degenerate hu -
                mans who formerly dwelt on the seacoasts, whose evil and de -
                pravity was so great that they eventually devolved into fish - folk and sought the darkness of the ocean depths.The tritons how -
                ever, are purported to have stated that sahuagin are distantly re -
                lated to sea elves, claiming that the drow spawned the sahuagin.

                Sahuagin range as far as 50 miles from their lairs.Most of their lairs are located 2 d10 + 20 miles from coastal shores.Some of these creatures enjoy collecting pearls and coral formations, fash -
                ioning them into jewelry.This jewelry is worn as a status symbol.They are fond of wealth, which they use as a measure of influ -
                ence, and
                for sacrifice to the deities that they worship in exchange
                for granted powers and other favors.Most of the treasure found in a sahuagin lair belonged to former victims.There is usually a high concentration of water - related items, such as magical boats,
                tridents, helms, potions, necklaces, etc.These were gained from adventurers who explored underwater too closely to the sahuagin community.

                These creatures want nothing less than full control of the sea coasts, collecting as much wealth and power as possible in the process
                while maintaining the secrecy of their lairs’ locations.Those who attempt escape are obsessively hunted down,
                for fear that the former prisoners may reveal the location of the sa -
                huagins '’ city.

                Ecology: Sahuagin venture ashore on dark, moonless nights to raid and plunder human coastal towns.They hate even the evil ixitxachitl, and only sharks are befriended by them.

                The feuds and outright warfare between the sahuagin and ixit -
                xachitl have indirectly contributed to preventing the ascendancy of the spellcasting, manta ray - like race.Sahuagin are also fond of eating giant squid and kraken.Their hunting of these monsters of the deep has kept the squid and kraken numbers down to a safe level.Conversely, these beasts enjoy eating sahuagin, which pre -
                vents the sahuagin from overrunning coastal areas.

                Of all the sea - dwelling races, tritons, sea elves, dolphins, and hippocampi are the most implacable enemies of the sahuagin.In fact, the few air - breathers that have escaped the sahuagin owe their freedom to such beings that bravely aided the captives.

                2, 000 120

                Salamanders are natives of the elemental plane of Fire, and thus they thrive in hot places.These cruel, evil creatures come to the Prime Material plane
                for reasons known only to them.

                The head and torso of a salamander is copper - colored and has a human - like appearance.Most of the time(80 % ), this aspect is a male, with flaming beard and moustache.The female version has flowing, fiery red hair.Both aspects have glowing yellow eyes that sometimes
                switch to fluorescent green.All aspects carry a shiny metal spear, resembling highly polished steel.

                The lower torso is that of a large snake, with orange coloring shading to dull red at the tail end.The entire body is covered with wispy appendages that appear to burn but are never consumed.

                Combat: A salamander typically attacks with its metal spear,
                which inflicts 1 d6 points of damage plus a like amount
                for the spear’ s heat.At the same time, it can lash out and coil around an opponent with its snake - like tail, constricting
                for 2 d6 points of damage, plus an additional 1 d6 points of damage from the heat of its body.While fire - resistant creatures do not suffer from the sala -
                    mander 's heat damage, they are still subject to the spear and con-
                striction damage.

                Salamanders can be affected only by magical weaponry or by creatures of a magical nature or those of 4 + 1 or more Hit Dice.They are impervious to all fire - based attacks.Sleep, charm, and hold spells are ineffective against them.Cold - based attacks cause an additional 1 point of damage per die of damage.The head and upper body of the salamander has an AC of 5,
                while the lower body is AC 3.

                A favorite salamander tactic,
                if the creature is encountered in a lava pit or roaring fire, is to grab its opponents and hurl them into the flames.The victim would naturally take damage from contact with the salamander, then take even more from being thrown in -
                side a roaring conflagration.

                Habitat / Society: Salamanders are native to the elemental plane of Fire.They come to the Prime Material plane
                for reasons known only to them, though it is rumored that powerful wizards and priests of certain religions can summon them
                for a short time, Sal -
                amanders hate cold, preferring temperatures of 300 degrees or more; they can abide lower temperatures
                for only a few hours.














                Their lairs are typically at least 500 degrees.Any treasure found there is the sort that can survive this heat, such as swords, armor,
                rods, other ferrous items, and jewels.Things of a combustible na -
                ture, such as parchment and wood, soft metals such as gold and silver, and liquids, which quickly boil away, are never found in
                salamander lairs.

                Having a nasty disposition and an evil bent, salamanders re -
                spect only power, either the ability to resist their fire or the capa -
                bility to do great damage.Anyone
                else is dealt a painful, slow,
                    burning death.It is rumored that they have some sort of dealings
                with the efreeti.

                When encountered on the Prime plane, salamanders can be found playing in forest fires, lava flows, fire pits, and other areas of extreme heat.They usually appear on the Prime plane
                for a purpose, and
                if inthe middle of a task they do not take kindly to
                being interrupted.

                Ecology: These fiery creatures’ ichor is useful in the creation of potions of fire resistance, and the metal of their spears can be used to create rings of fire resistance.

                Fire Snake

                Some sages say that fire snakes are larval salamanders.Fire snakes, colored in shades from blood - red to orange, are always found in fires.Some large permanent fires contain 1 d6 of these creatures, though in smaller, temporary fires like fire pits and oil bowls, there may be but one snake.The only treasure the snakes have is the gems they often accumulate.

                Since their color matches their surroundings, they can surprise opponents easily(-4 penalty to opponents’ surprise rolls).Their bite inflicts 1 d4 points of damage and injects a mild venom that causes paralyzation of the victim
                for 2 d4 turns unless a saving
                throw vs.poison is successful.

                    XP VALUE:

                    A solitary and non - carbon based life form, sandlings seem con -
                    tent to eat and guard their territory.Not aggressive unless pro -
                    voked, sandlings are hard to see and consequently easy
                    for some hapless adventurer to provoke.

                    Sandlings appear to be an amorphous mass of moving, sliding sand capable of creating color variances in order to blend in bet -
                    ter with their background.

                    Combat: These odd creatures are savagely territorial and attack any beings that trespass in their areas.They fight by slashing and lacerating with a coarse, abrasive pseudopod, Sandlings’ flexible,
                    shifting forms are difficult to damage by physical assault, thus the AC of 3. If a sufficient quantity of water or other liquid, at least ten gallons, is cast upon the creature, it will have the same effects as a slow spell and the sandling strikes
                    for only one - half damage(1 d8),

                    If a sandling is stepped on, it lunges upward, trapping one or two man - sized opponents much like a trapper.It is not so much a deliberate attack as it is a reflex.When this happens, the san -
                    dling’ s unexpected attack imposes a - 2 penalty to opponents’ sur -
                    prise rolls.

                    Sandlings sense heat, sound, and moisture, They dislike wet -
                    ness and burrow underground to avoid rain or water unless al -
                    ready defending their territories.They are always the same temperature as their surroundings and thus invisible to infra -
                    vision.Due to their bizarre physical makeup, they are immune to sleep, charm, hold, and other mind - influencing spells.

                    Habitat / Society: Sandlings have no society as we know it.They are a solitary race.Their fanatical defense of their turf precludes even the possibility of cooperating with others of their kind.They are apparently silicon - based creatures, and some sages believe that they originated on the elemental!plane of Earth.They subsist on rocks, sand, and minerals, contrary to the rumors of overly melodramatic storytellers.In fact, they despise organic matter and, upon killing an intruder, move about one - quarter mile away from the battle site.This explains the lack of treasure in their lairs, Most of the victims’ possessions sink down into the soft sand, forced down by the bulk of the sandlings.Unfortunately,
                    sandlings also eat gems.











                    A sandling grows until it reaches full size(ten feet in diameter),
                    and then it begins to reproduce by budding.Tiny sandlings grow to about two inches in diameter before they split from the parent.An adult sandling 's territory often swarms with thousands of in-
                    fant sandlings, none larger than six inches in diameter.When one grows above this size, the parent sandling perceives it as a threat and kills it.When the parent sandling dies, the largest infant grows to take its place, killing all rivals,
                    if it can, A group of san -
                    dling infants grouped together form an uneven surface and may trip an unwary creature.

                    There have been reports of huge sandlings three times as large as normal adults, but these reports have not been substantiated.If any such specimens are ever found, they are likely to actually have two pseudopods to fight with rather than one.

                    As mentioned earlier, an adult sandling is a solitary creature, It dwells in lonely sandy areas such as uninhabited deserts, caverns,

                    dlings live to eat minerals, reproduce, and defend their territories.

                    Ecology: Sandlings are outside factors in ecosystems.They take a small fraction of the minerals in any given parcel of land and are completely inoffensive.Sometimes, dwarven mining clans seek out a sandling’ s haunts to see
                    if it has unearthed any new mineral deposits.

                    Some individuals kill sandlings and use the bodies as ingredi -
                    ents in mortar.Their bodies are rumored to have truly remark -
                    able adhesive abilities.Druids who discover a building that is being held together by sandlings may very well hurl spells at it, in
                    hopes of destroying it.

                    Giant sea horses are simply a huge species of the more common sea horse.They have the characteristic horse - like heads and ta -
                    pering tails of all sea horses,

                    Combat: A sea horse can normally attack only with a head butt, but a sea horse trained by locathah or aquatic elves as a steed can also use its long, curling tail to constrict and restrain en -
                    emies.The sea horse must be ridden in order to properly obey the command to constrict and then must make a successful attack rol].A captured opponent can free itself with a successful open doors roll, with a - 1 penalty.The tail of a giant sea horse is so long that it can attack the same opponent that the head butts, or the one its rider is attacking, without penalty.The length of the tail also constricts the entire body of any creature man - sized or smaller, making spellcasting or melee fighting impossible
                for con -
                stricted creatures.The constriction causes no damage, but the sea horse can still choose to butt the helpless victim
                if so desired.

                Note that underwater combat is three - dimensional and sea horses instinctively use this advantage against creatures that are obviously out of their environment, like men.Sea horse riders take great pains to develop this instinct in their mounts and take advantage of their sea horses’ ability to move vertically as well as forward and back and from side to side, Treat sea horses in water as Maneuverability Class A flying creatures in air.

                All sea horses have 120 - foot infravision and acute senses; it is a foolish rider who fails to take notice of his sea horse mount 's
                warnings.

                Habitat / Society: In their natural environment, sea horses con -
                gregate in schools, feeding off small plankton and seaweed.They have school leaders and follow the prevailing currents.They are generally shy and avoid contact except with other sea horses.

                Sea horses can be found in any marine setting except the coldest arctic depths.They preter tropical to subtropical depths as these provide the greatest variety of foods

                Sea horses are not the brightest of beasts and can be lured into traps and cages
                if the bait is attractive enough.Aquatic elves and locathah have honed the activity of capturing sea horses to a fine art and acquire all the sea horses they need.



                Ecology: Sea horses are preyed upon by the usual assortment of ocean - based predators, namely sharks, giant squids, and a kra -
                ken or two, They only have one special predator, the vicious sa -
                huagin.Unfortunately
                for sea horses, sahuagin will eat anything at least once and they found that giant sea horses were indeed a great delicacy.A small and profitable industry in every sahuagin city is the market guild, and the greatest commodity is sea horse flesh.Many noble houses specialize in hunting down and herding up these peaceful creatures.Sahuagin choose not to cultivate sea horses as they believe the open ocean makes the horses tougher and tastier.

                Fortunately
                for the species, sea horses mate all the time and like most fish they grow very rapidly.There is little chance of sending the sea horse population to extinction.For now at least, they re -
                main one of the larger members of the food chain and valued
                for defense and prestige in both the locathah and aquatic elven com -
                munities

                Rumors of a smaller, freshwater species of giant sea horse re main uncontirmed and the tales of gargantuan sea horses over 60 feet in length have been decisively discounted by most reputable marine authorities.However, only the races that live below the sea can say
                for certain what mysteries yet remain to someday be discovered by men.Sea Lion

                A sea lion is a fearsome creature with the head and forepaws of a lion and the body and tail of a fish.

                Combat: Sea lions are ferocious and difficult to deal with, They are very territorial and usually attack anything that enters their domains, no matter what the size.Their vicious teeth and huge paws are a match even
                for most sharks, which they hate above all other creatures.Sea lions must attack the same opponent with paws and teeth and cannot divide attacks.Any creature hit by both paw attacks in the same round is being mauled.Mauled creatures cannot attack
                if they have not already done so that round and must roll a successful open doors rol] to free them -
            selves, When mauling a creature, the lion follows up with a bite attack witha + 4 bonus to the attack roll, causing double damage
            if successful.

            The head of a sea lion, with its thick mane, is treated as AC 5,
            while the rest of its scaly body is AC 3.

            Sea lions are very difficult to raise in captivity, but can become the best and most loyal of steeds.In fact, they are arguably the most powerful mountable creature beneath the waves.They are very useful as guarding and hunting beasts, since their tremen -
            dous roars can be heard
            for up to ten miles underwater, providing ample time to prepare
            for an attack or to send help, They are not as skillful swimmers as are sea horses— they are the underwater equivalents of Maneuverability Class B creatures.

            Habitat / Society: Sea horses and sea lions almost never encoun -
            ter one another as sea lions prefer to dwell in the shallow coastal regions,
            while sea horses delve the deeps.This is primarily due to their respective dietary differences.Sea horses eat plankton,
            while sea lions eat any type of meat, be it a fish, dinosaur, or wan -
            dering herd animal caught drinking at the water 's edge. Sea lions
            are not afraid of land and it is not unheard of
            for sea lions to drag themselves a few dozen yards up the beach in search of meals.While these attacks are rare indeed, the reports of sea lions in the vicinity does tend to foster more fear among the general populace than a simple shark attack does.But in a world of krakens, dino -
            saurs, and vampires, sea lions are a relatively minor threat.

            Sea lions roam the seas in packs, what might be called a pride of lions on land.The strongest one(usually with maximum hit















                points) is the leader.In a sea lion pack, both sexes hunt and care
            for young, but the males are superior hunters, something that dif -
            ferentiates them from their land - based cousins.

            While sea lions rarely travel anywhere with specific goals in
            mind, they do sometimes team up to aid other packs of lions, usu -
                ally when they roam close enough to hear the collective bellowing
            of their comrades.But territoriality comes into play immediately after the kill is made, and rarely does the reigning leader allow the helpful newcomers to share in the spoils of the victory.Often a new battle
            for power ensues between the two leaders.If the resi -
            dent leader wins, the newcomers leave without a taste of meat.If the newcomer wins, he and his pack remain just long enough to take first choice of flesh, and then depart
            for home.The remain -
            ing leader, vanquished and weakened before his peers, rarely lives long enough to enjoy the spoils.

            Ecology: Sea lions hate sharks, often going to great lengths to hunt them down.The taste of sharks is apparently abhorrent to sea lions and they always leave the carcass uneaten, so it is some -
            thing of a mystery why this rivalry exists.Some sages claim that it is the result of conflicts between the lesser deities of nature, but it is more likely two strong predators vying
            for supremacy of the seas,

            Because of the water - proofing qualities of their thick scales, sea lions can remain out of water
            for up to 24 hours before their gills dry out and become incapable of removing oxygen from the wa -
            ter.If a sea lion is fed a constant source of water into its mouth, it can survive
            for an entire week before disease enters the cracking scales and starvation takes its toll.It is theoretically possible to keep a sea lion in captivity but, like most aquatic carnivores, the restriction of space is often psychologically too much
            for the crea -
            ture and death slowly takes the once - proud beast.

                Shambling mounds, or“ shamblers, ”appear as heaps of rotting vegetation.They are actually an intelligent form of vegetable life,
                roughly humanoid shaped, with a height of six to nine feet and a girth of about six feet at their base(legs to waist) and two feet at their summit(the“ head”).

                Combat: Shambling mounds are fearless attackers and are per -
                haps the most deadly form of plant life known.Their huge arm -
                like appendages inflict 2 - 16 points of crushing damage each time they hit, and an unlucky victim hit by both arms in the same round is entangled in the slimy vines and rotting vegetable matter of the creature.Entangled creatures suffocate in slime in 2 d4 rounds unless the shambler is killed or the victim breaks free(ona successful bend bars / lift gates roll).

                The shambler 's powerful attacks are supported by a combina-
                tion of defenses that make shambling mounds invulnerable to most normal attacks.The vast amounts of thick vegetation cov -
                ering the important inner body protect the shambling mound very well, thus its AC of 0. All edged and pointed weapons that strike the shambling mound successfully cause only one - half damage since the blows are greatly weakened as they pass through layer upon layer of cellulose fibers and slime.Since shamblers can collapse themselves at will, crushing weapons in -
                flict no damage at all upon them.

                Fire - based attacks are ineffective against the wet and slimy shambling mounds, and cold - based attacks cause only one - half(
                    if saving
                    throw is failed) or no damage(
                    if saving
                    throw succeeds) to the creatures, due to their essentially vegetable nature.Light -
                ning actually causes a shambling mound to grow in size
                if used against it(add one foot in height, 1 Hit Die, and appropriate hit points
                    for each lightning - based attack it is subjected to).

                Spells that normally affect plants are effective against sham -
                bling mounds, Spells such as plant control and charm plant have proven the most successful so far.

                Shambling mounds often lie in shallow bogs waiting
                for hap -
                less creatures to walk on top of them, The usually surprised be -
                ings(-3 penalty to their surprise rolls) are struck and smothered,









                often before they can even call
                for help.

                Shambling mounds are almost totally silent and invisible in
                their natural surroundings(-3 penalty to opponents’ surprise rolls), They are not above creeping slowly into the camps of un -
                suspecting travelers at night, They are excellent swimmers as well.

                Habitat / Society; Shambling mounds are only found in regions of dense rainfall and vegetation.Dismal swamps, marshes, and rain forests are their favorite climes, but some wet subterranean places also serve as shambler lairs.They are solitary beasts, only rarely living in the same area as other shamblers— usually only in
                areas where the food source is constant(e.z., near famous ruins or abandoned gold mines, etc.).

                Ecology: The shambling mound is an animate clump of vegeta -
                tion with a small brain - like control center located deep within the“ chest” cavity.Decapitating a shambling mound, therefore, does not harm it in the least.Since a shambling mound’ s“ limbs” are merely aggregated clumps of vine and moss, the removal of one or more of them does not hamper the creature either, Remaining vines along the torso will join together to form a new limb by the next round.Only when enough of the shambling mound has been hacked away will the creature die.

                Note that a wounded shambling mound need only retreat to a dense clump of wet foliage to heal.It will rise again in 12 hours,
                fully healed.It is likely to be very angry as well.

                Since shamblers gain power from electrical attacks, it is sus -
                pected that there may exist some shamblers that are vastly larger than the common ones seen thus far.Since will - o - wisps and shamblers often inhabit the same desolate regions of the world, it is possible that shambling mounds of 20 Hit Dice or more lie in
                the deepest, darkest swamps and jungles.Shark

                8 HD: 650 15 HD; 8, 000 Sharks are large, finned, voracious carnivores that inhabit all known oceans and seas.They are perhaps the most aggressive eating machines found in the murky deeps.

                Combat: Sharks sense pressure changes underwater, most often caused by noises from other creatures.Thrashing about in the water always attracts sharks, since usually only wounded fish be -
                have like that.Sharks can sense these motions from up to a mile away and once one shark discovers prey, more are soon to fol -
                low.Sharks also attack mercilessly at the scent of blood, which they can likewise detect at distances of a mile or more,

                When a number of sharks gather around a bleeding victim, the scent of the blood and the thrill of the kill send all sharks into a feeding frenzy.Nothing escapes from such an attack, not even some sharks.Sharks eat anything living, even each other, during a feeding frenzy.Since sharks move up, take a bite of flesh, and retreat very quickly, up to ten normal - sized sharks can attack a man - sized opponent in the water every round.

                Note that the huge megalodons(giant sharks) almost never reach a frenzy, since they are capable of swallowing most crea -
                tures whole on an attack roll that is 4 or more above the minimum number to hit.For example, a 15 - Hit Die megalodon shark hits an AC 0 creature on an attack roll of 8 or more, but swallows that same creature on an attack roll of 12 or greater.Swallowed crea -
                tures suffer 20 points of damage
                for every round they remain in -
                side the shark.A creature trapped within a megalodon can attack the beast from within, but with a cumulative - 1 penalty to dam -
                age per round(i.e., the first round attack has a - 1 penalty, the sec -
                    ond round attack has a - 2 penalty, etc.).The victim must take the shark to 0 points or less before the shark’ s digestive juices finish their work.

                Since most creatures are swallowed quickly by a megalodon,
                there is usually not enough blood in the vicinity to precipitate a feeding frenzy.On occasion, however, fishermen out hunting
                for



                whales and other large water creatures have wounded their prey,
                only to have a swarm of huge prehistoric - sized megalodon sharks strip it to the bone within seconds.Few fishermen argue the point.

                Habitat / Society: Sharks are pure eating and killing machines,
                evolving quite naturally into superior predators, and then re -
                maining unchanged
                for millions of years.They are primarily scavengers, preying on the sick and wounded, but attack fresh meat
                if tempted to do so.They are very territorial and solitary.

                The only friends the sharks have are the sahuagin, who appre -
                ciate the predators
                for their bloody, ruthless, and efficient na -
                tures.They often use sharks as guardians, mounts, sacrifices, and personal pets.The king of all sahuagin is rumored to possess a megalodon shark of largest size, which he apparently feeds quite often.Sahuagin priestesses offer all of their sacrifices to pure white great white sharks of largest size, that are often decorated in collars of gold and silver.

                Sahuagin are the only known race to have successfully trained sharks as mounts and the process is secret.What is known is that a shark and its rider can both attack the same enemy with star -
                tling agility, making the combination one of the most fearsome in
                the deeps.The harness used to mount a sahuagin warrior on the back of a shark is apparently made of a special kind of seaweed,
                unknown to those of the surface world,

                Ecology: Sharks have only two natural weaknesses.The first one is that their internal organs are only poorly protected by a thick, flexible layer of gristle instead of a hard skeleton.Some creatures, such as dolphins, take advantage of this by ramming sharks from the side.Because of their highly intelligent nature,
                dolphins are the only true enemies of sharks.They are the only known species that actively hunts down and kills these otherwise greatly feared and respected monsters.

                Sharks are also forced to continuously move through the water in order to torce sufficient volumes of oxygen - rich water past their primitive gills.Therefore, a shark that is held immobile
                for 2 - 5 hours will die of suffocation.Common spells useful against sharks are hiold monster, paralyzation - attacks and poisons, and all normal damage - causing spells(subject to underwater casting limitations, of course).

                for 12 hours
                if a saving
                throw vs.paralyzation
                fails, The slithering tracker then covers the entire body of its vic -
                tim and slowly draws all of the plasma from the creature(killing the victim in the process, of course).It can drain a man - sized crea -
                ture in one hour.

                Habitat / Society: Slithering trackers are solitary beasts.Since they possess no attack form capable of harming other trackers,
                territoriality is a question of first - come, first - serve.Being the most intelligent of all slimes and jellies, it would seem natural that slithering trackers would establish themselves as the leaders of the rest.But jellies and slimes lack both the means of communication and the intelligence to band together, They remain on the lower end of the monster food chain, serving as scavengers that kill the weak and stupid, leaving the larger creatures
                for major predators in the dungeons they inhabit.

                In fact, slithering trackers often hide themselves in the lairs of large monsters, which are known to kill far more than they can eat at a sitting.The tracker waits until the beast goes to sleep or departs and then it sucks dry the morsels left over.Many times the victims are merely unconscious instead of dead— at least until the tracker gets to them.And on more than one occasion,
                monster - slaying players have left a hoard guarded by a comrade,
                while they go
                for help, only to
                return to find their friend mysteri -
                    ously dehydrated, with all of the treasure still in the lair.









                Ecology: There are two theories regarding the origin of slither -
                ing trackers.The first and most likely one is that slithering track -
                ers are just advanced forms of the other jellies, fortunate enough to have developed a transparent plasma body and a modicum of intelligence, Like most jellies, they reproduce asexually when the time and quantity of food allow
                for it.

                The second, more dubious theory, is that slithering trackers are created, not born.Their high intelligence seems to lead many knowledgeable sages to believe that the creation of a slithering tracker is a hideous process, involving the transformation of a living human being.Certain legends seem to support this asser -
                tion, as there are many accounts of dark wizards removing the bones of their enemies, turning them into hulking masses of jelly -
                like flesh.While it is certain that no respectable wizard(good or neutrally aligned) would resort to creating such horrors, it is just as certain that there are many practitioners of the darker arts who have performed much worse experiments.

                It is possible that somewhere deep in the bowels of some long -
                deserted wizard 's dungeon, there lies an ancient diary, with a de-
                tailed account of the terrifying curse of the tracker.

                There are tales of abnormally large slithering trackers that live in the deep recesses of the Underdark.Such monsters are often said to lurk around the edges of great underground civilizations,
                growing to vast size on the abundance of prey.Slug, Giant

                Giant slugs are huge, omnivorous mutations of the small and be -
                nign garden slugs.Their highly developed mouths are capable of chewing flesh and well as plants, and they spit a highly corrosive acid on their food.Most giant slugs are pale gray, with dead white underbellies.

                Combat: Giant slugs can bite
                for 1 d12 points of damage, but their main attack form is their corrosive acid saliva.The acid is spat at a single target and corrodes any organic tissue(plants or animals).It will also destroy equipment(saving
                    throw vs.acid).The acid inflicts 4 d8 points of damage(successful saving
                    throw vs.breath weapon
                    for one - half damage), Giant slugs can use this breath weapon every round(its acid stores are never used up).Slugs are not very accurate with this attack; the first shot has only a 10 % chance of hitting.The success of subsequent shots depends on the distance to the target— the base chance of hitting is 90 % at a distance of ten yards, with a - 10 % penalty per additional ten yards.If the slug misses, the acid hits 10 feet from the desired tar -
                get(determine randomly which direction).Note that giant slugs are impervious to this acid spittle.

                Giant slugs are immensely strong and can batter down doors and wooden buildings in seconds.They have no bones and can squeeze through holes and crevasses normally impassible to much smaller predators.For example, a party of adventurers might seek cover in a large stone building,
                while taunting the slowly approaching slug behind them.To their astonishment, the huge creature enters through the same doorway the party did and begins to send acid everywhere.

                The rasping tongue of a giant slug enables it to burrow through one foot of earth or six inches of wood per round, making most standard barricades useless against it.

                Because of their lack of bones and their thick, rubbery hides,
                giant slugs are not harmed by blunt weapons or spells that cause crushing or impact damage, Only edged and pointed weapons, as well as certain magical spells, can harm a giant slug.





                Habitat / Society: Giant slugs can be found in any wet and dark environment, including deserted dungeons, swamps, and rain forests.Giant slugs are solitary creatures and speak no language.They are barely sentient, exhibiting only rudimentary instinctive reactions when confronted.

                Ecology: No one has ever found a good use
                for giant slugs, ex -
                cept maybe as huge garbage disposals.They have no known predators.They will eat anything— plants, carrion, garbage— but prefer warm, living flesh when they can
                catch it.Since giant slugs have such huge appetites, they rarely attack smaller crea -
                tures, such as squirrels and monkeys, which they have a hard time seeing anyway.Even on a good day, they must usually sup -
                plement their feedings with some vegetation.

                Normal slugs have a nasty reaction to salt when it is sprinkled on them.They dry up and die in 1 d4 + 1 rounds.It is unlikely that this technique is adaptable to the giant variety, but some fabrica -
                tion and summoning spells might be adaptable
                if there ever seemed to be a need
                for it.

                For now, giant slugs remain a very real danger in jungles,
                for -
                ests, and dungeons everywhere.

Androsphinx

Androsphinxes are huge, winged mythological creatures with the
bodies of male lions and man - like facial features.They can speak
the languages of common and all sphinxes,

Combat: The male, or andro - , sphinx is the most powerful of
the sphinxes.Its huge paws can kill a normal man with just one
swipe.If brute force is not successful, an androsphinx can cast
spells as
if a 6 th - level priest.Note that most androsphinxes use
these spells
for healing and defense rather than damage and at -
    tack.

The androsphinx has another special weapon as well— his bel -
    lowing roar.It can roar three times per day, but must be very an -



    gry to do so.The first time an angry androsphinx roars, all
    creatures within 360 yards must roll successful saving throws vs.
wands or flee in panic
for three turns.When an already angry an -
    drosphinx is continually molested, even after bellowing once, it
can roar even louder, causing al
] creatures within 200 yards to roll
successful saving throws vs.petrification or be paralyzed with
fright
for 1 d4 rounds.In addition,
    any creatures within 30 yards
of this second roar are automatically deafened
for 2 d6 rounds(unless they are deaf already or have protected hearing organs).
Any creature foolish enough to anger an androsphinx further will
unleash his third and final roar with devastating effects.All crea -
    tures within 240 yards must successfully roll saving throws vs.
spell or lose 2 d4 points of Strength
for 2 d4 rounds(use - 1 point equals - 10 %
        for characters with exceptional Strength).In addi -
    tion to the weakness effects,
    any creature within 30 yards of the
androsphinx is knocked over unless it is eight feet tall or larger.
Creatures knocked over suffer 2 d8 points of damage and must
roll a successful saving
throw vs.breath weapon to avoid being
stunned
for 2 d6 rounds.The force of this third roar is so powerful
that stone within 30 yards cracks under the strain,
unless it suc -
    cessfully saves vs.crushing blow.

Habitat / Society: Androsphinxes are the most solitary of the
sphinxes,
They shun gynosphinxes because they are jealous of the
higher intelligence of their female counterparts,
and find their
neutral disposition a bit hard to deal with.However,
    most an -
    drosphinxes eventually succumb to the advances of a gynosphinx
at least once in their lives.

Ecology: What is strangest about androsphinxes is not their
combination lion / human appearance(as there are many such cross - mutations found in the world),
    but their apparent lack of
purpose.They are by far the strongest of the sphinxes,
    but unlike
their counterparts,
have no true pattern of behavior universal to
all androsphinxes.They despise communicating with humans
and hate riddles(mostly because gynosphinxes love them so much).It is therefore suggested by those knowledgeable in myth -
    ological beasts and desert lore that androsphinxes are the guard -
    ians of the sphinxes,
    evil(hieraco - ),
    neutral(gyno - and crio - ),
    and
good(andro - ).

Sphinx



Certainly,
androsphinxes are the lifelong adversaries of the
hieracosphinxes,
but they almost always
let the defeated enemy
go free instead of finishing the kill(often with a roar or two at the fleeing sphinxes behinds).

In short,
androsphinxes are free - roaming sphinxes sworn to de -
    fend other sphinxes against other races,
    namely men and their ilk.
They have been known to bargain with men on occasion,
but are
the least greedy of the sphinxes,
and are the only sphinxes likely
to take offense at such offerings
if made by characters with low
Charismas or evil alignments.

Gynosphinxes

The gynosphinx is the female counterpart of the androsphinx,
having a winged lion 's body and human-like facial features.
Gynosphinxes are not nearly as powerful as androsphinxes,
but
they are much more knowledgeable,
clever,
and wise.Gynos -
    phinxes speak all sphinx languages as well as common.

Combat: Gynosphinxes can attack with two paws,
    but prefer to
bargain with their opponents.They help strangers only
if they are
paid.They accept payment
for services rendered or knowledge
and advice given, in the form of gems(preferred),
    jewelry,
    magic,
    or knowledge.Knowledge that would be of special interest to a
gynosphinx is the location of an androsphinx,
but they accept
fine prose,
poetry,
lore,
or a good riddle.

If anyone breaks a bargain with a gynosphinx,
he is subject to
attack and the gynosphinx won 't hesitate to devour the victim if it
wins the fight.The gynosphinx can cast the following spells once
per day: detect magic,
    read magic,
    read languages,
    detect invisi -
    bility,
    locate object,
    dispel magic,
    clairaudience,
    clairvoyance,
    remove curse,
    and legend lore.It can also use each symbol once
per week.Note that a gynosphinx is very intelligent and can use
these spells in many ways.If a bargaining group of adventurers
steps back to discuss their plans among themselves,
the gynos -
    phinx will growl a little and cast clairaudience to listen in .

Habitat / Society: Gynosphinxes are solitary by nature,
    but not
by choice.They spend most of their lives avoiding the advances
of criosphinxes(which they detest) and hieracosphinxes(which they fear),
    and searching high and low
for an androsphinx,
Gynosphinxes are intelligent enough to actively seek out ruins
and mystical places,
like forgotten temples and such,
which they
immediately occupy.Using their many spells to learn as much as
possible about the setting,
they then wait
for the next group of
travelers,
pilgrims,
or adventurers to come by and hope that
they 've encountered an androsphinx in their travels or have spells
or magical items that might be usable
for just such a purpose.

Ecology: Gynosphinxes own the dubious distinction of being
the only female sphinx.A gynosphinx mated with an andros -
    phinx will produce another androsphinx or gynosphinx(even chances
        for both).A gynosphinx mated with a criosphinx only
produces another male criosphinx,
while mating with a hieracos -
    phinx produces similarly displeasing results.

Fortunately,
gynosphinxes are much smarter than all of their
counterparts and can avoid otherwise compromising situations
through trickery and outright deceit.Unfortunately,
    they are
among the slowest of the sphinxes when flying or running,
and
the lustful criosphinx and vicious hieracosphinx rarely give up the
chase once a gynosphinx has been located.

Criosphinxes

Criosphinxes have the bodies of winged lions,
but they have the
heads of rams.They are always male.They can speak their own
dialect of sphinx,
as well as that spoken by andro / gynosphinxes
and the languages of animals.

Combat;
Criosphinxes attack with their two paws or with a
head butt with their ram 's horns. Because they cast no spells and
are not the brightest of sphinxes,
their bargains with other beings
are limited to“ safe passage or die.”They love treasure and lust af -
    ter gynosphinxes constantly.Plenty of wealth,
    or knowledge of
the location of a gynosphinx’ s lair,
is always enough
for adventur -
    ers to avoid confrontation with criosphinxes.

Habitat / Society: Criosphinxes prize wealth and usually seek to
extort passers - by
for safe passage in exchange
for a hefty bribe.
They are sometimes found in packs of two or more,
    but only be -
    cause all of these sphinxes are looking
for the same gynosphinx.
They often follow other criosphinxes,
even
if they have no idea
whether or not the leader really knows where he 's going. When a
number of criosphinxes find a gynosphinx,
the first order of busi -
    ness is to restrain their prey.Usually pushing boulders in front of
the lair with their huge horns is sufficient.Then the criosphinxes
butt horns like rams,
except these creatures do their fighting in the
air.The winner gets the prize.

More often than not,
however,
criosphinxes begin their combat
immediately upon finding their quarry,
and inevitably the victor
strides forth to find the gynosphinx gone.While the criosphinxes
often find themselves richer
for their trouble,
as the gynosphinx
rarely sees the need
for material wealth
while it is fleeing,
it is
only a poor reward indeed
for their often decades - long quest.

Ecology: Criosphinxes are obviously just further mutations of
the already mysterious sphinx form.Their ability to speak with
animals seems to be an evolutionary necessity,
as criosphinxes are
particularly fond of warm wooded areas,
often bordering on the
desert lands preferred by gynosphinxes.

Hieracosphinxes

Hieracosphinxes are the only evil members of their breed.They
have the bodies of lions,
but the wings and head of hawks.They
are always males.They speak the languages of the other
sphinxes,
and some(20 % ) also speak common.

Combat: Hieracosphinxes do not cast spells, much like the
    criosphinxes,
    but make up
for their weaknesses with tenacious
evil and viciousness.Their paws and sharp beaks are deadly in
    combat,
    and they have been known to swoop down on victims.

Habitat / Society: Hieracosphinxes live in hilly regions exclu -
    sively,
    dwelling in caves overlooking the nearby deserts.They de -
    light in evil and sometimes gather in bands of as many as six to do
        their vile business.Most often when a band of hieracosphinxes is
    encountered,
    it is hot in pursuit of an androsphinx,
    which they
hate with all of their beings.Only in numbers can they hope to
deteat so powerful an adversary,
and these sphinxes never believe in honor or playing fair.While it is true that a victorious andros -
    phinx sometimes lets the defeated flee( in the vain hope that the battle may change the losers’ dispositions),
    a defeated andros -
    phinx is always ripped to pieces when the hieracosphinxes are nu -
    merous enough and lucky enough to win the fight.

Hieracosphinxes also spend much of their time searching
for a
gynosphinx to mate with,
but prefer to kill an androsphinx and
inhabit his lair until a gynosphinx eventually arrives(usually by following old rumors and legends).It is worthwhile to note that
there are more hieracosphinxes than criosphinxes.

Ecology: Hieracosphinxes are belligerent mutations of un -
    known origin.It is believed that they were created by elder gods
of evil merely to wreak havoc on the other,
more pleasant
sphinxes described above.

Giant squids are huge varieties of the normal,
peaceful,
tentacled
cephalopods(unshelled invertebrates).

They have ten long tentacles,
two of which are always used to
maintain stability when attacking or defending,
and long,
pro -
    tected heads with two eyes.Their beak - like mouths are located
where the tentacles meet the lower portion of their bodies.

Combat: Giant squids prefer to grab their opponents in their
tentacles and constrict them,
while they bring the thrashing vic -
    tims into their huge jaws.As many as eight tentacles can attack
one opponent,
but only one at a time can constrict a man - sized
opponent(the rest are free to attack anything
    else within reach).
The rubbery tentacles are so strong they cannot be broken by
force and must be severed.A giant squid 's tentacles hit for 1d6
points of damage and constrict
for 2 d6 points of damage every
round after the initial strike.The beak of a giant squid inflicts 5 d4
points of damage.

Any character who is constricted may have one arm(01 - 25 %
        left, or 26 - 50 % right),
    no arms(51 - 75 % ),
    or both arms(76 -
        100 % ) pinned.A constricted character cannot cast any spells,
    but
he can grab a weapon and attack the tentacle(
    if only one arm is free, he attacks with a - 3 penalty to the attack roll;
    if both arms are free, the penalty is - 1).A giant squid’ s tentacle requires 12
points of damage from sharp or edged weapons to sever(these hit points are in addition to the hit points from Hit Dice).

If a giant squid has four or more tentacles severed,
the monster
is 80 % likely to squirt out a cloud of jet - black ink 60 feet high by
60 feet wide and 80 feet long.The squid then jets away and re -
    treats to its lair.The ink completely obscures the vision of all
within the cloud,

A giant squid can drag ships of small size to the bottom and can
halt the movement of larger ones in one turn of dragging.After
six or more tentacles have squeezed the hull of the ship
for three
consecutive rounds,
the vessel suffers damage as
if it had been
rammed and it begins to take on water and sink.

Kraken

A kraken is a rare form of gargantuan squid.It is one of the most
deadly monsters in existence.











Combat: Krakens attack as huge varieties of giant squid.Two of
their tentacles are barbed and cause 3 d6 points of damage when
they hit.They then
try to drag prey toward their gaping maws
for
a bite of 7 d4 points of damage.The other six free tentacles inflict
2 d6 points of damage when they hit and constrict
for 3 d6 points
each round thereafter.A kraken’ s tentacle must suffer 18 points of
damage from sharp or edged weapons to be severed(these hit points are in addition to those the kraken gets from its Hit Dice).

If three of more of its tentacles have been severed,
the monster
is 80 % likely to retreat,
    leaving behind a cloud of ink to discour -
    age pursuit.The kraken is 50 % likely to retreat to its den
if four
or more of its tentacles have victims.lt leaves behind an ink cloud in this
case also.The ink cloud of a kraken is 80 feet high by 80
feet wide by 120 feet long and is poisonous(it dissipates in 2 - 5 rounds).Those within the cloud receive 2 d4 points of damage
every round they remain.Krakens jet away to their lairs at a
movement rate 21.

Krakens can drag ships of 60 feet long down in the same way as
normal giant squids attack.They have the innate power to cause
airy water in a sphere 120 yards across or in a hemisphere 240 yards
across(they can do this continuously),
They can employ the fol -
lowing spell - like powers,
one at a time,
at will:
    faerie fire
    for up to
    eight hours,
    control temperature in a 40 - yard radius continuously,
        control winds once per day,
        weather surnmoning once per day,
        and
    animal summoning I](fish only) three times per day(note that this spell does not grant control of the fish once summoned).

    Krakens are not affected by the conch horns of tritons.

    Habitat / Society: Krakens have Intelligences of genius or higher
    and often control entire regions of the underwater world.Their
    lairs lie thousands of feet below the surface and they maintain
    huge complexes of caverns where they keep and breed human
    slaves to serve and feed them.

    Ecology: Krakens can breathe either air or water and are ag -
        gressive hunters.Many tropical islands have been completely
    stripped of all inhabitants(animal and human) by krakens.

    It is said that krakens retreated to the depths when the forces of
    good thwarted their attempt to rule the seas, but it is also said that in the future krakens will rise again.

            MORALE: Average(8) XP VALUE: 175

            Stirges are bird - like creatures that drink the blood of their victims
            for sustenance.They have four small, pincer - like legs they use to clamp onto the necks of their victims.They are mostly rusty red to red - brown in color and their eyes and feet are yellowish, The dangling proboscises of stirges are pink at the tip, fading to gray at the base(near the heads).

            Combat: Stirges attack as 4 - Hit Die creatures, rather than 1 + 1. The long proboscis inflicts 1 - 3 points of damage when it hits, and drains 1 d4 points of blood every round thereafter.When a stirge drains a total of 12 points of blood from a victim, it becomes bloated and flies off to digest its protein - rich meal.

            Stirges must be killed to be removed, due to their strong grip.If an attack against an attached stirge misses, roll another attack roll against the victim 's Armor Class to see if the attack hits the
            victim instead.Caution is advisable when attempting to remove an attached stirge.

            Habitat / Society: Stirges form nest - like colonies in attics,
            dungeons, and dark copses of trees.Although they resemble birds, they hang upside down when sleeping, indicating that stirges may be closely related to vampire bats.

            They can be bred in captivity, as some vampires have done to cover their own tracks, but a constant supply of blood is needed.Stirges kill most low - level humans, animals, and children, so the arrival of these creatures to any civilized area is always cause
            for alarm.Fortunately, even a low - level group of adventurers or town militia is usually capable of ending the menace with little or no loss of life.

            Ecology: Stirges have 240 - foot infravision and an acute sense of smel].These two factors keep stirges informed of any living crea -
        tures that enter their habitat.Creatures with natural ACs of 3 or
    better are usually immune to a stirge’ s blood draining attack, as
    their hides are too thick to penetrate.Characters who are spe -
        cially protected over their entire body by leather or better(this special armor costs two to three times more than normal armor)
    can safely approach a stirge.Even the slightest gap in the protec -
        tion is seen and smelled by the creature, and a successful attack
    roll means the creature has broken through the weakness and











    locked on.

    After a stirge has drained enough blood to engorge itself, it
    sleeps
    for one day plus one day
    for every 2 points of blood it
    drank(thus the maximum sleep is after drinking 12 points of blood— seven days), During this period of rest, quiet attackers
    can impose a - 2 penalty to the stirges’ surprise roll, as the beasts
    wake slowly and remain drowsy
    for a few moments.They are
    most vulnerable a: this time.While certain species of stirges pre -
        fer to dine on human blood, most are content with any large
    mammal, like cows, moose, and deer, Experienced druids and
    rangers usually recognize the traces of a stirge colony by the oc -
        currences of mysteriously drained and dead animals in the vicin -
        ity.

    A stirge colony 's territory extends for only a mile in diameter,
    so stirges move around a lot after they 've drained their latest re-
    gion of food.Many times, the presence of stirges is only discov -
        ered long after the colony has departed, making it very hard to
    track them.

    There are rumored to be exceptionally large varieties of stirges
    deep in the densest tropical jungles.They purportedly also havea
    paralyzing poison at the tips of their sharp snouts that is highly
    prized by local tribesmen.They have been known to mingle with
    giant vampire bats, None of these larger versions have ever been
    captured and examined by sages, so nothing
    else is known about
    their strengths or weaknesses.What little of them is known came
    from the cannibals and head hunters of the jungle regions.

    Swanmays are human females who can transform into swans, In
    human form, swanmays are indistinguishable from other people.
    They normally possess the light armor and attendant gear of
    rangers, as well as a sword, dagger, bow, and arrows.These
    items do not transform when they do,
        hence these must be hid -
        den.Swanmays may be recognized by a feather token, feathered
    garment, or signet ring.Such items are either transformed into
    part of the swans’ plumage or worn on a leg.

    Combat: In human form, the swanmay functions as a ranger.
    To determine the level of a swanmay, 2 dé6 are rolled;
    the total is
    the swanmay’ 's level and Hit Dice. She attacks with whatever
    weapons she possesses.

    In swan form, she is harmed only by + 1 or better weapons.
    She also has a magical resistance of 2 % per Hit Die.

    Habitat / Society: Swanmays are members of a special sorority
    of lycanthrope - like rangers.Unlike other lycanthropes, the abil -
        ity is attained voluntarily through the acquisition of a special to -
        ken.This may be a feather token, a feathered garment, or a signet
    ring.All such items reveal their magical auras when exposed to a
    detect magic spell, Without the item, a swanmay is stuck in her
    current form.Such items only

    function
    for swanmays.

    Swanmays are extremely secretive about their sorority, Only
    human women are admitted;
    the other requirements are un -
        known.It is suspected that women are invited to join when they
    unknowingly perform a great service
    for another swanmay.If a
    PC is invited to join the sorority, it is 50 % likely that she retires
    from casual adventuring to devote herself full time to her new re -
        sponsibilities.

    Swanmays are guided by their swan personalities.They dislike
    noisy, brash creatures, ferocious beasts, and anything evil in
        alignment.They are friendly with the little folk of the forest, such
    as sylvan elves and dryads.They tend to avoid normal human -
        oids.Only nature - oriented priests are known to regularly associ -
        ate with swanmays;
    such alliances are generally initiated by
    swanmays when they require assistance against a commen evil.

    Swanmays build communal lodgings near bodies of water deep in the forest.Such lodgings are lightly fortified against attack by











    land.They usually contain two means of escape— including a se -
        cret tunnel that leads into the lake and a ceiling hatch.Swanmays
    transform into swan form to use either means of escape.Swan -
        may lodgings may be recognized by the number of waterfow
    liv -
        ing in the area.The remains of a poacher may also be positioned
    here as a warning to others of his kind.

    Ecology: Swanmays act as independent protectors of the forests
    and wildlife.They actively oppose evil races or monsters that
    might otherwise decimate wildlife and the countryside.They
    have a philosophical link to swans, though it is important to re -
        member that they are not swans.

    Swan

    These aquatic birds tend to inhabit areas frequented by similar
    waterfowl.Such areas include rivers, ponds, lakes, and marshes.

    There is a 10 % chance that any swan encounter includes one or
    more swanmays in avian form.Twenty - five percent of swan
    encounters are with a solitary swan;
    if it is a normal swan, it is al -
        ways male(a“ cob”).Otherwise, such encounters are mated pairs
    of cobs and pens(females) with their cygnet offspring.There are
    1 - 2 cygnets or 1 - 3 eggs per mated pair.If the swans’ territory is in -
        vaded, both adults forcefully attack the intruder by a flying leap,
        bite, and blows from both wings.Such an attack is 50 % likely to
    blind or confuse an opponent; in this
case, the foe is unable to
make any attack the following melee round.

Swans possess acute senses.They are 90 % likely to detect in -
truders.When detection occurs, all swans join in a loud warning
chorus.If there are no eggs, the swans swim or fly away.Sylph

            Sylphs are beautiful demihumans that dwell in high altitudes.They are friendly and may(20 % ) befriend adventurers and give them aid in exchange
            for a favor.

            Sylphs appear to be young, beautiful humanoid women with fairy - like wings.They are short by human standards.Their two wings resemble those of a dragonfly and may measure four to five feet long; the wings may be clear, translucent, or have patches of iridescent color.Their long, brightly colored hair may be any of the normal humanoid colors or unusual shades like blue, purple.or green.Dress normally consists of flowing, diaphanous robes.The robes accent the color of their wings or hair.

            Sylphs speak common and their own musical language.

            Combat: Sylphs do not physically attack their opponents.In -
                stead they employ a variety of magical abilities.

            A sylph possesses the magical abilities of a 7 th - level wizard.She can cast four 1 st - level, three 2 nd - level, two 3 rd - level, and one 4 th - level spell each day.In addition, the sylph can become in -
            visible at will and summon an air elemental once each week.

            Habitat / Society: Sylphs are aerial relatives of nymphs and dry -
            ads.They dwell in elevated places, such as mountains, hills, or the tops of trees.They rarely touch ground in the lowlands.Sylphs are normally solitary beings.They are fond of constant travel, thus it is unlikely one would ever be encountered near its home,

            Sylph nests are highly individualistic.Some may reside in sim -
            ple nests formed from whatever materials are available,
            while other sylphs may build elaborate retreats tucked away in the tall -
            est trees or carved into mountainsides.

            Sylphs prefer to keep their possessions simple and light.They keep only gems and magical items as treasure.Coins are consid -
            ered too heavy, too bulky, and too dull.They may trade their wealth
            for furnishings
            for the home, such as light draperies, silks,
            and pillows.There is a 1 % chance that, should adventurers dis -
            cover a sylph’ s home, that they also find a sylph 's egg or child.

            All sylphs are female.When one wants a child, it seeks a hu -
            manoid suitor.Sylphs prefer those of elven blood, although they may consent to a human or halfling mate.Three months after conception, the sylph lays a pearly egg in a special nest.She sum -











            mons an air elemental to protect the egg and keep it warm.Six months later, the egg hatches a baby girl with wing buds.The young sylph grows at the same rate as a human child.For the first four years, the wings remain roughly the same size as the child 's
            head, In the fifth year, the wings begin to grow along with magi -
            cal abilities.The child first develops the ability to glide, then hover.Full flight occurs by the tenth year.

            The sylph’ s flying ability is magical in nature.It possesses the innate ability to levitate.The wings are needed only to provide thrust.If a sylph’ s wings are injured, it can only glide or hover.Anti - magical attacks may ground a sylph by negating its power of levitation.

            Every 28 years, all the sylphs gather together into the grand so -
            rority.Hundreds of sylphs may be present.During this time, the sylphs renew friendships, trade acquisitions, share news and in -
            formation gathered from their travels, and welcome young sylphs.

            Sylphs have life spans akin to elves.They retain their youthful appearance throughout their lives.

            Ecology: Sylphs are members of one of a number of magical races that resemble humanoid women.Usually they maintain their dis -
            tance from the more mundane humanoid races.They possess few natural enemies, Aerial monsters may occasionally feed on them,
            but this is a rare
            case .They are in greater danger from humanoid males of evil alignments who may attempt to capture them
            for dark purposes.

                    XP VALUE: 107, 000

                    The legendary tarrasque,
                    for there is fortunately only one known to exist, is the most dreaded monster native to the Prime Material plane.The creature is a scaly biped with two horns on its head, a lashing tail, and a reflective carapace.

                    Combat: The tarrasque is a killing machine and when active(see below) eats everything
                    for miles around, including all ani -
                    mals and vegetation.Normal attacks are with its two forelimb claws(1 d12 points of damage each), a sweeping tail lash(2 d12 points of damage), a savage bite(5 d10 points of damage plus acts as asword of sharpness, severing a limb on a natural attack roll of 18 or better), and two thrusting horn attacks(1 d10 points of dam -
                        age each).

                    Once every turn, the normally slow - moving tarrasque can rush forward at a movement rate of 15, making all horn attacks cause double damage and trampling anything underfoot
                    for 4 d10 points of crushing damage.

                    The mere sight of the tarrasque causes creatures with less than 3 levels or Hit Dice to be paralyzed with fright(no saving
                        throw) until it is out of their vision.Creatures of 3 or more levels or Hit Dice flee in panic, although those of 7 or more levels or Hit Dice that manage to succeed with a saving
                    throw vs.paralyzation are
                    not affected(though they often still decide to run away).

                    The tarrasque’ s carapace is exceptionally tough and highly re -
                    flective.Bolts and rays such as lightning bolts, cones of cold, and even magic missiles are useless against it, The reflection is such that 1 in 6 of these attacks actually bounces directly back at the caster(affecting him normally),
                    while the rest bounce off harm -
                    lessly to the sides and into the air.

                    The tarrasque is also immune to all heat and fire, and it regen -
                    erates lost hit points at a rate of 1 hit point per round.Only en -
                    chanted weapons(+1 or better) have any hope of harming the tarrasque.

                    Habitat / Society: It is fortunate that the tarrasque is active only
                    for short periods of time.Typically, the monster comes forth to forage
                    for a week or two, ravaging the countryside
                    for miles around, The tarrasque then seeks a hidden lair underground and lies dormant, sleeping
                    for 5 d4 months before coming forth again.Once every decade or so, the monster is particularly active, stay -











                    ing awake
                    for several months.Thereafter its period of dormancy is 4 d4 years unless disturbed.The ratio of active to dormant states seems to be about 1: 30.

                    Ecology: Slaying of the tarrasque is said to be possible only
                    if the monster is reduced to - 30 or fewer hit points and a wish is then used.Otherwise, even the slightest piece of the tarrasque can re -
                    generate and restore the monster completely.Legend says that a great treasure can be extracted from the tarrasque 's carapace. The
                    upper portion, treated with acid and then heated in a furnace, is thought to yield gems(10 d10 diamonds of 1, 000 gp base value each).The underbelly material, mixed with the creature 's blood
                    and adamantite, is said to produce a metal that can be forged by master dwarven blacksmiths into 1 d4 shields of + 5 enchantment.It takes two years to manufacture each shield, and the dwarves aren 't likely to do it for free,

                    It is hoped that the tarrasque is a solitary creation, some hid -
                    eous abomination unleashed by the dark arts or by elder,
                    forgotten gods to punish all of nature.The elemental!nature of the tarrasque leads the few living tarrasque experts to speculate that the elemental princes of evil have something to do with its exist -
                        ence.In any
                    case,
                    the location of the tarrasque remains a mystery,
                    as it rarely leaves witnesses in its wake, and nature quickly grows over all remnants of its presence.It is rumored that the tarrasque is responsible
                    for the extinction of one ancient civilization,
                    for the records of their last days spoke of a“ great reptilian punisher sent by the gods to end the world.”

                        Tasloi are long - legged, flat - headed humanoids.They walk in a crouching posture, touching their knuckles to the ground from time to time.Their skins are a lustrous green and are thinly cov -
                        ered with coarse black hair.Their eyes are similar to a cat 's and
                        are gold in color.

                        Often they can be heard at night, speaking in their high, whis -
                        pery voices.Tasloi speak their own tongue and can also speak the languages of monkeys and apes.About 5 % of their kind have learned a pidgin common that they use when trading.

                        Combat: Tasloi like to hide in tree tops and drop down on the weak and unwary.They are quick and nimble in the trees, but slow and clumsy on the ground, When they are in jungle, their stealthy movements impose a - 4 penalty to opponents’ surprise rolls.They also hide in shadows, like a thief, with 75 % effective -
                        ness.Their infravision enables them to see up to 90 feet in dark -
                        ness, but they hate daylight and suffer a - 1 penalty to their attack roll when fighting in broad daylight.

                        Tasloi carry the following weapons: small shield(AC 5) and javelin— 20 % , club and javelin— 40 % , short sword and small shield(AC 5)— 10 % , javelin and net— 15 % , short sword and net— 10 % , or javelin and lasso— 5 % .Tasloi without shields are AC 6. They customarily carry all javelins and shields on their backs when they travel through the trees.

                        Tasloi eat anything, but they enjoy all kinds of flesh, especially humans and elves.They normally attack from above, trying to capture
                        if possible.If they gain surprise, they use their ten - foot -
                        diameter nets to trap their prey(the nets totally entangle those of less than 15 Strength; those of 15 or greater Strength need a suc -
                            cessful open doors roll to rip the net and escape).If a party is too vigilant or prepared, the tasloi attempt to wear down the group through short, sudden attacks followed by retreat.If possible,
                        tasloi
                        try to steal the enemy 's dead after an attack.

                        Habitat / Society: The tasloi live in loosely - structured bands of several families.In every band of 70 or more, there is a chief of 5 Hit Dice.There is a 30 % chance that any band has a shaman.Tas -
                        loi shamans may advance up to Sth level.

                        When found in their lair, in addition to the males, there are fe -
                        males and young equal to 70 % and 50 % of the number of males,

                        respectively.Females fight as males, but the young do not fight at
                        all.The lair consists of a series of 1 d6 large trees with 4 dé6 plat -
                        forms 50 - 100 feet above the ground.All the trees are connected by vines and ropes.There is a 60 % chance that the tasloi have 1 d6 trained giant spiders and a 20 % chance that they have 2 d4 trained giant wasps.Tasloi are able to ride these wasps
                        for great dis -
                        tances, and the spiders aid in the construction, protection, and overall maintenance of the tree - village.

                        Ecology: It is not known where and how tasloi originated.It is likely they have been around
                        for many millennia, interbreeding in deep isolated jungles.Their primitive lifestyle has probably ex -
                        isted in much the same fashion
                        for thousands upon thousands of years.

                        While certainly among the least fearsome of all jungle crea -
                        tures, tasloi are perhaps worth worrying about in numbers, or af -
                        ter fleeing encounters with nastier jungle denizens.Tasloi know the location of such lairs and often set up obvious escape routes
                        for any creature that foolishly finds itself confronting the beast.The tasloi then lay their traps along the escape path and wait
                        for the weakened, unsuspecting creatures to run through blindly.This strategy is highly successful, apparently, as the tasloi boast many more trophies than their small size and limited prowess might otherwise indicate.

                Tritons are rumored to be creatures from the elemental plane of Water that have been placed on the Prime Material plane
                for some purpose unknown to man, They are sea dwellers, inhabiting warmer waters principally but equally able to live at shallow or great depths.

                The lower half of a triton ends in two finned legs,
                while its torso, head, and arms are handsomely human.Tritons have a sil -
                very skin that fades into silver - blue scales on the lower half of their bodies.Their hair is deep blue or blue - green.Triton speak their own language as well as those of sea elves and locathah.

                Combat: Tritons carry either tridents(60 % ) or long spears(40 % ).Some 25 % are also armed with heavy crossbows.When equipped
                for battle, tritons wear armor made of scales(AC 4).

                Outside their lair, tritons are 90 % likely to be mounted, either on hippocampi(65 % ) or giant sea horses(35 % ).These mounts fight in defense of their riders.

                Exceptional tritons(see below) and triton leaders always carry conch shells with them.Not magical, their sounds are well known to all marine creatures.When blown properly by an exceptional triton, a conch summons 5 d4 hippocampi, 1 d10 sea lions, or 5 d6 giant sea horses.These creatures swim to the aid of the summon -
                ing triton, arriving 1 d6 rounds after the conch is first sounded.The conchs can also be sounded to frighten aquatic animals as the fear spell.This latter noise causes all marine creatures within 60 feet and with animal Intelligence or less to flee in panic.Creatures are allowed a saving
                throw vs.spell to avoid the fear effect, but
                even those who succeed with their saving throws have a - 5 modi -
                fier on their attack rolls against the tritons.

                Triton are reclusive and nonviolent.They normally attack to capture.If a triton is killed in a battle, however, the fight immedi -
                ately becomes one of retribution.Should the fighting go poorly,
                the tritons withdraw to their lair to either gather reinforcements or make a last stand.

                In addition to their other abilities, tritons are nearly impervi -
                ous to magic with a natural magic resistance of 90 % .











                Habitat / Society: Tritons live either in great undersea castles(80 % chance) or in finely sculpted caverns(20 % ).While tritons lean toward good alignment, they are very suspicious of outsiders and have no love
                for land dwellers in general.

                Tritons rarely kill, unless provoked, but they are quick to ap -
                prehend those who intrude upon their seas.Trespassers found guilty of intentionally entering triton waters or treasure seeking are left“ to the fate of the seas.”This means being stripped of all belongings and set adrift at least ten miles from any shoreline.Characters ruled innocent by the triton court awaken the next day on some distant shore.Tritons never aid land dwellers unless their own interests are involved in the matter.

                For every ten tritons encountered there is an exceptional triton of 4 - 6 Hit Dice.For every 20 encountered there is an exceptional triton with 7 - 8 Hit Dice.Groups of 50 or more are always accom -
                panied by a triton leader(AC 2, 9 Hit Dice).There is a 10 %
                chance
                for every ten tritons encountered that they are accompa -
                nied by a triton mage of 1 dé levels.

                At a triton lair, the following additional tritons are always found:

                60 males(with related exceptional tritons)

                One mage of 7 th - to 10 th - level ability

                One priest of 8 th - to 11 th - level ability

                Four priests of 2 nd - to Sth - level ability

                Female tritons equal to 100 % of males(2 HD, AC 6) Young equal to 100 % of males(noncombatants)

                There is also a 75 % chance that the lair contains 2 d6 sea lions as pets / guards.

                Ecology: Tritons are omnivorous and live on fish, shellfish, and sea weed.They have no natural enemies save the giant squid,
                which is immune to the effects of their conch shells.Normal triton live approximately 300 years
                while their leaders and spellcasters have life expectancies of 500 years or more.Troglodyte

                    Troglodytes are a warlike race of carnivorous reptilian human -
                    oids that dwell in natural subterranean caverns and in the cracks and crevices of mountains.They hate man above all other crea -
                    tures and often launch bloody raids on human communities in
                    search of food and steel.

                    Troglodytes stand about six feet tall, are covered in roughened leathery scales, and have a toothy lizard - like head.Males are eas -
                    ily distinguished from females by the fin - like crest that runs across their heads and down their necks.Coloration
                    for both sexes varies due to the troglodyte’ s chameleon - like ability to change skin tone, but grayish brown is most common.Most trog -
                    lodytes wear little more than a leather weapons belt, with per -
                    haps a small bag of semi - fresh meat.Leaders adorn their belts with pieces of steel, a sign of power in troglodyte culture.Troglo -
                    dytes have excellent infravision(90 - foot range).They speak their own language and no other.

                    Combat: Fifty percent of a troglodyte force use their teeth and claws.The remaining 50 % use weapons; swords(25 % ), stone battle axes(10 % ), stone morning stars(10 % ), or two troglodyte javelins(25 % ).Of special note is the troglodyte javelin.These great darts grant a + 3 bonus to the attack roll when thrown by a troglodyte; they cause 2 d4 points of damage.This bonus reflects the troglodytes’ great skill with these darts.About 25 % of troglo -
                    dytes carry two such darts apiece.

                    Troglodytes prefer ambushes to frontal assaults, Their favorite tactic is to pick a well - trod mountain or subterranean path and then use their chameleon power to blend in with the surrounding rocks.When a likely target walks by, the troglodytes hurl a volley of javelins(this attack gives opponents a - 4 penalty to their sur -
                        prise rolls, but only
                        for the initial round), After a second volley,
                    the troglodytes descend upon their hapless victims.

                    When angered or engaged in melee, troglodytes secrete an oil that smells extremely disgusting to all humans and demihumans.Those failing their saving throws vs.poison are so revolted as to lose 1 d6 points of Strength.This loss remains in effect
                    for 10 rounds.

                    Habitat / Society: Troglodyte society is organized into clans,
                    with each clan led by a chieftain(usually the biggest and most





                        fearsome troglodyte).A number of subchieftains also are present,
                    chosen from those troglodytes that most distinguished them -
                    selves in battle.Rank is loose and internal squabbles common.Most chieftains lead only as long as the clan stays fed(and not one meal longer),

                    For every ten troglodytes encountered there is one leader with 3 Hit Dice.For every 20 there are two subchieftains each with 4 Hit Dice.Groups of 60 or more always include the clan chieftain.The chieftain stands seven feet tall, has 6 Hit Dice, and is accompa -
                    nied by 2 d4 guards with 3 Hit Dice each.

                    Troglodytes usually set their lair near a human or demihuman settlement.This enables them to prey on both the settlers and their livestock.The lair itself is typically a large cave or cavern with a number of smaller chambers adjoining it
                    for the females and hatchlings.Troglodyte lairs contain a number of females equal to 100 % of the males.Females have 1 + 1 Hit Dice each and fight to the death in defense of the hatchlings.Hatchlings number about 50 % of the male population and are noncombatants.

                    Troglodytes value steel above all
                    else, using it to make javelins and as a form of wealth.Individual troglodytes carry nothing of real worth, but their lair may contain considerable treasure amassed from their raids on the outside world.Often this wealth is carelessly strewn about, mixed in with half - eaten food, or just shoved into some out - of - the - way corner,

                    On moonless nights, raiding parties of 50 or more troglodytes venture forth in search of steel and food.These attacks usually target human settlements, where the troglodytes can use their intravision and their chameleon power to maximum advantage.

                    Ecology: Strict carnivores, troglodytes prefer human flesh over all others, but they won 't hesitate to devour practically anything
                    they can
                    catch, including members of other troglodyte clans.Few creatures hunt troglodytes,
                    for their taste is said to be even more vile than their odor.

                        Urchins are a family of marine creatures that, like oysters, are hunted
                        for the value of the stones found in their bodies,

                        They resemble three - foot - diameter balls covered with thou -
                        sands of three - inch - long, needle - sharp spines.There are several species of urchins, which can be distinguished from each other by their distinctive colors.

                        Combat: Urchins can fire their spines with the distance and ac -
                        curacy of light crossbows.An urchin can fire multiple spines per round as listed above under“ No.of Attacks.”Urchins have no eyes with which to see their opponents; instead they possess an innate clairvoyance ability, This ability gives all spines fired by urchins a + 2 bonus to the attack roll.Damage from an urchin spine varies from species to species and many spines contain par -



                        alytic or even lethal poisons, Since urchins are covered with thou -
                        sands of spines, they have a virtually unlimited supply of ammunition.

                        Habitat / Society: Urchins are primarily scavengers, scouring the ocean floors
                        for remains of shellfish.Occasionally they hunt fish,
                        but they never attack man - sized beings unless threatened or ap -
                        proached within ten feet.

                        Urchins live in the shallows and upon shoals near the coast.They occasionally(10 % chance) remain on land during low tide to scavenge
                        for food.While on land, urchins move via rolling.They are capable of surprisingly high speeds when moving this way.

                        Ecology: Inside each urchin is a crystalline organ - gem that seems to have some connection to their innate clairvoyance abil -
                        ity.While this gem has little value as a stone, it is highly prized by alchemists.The exact value of the organ - gem depends on quality and the type of urchin it was taken from, To determine a stone 's
                        value, consult the“ Treasure” entry above.

                            chance) form pearls inside their bodies.Old urchins contain 2 d6 such pearls, each valued at 1 d6 x 100 gold pieces.

                Urds stand three feet tall and have short ivory horns, red -
                rimmed eyes, and flattened noses.Their bodies are thin, frail and covered with mottled yellow to brick - red scales.Leathery, bat -
                like wings sprout from their backs.When flying, these wings stretch eight feet or more across, Urds are quick and maneuver -
                able in the air, capable of gliding
                for long distances or pulling up sharply.On land, urds slouch to counterbalance the wings on their back and move with an awkward half - walk, half - hop gait.Urds wear minimal clothing, but many tribes decorate their bodies with paints made from berries and ground bone.

                tack by dropping stones upon their victims.These“ rock bombs” weigh two to three pounds apiece and are covered with jagged edges and protrusions.Urds drop these rocks with great accuracy.Unsuspecting victims are treated as AC 10
                for the attack roll.Ac -
                tively dodging opponents are considered AC 2 before modifica -
                tions
                for Dexterity.Each rock that hits causes 2 d4 points of damage.About 75 % of the urds encountered carry one rock bomb apiece.The remaining 25 % carry light spears, which can be used either as spears or as javelins.These light spears cause 1 d4 points of damage per hit.

                Urds are unreliable in large battles.They are easily startled,
                particularly by bright lights, such as fireballs, or by large flying creatures, Urds avoid melee unless they outnumber their oppo -
                nents by 10 to 1 or more; even then urds attack only
                if their vic -
                tims are unarmored and no larger than man - size.

                Habitat / Society: Urds live in extended families called gens.A single gen may contain 300 or more adult males and females, plus a number of young and eggs equaling 50 percent of the total adult population.Each gen is controlled by a hereditary chieftain that











                can be of either sex,

                Urds usually make their lairs in isolated mountain caves or,
                when no mountains are near, in carefully concealed underground caverns.An urd lair comprises one main chamber plus a number of smaller chambers
                for the young and eggs.Urds often(70 %
                    chance) share their homes with giant bats(70 % ), keeping them as pets and guardians.

                On the whole, urds are unintelligent and easily frightened.They are quick to attack weaker foes, such as kobolds and gob -
                lins, and readily submit to more powerful creatures.Urd gens of -
                ten swear fealty to wizards or dragons, especially
                if promises of food are made.Units of mercenary urds are sometimes employed by larger armies as scouts or messengers.

                For every 20 urds encountered there is one subchieftain with 7 hit points and an AC of 7. Urd flocks of 100 or more are always accompanied by the gen’ s chieftain.The chieftain is an excep -
                tional urd with 10 hit points and is 50 % likely to be wearing magi -
                cal leather armor.The urd lair always contains 1 d6 shamans who, in addition to their other abilities, can speak with bats as per the spell speak with animals.

                Ecology: Urds place little value on gold and other heavy metals,
                since these are difficult
                for urds to fly with.They prize finely made leather armor and gladly trade
                for such items.

                The diet of urds varies dramatically from gen to gen, depend -

                Urds are hunted by a variety of the avian carnivores, including hippogriffs, manticores, and dragons.Their life spans can theo -

        These unusual creatures are natives of the elemental plane of Water, but they are being encountered more and more on the Prime Material plane.When they are found in this realm, they are violent and hostile, attacking all living things instantly.In some manner that has never been fully divined, they are able to feed on the life essences of those they slay.

        Combat: When first encountered, these creatures seem to be nothing more than a common body of water in a well, fountain,
        or similar basin, The use of a detect invisible spell, however, re -
        veals to the caster that something is amiss, although the specific nature of the threat is not obvious.

        Once the water weird senses a living creature, it begins to change the water into a serpentine form.This transformation takes two rounds to occur.Once in this shape, it lashes out and strikes as a 6 - Hit Die monster.Anyone who is hit by the weird must roll a saving
        throw vs.paralyzation.Failure indicates that
        the victim has been pulled into the water and faces the prospect of drowning.Each round that the victim spends inside the water re -
        quires an additional saving
        throw, with failure indicating death by drowning.

        Many forms of attack cause little or no harm to the water weird because of its fluid body.Sharp weapons, such as swords and axes, inflict only 1 point of damage each time they strike, al -
        though blunt weapons, like hammers and maces, inflict their nor -
        mal damage.Cold - based attacks affect a water weird as a slow spell.Fire - based spells cause half damage
        if the weird fails its sav -
        ing
        throw, no damage
        if it succeeds.

        A water weird that is reduced to 0 hit points by any of these at -
        tacks is not slain, but is disrupted.After two rounds, it re - forms its serpentine body and resumes its attack.Most other types of at -
        tack cannot harm the creature in any way.

        A purify water spell instantly slays a water weird.By breaking down its life essence, this invocation annihilates the creature.Each casting of this spell is effective against only a single entity,
        however, so that an attack by three water weirds must be met with three purify water spells to wholly eliminate the menace.

        A water weird that comes into physical contact with a water el -
        emental may attempt to usurp control of it.In order to accom -
        plish this feat, the creature must roll an 11 or better on 1 d20.











        Failure prevents subsequent attempts during that encounter.

        Habitat / Society: For the most part, these unusual beings are loners who do not interact with others of their kind.On those oc -
            casions when two or three water weirds are found together, it is
        simply because they have found a location were prey is easy to come by.

        Those water weirds found on the Prime Material plane are fre -
        quently the victims of magical bonds that hold them in this realm.As such, they are often watching
        for some way to
        break their links with this world and
        return to their home.Because of their
        keen intelligence, they can be persuaded to refrain from combat
        if a means of communication can be found and a common ground agreed upon, Of course, their chaotic nature makes any bargain reached with a water weird an uncertain proposition at best.

        Ecology: The manner in which water weirds sustain themselves has never been fully determined.As creatures of the elemental plane of Water, they are difficult to study and even harder to un -
        derstand.It seems clear, however, that they feed on the energies released by those who drown within their serpentine bodies.It may be that this is similar in some way to the life energy that is consumed by will - o - wisps.

        For the most part, water weirds found on the Prime Material plane are here by the hand of a wizard who has called the crea -
        tures from their home dimension to serve him in some manner.Weasel

        Weasels are abundant throughout the world 's temperate forests
        and in many subterranean settings.There are numerous species,
        but they are all similar in appearance and habits.

        The weasel is a lithe animal with a slender body and a long neck.The animal 's head is small and triangular with a pointed
        snout and a mouth full of needle - sharp teeth, The various breeds of weasel range from five to 16 inches in length.Nearly all vari -
        eties are brown with white undersides, although the furs of those in colder climates turn white in winter.

        Combat: Asa rule, common weasels do not attack unless they
        are cornered or surprised.When they do strike, however, their
        great speed and darting movements can make them somewhat dangerous.In most cases, however, they bite once and then flee before their adversary recovers.

        Habitat / Society: Weasels are solitary creatures that stalk ro -
        dents and similar small animals
        for food.When two animals are encountered, they are often a mated pair.

        Ecology: When hunting, the weasel usually attacks animals that are larger than itself.A common target in settled regions are do -
            mesticated poultry and similar fowl.Despite this, the common
        weasel does a great service
        for farmers by feeding on small ani -
        mals that might otherwise damage or destroy their crops.

        Weasel pelts are highly prized and can fetch prices as high as 100 gold pieces
        if they are in good condition.It is
        for this reason that in many regions weasels have been hunted to the brink of ex -
        tinction, despite their roles as rodent killers and their importance in the food chain of the forest.The most valuable pelts are those of the weasels that inhabit colder regions, as they have a very pleasing texture and are bright white in color.

        Female weasels make their nests out of straw, leaves, and moss in hollow trees or crevices in the ground.Here they give birth toa litter that generally contains four or five young.

        Weasels that are taken when they are young can be trained to serve as hunting animals or tamed and kept as companions.Gen -
        erally, however, they are too temperamental to make satisfactory pets.











        Giant Weasels

        Giant weasels are giant - sized versions of this species that, al -
        though similar in many respects to normal weasels, are much more vicious and aggressive.Perhaps the most obvious difference is their tendency to live and hunt in packs.They attack men as of -
        ten as any other prey and are relentless adversaries.

        When a giant weasel bites, it locks its jaws onto its victim and refuses to
        let go.Instead, the weasel begins to suck the blood from
        its prey.Agents in the animal 's saliva not only prevent the victim'
        s blood from clotting, but actually promote the bleeding of the wound.The resulting blood loss is so rapid that it causes 2 d6 points of damage per round.After the initial hit is scored, further rolls to inflict damage are not required,

        When the lair of a pack of giant weasels is found, it often con -
        tains a minimum of four animals.There are young equal to the number of adults in the lair; the young are from 10 % to 80 %
        grown.They attack just as the adults would, inflicting damage appropriate to their degree of growth.If taken before they are half - grown, there is a 25 % chance that giant weasels can be trained to serve as hunting or guard animals.

        The pelts of giant weasels are valuable, as are those of their smaller cousins, and an intact one can fetch from 1, 000 to 6, 000 gold pieces on the open market.As a general rule, the most valu -
        able pelts are those of the northern species, which are wholly white in color, or those of the rare black weasels.

        Whale

















        Whales are the largest sea mammals.They are highly intelligent creatures that occupy a number of ecological niches.The com -
        mon whales include plankton eaters like blue or hump - backed whales and carnivores like sperm whales.

        Common whales range in size from a ten - foot - long calf to 110 -
        foot - long blue whales, The skin is normally blue - gray, Whales share a common language that is difficult
        for land creatures to learn since it uses tones below human hearing.

        Combat: All common whales can attack with their tails.These can deliver a crushing blow that inflicts damage equal to half the whale’ s Hit Dice.

        Plankton - feeding whales can attack with either of their flukes(fins), Whales of 12 - 17 HD cause 1 d8 points of damage, those of 18 - 24 HD inflict 3 d8 points, and those of 24 - 36 HD cause 5 d8 points.

        Carnivorous whales can bite.Whales of 12 - 17 HD inflict 5 d4 points of damage, those of 18 - 24 HD cause 1 d4x10 points, and those of 24 - 36 HD inflict 3 d4x5 points.

        Whales are vulnerable to surface ships only when the whales are on the surface.

        Habitat / Society: Whales live in tribal gatherings called pods.They maintain strong personal and family ties.Their culture is based on complex songs that can be heard
        for miles underwater.Whales are curious about humanoids but
        if attacked they can be -
        come deadly foes.Whales rarely initiate combat.Whales are curi -
        ous about other intelligent beings.They welcome communication with other beings.They do not lie, but they may not reveal every -
            thing they know.

        Most whales feed on a variety of plankton, shrimp, and small fish that they suck up as they swim along.Sperm whales feed on larger fish, octopi, and especially giant squids.

        Whale sows normally give birth to a single calf.Twins occur in
        5 % of births.The calf remains with the sow
        for the next five to ten years, depending on the species.After five years, the sow may give birth again.The calves are protected and taught by all mem -
        bers of the pod.

        Ecology: Although they are neutral in alignment toward hu -
        manoids, their alignment toward sea life is generally lawful good.With their great size, power, and diversity, they are the masters of the sea.They preserve order through their conflicts with evilly in -
        clined sea monsters.

        Unfortunately, their relations with seafarers are less certain.Because of the value placed on parts of the whale’ s body, the crea -
        tures are hunted to excess by greedy whalers.Despite the hostility of the humanoids, whales remain curious and basically friendly toward non - whaling seafarers.

        both
        for its meat and blubber.Whales possess a stinking, yellow mass called ambergris that is valuable
        for making perfumes; they vomit this up when ill.The ambergris is worth 1 d20 x 1, 000 gp.

        Giant Whale

        Giant whales are immense versions of sperm whales, 100’ to 400’ long.In the cetacean culture, they serve functions similar to knights or barons by protecting common whales against evil sea monsters and whalers.Giant whales are attended by 2 d4 com -
        mon whales.

        Giant whales attack by biting or crushing.Whales of 18 - 25 HD inflict 1 d4x10 points of damage, those of 26 - 35 HD cause 2 d4x10 points, and those of 36 - 54 HD inflict 3 d4x10 points.The tail can deliver a crushing blow that inflicts damage equal to half the whale’ s Hit Dice.Giant whales can ram the sides of surface ships,
        delivering a crushing blow that,
        if successful, sinks the ship.They can also leap halfway out of the water and fall onto a target vessel(50 % chance of success).If successful, the ship is immediately driven under the surface.If a giant whale is facing an opponent under 20 feet long, it can swallow the target intact on an attack roll that is 4 or more greater than it needs to hit.

        Their stomachs contain large air chambers in which a victim might survive until he escapes or is digested.The stomach acid is diluted by seawater; characters or objects trapped in the stomach gain a + 1 bonus to saving throws vs.this acid.A swallowed character suffers 2 points of damage per round(1
            if the saving
            throw is successful each round) form the acid.The stomach might contain undigested possessions of previous meals.Each type of treasure has a 1 % chance per Hit Die(of the whale) of being present in the giant whale’ s gullet.There may be 1, 000 - 3, 000 coins of each type, 1 d20 gems, or 1 d4 magical items.

        The carcass of a giant whale is worth 100 gp per Hit Die.The ambergris is worth 2 d20 x 1, 000 gp.

        Leviathan

        The leviathan is an almost unimaginably immense whale, 500 to 1, 000 feet long.It is the lord of all whales and the intermediary between cetaceans and the gods.Under normal conditions, only one leviathan dwells in each ocean.The leviathan is not always active.It may hibernate
        for years on the ocean floor.During these long sleeps, the leviathan is attended and protected by its entou -
        rage of other whales.The leviathan awakens
        if summoned by the needs of other whales or in answer to a divine request.Leviathans are awesome foes with a variety of attacks.Their bite damage is determined by their Hit Dice.Leviathans of 24 - 35 HD inflict 3 d4x5 points of damage, those of 36 - 47 HD cause 3 d4x10 points,
        and those of 48 - 72 HD inflict 3 d4x15 points.The tail can deliver a crushing blow that causes damage equal to half the whale’ s Hit Dice.On an attack roll that is 4 or more greater than it needs to hit, a leviathan is capable of swallowing a target up to 80 feet long.When attacking a mass of surface vessels, the leviathan cre -
        ates a powerful wave by swimming deep, rushing to the surface,
        and leaping halfway out of the water, The resulting wave causes every ship within 500 feet to roll a saving
        throw vs.crushing blow
        and every ship between 500 and 2, 000 feet to roll a saving
        throw vs.normal blow.Ships that fail a saving
        throw immediately sink.

        Once each century, leviathans gather in arctic waters to confer and to mate.This gathering lasts six months.Each leviathan is at -
        tended by 2 d10 giant whales and 10 d10 whales of other species.

        The stomach of a leviathan contains air pockets that are capa -
        ble of sustaining a victim until he escapes or is digested.The stom -
        ach may also contain undigested possessions of previous meals or even sea vessels.Each type of treasure has a 1 % chance per Hit Die(of the whale) of being present in the giant whale’ s gullet.

        There may be 2, 000 - 6, 000 coins of each type, 5 d20 gems, or 1 d8 magical items.

        The carcass of a leviathan is worth 100 gp per Hit Die.The am -
        bergris is worth 4 d20 x 1, 000 gp.However, the killing of a levia -
        than will result in every whale within that ocean converging on the killer to avenge their lord 's death.

        Killer Whale(Orca)

        The killer whale is one of the largest predatory sea mammals.It is a deadly killer able to hold its own against all but the most power -
        ful sea monsters.A killer whale is likely to attack humanoids; it is capable of swallowing a man whole, should the need arise.

        Killer whales measure 15 to 30 feet long.Their black bodies are marked by a brilliant white belly and markings that vary from in -
        dividual to individual.

        Killer whales are not inherently hostile and do not attack unless
        hungry or provoked.There is a 20 % chance that encountered killer whales are hungry.If they are communicated with rather than attacked, killer whales may prefer to talk rather than feed.

        The killer whale 's diet consists of both fish and warm-blooded
        animals.It is a crafty hunter that can recognize the shadows and sounds made by animals atop ice floes.It will
        break through the ice to visually confirm the presence of prey.Smaller ice floes are rammed and shattered to force the prey into the water, When the killer whale smashes into the ice, every being on the ice must roll a saving
        throw vs.paralyzation.Failure means the being has
        slipped into the water and can be attacked the following round.

        When a killer whale makes a successful hit, its prey is held in its jaws where it can automatically bite each round.Victims risk drowning in two to four rounds and the loss of 1 point of Strength and Dexterity per round, due to the numbing effect of the icy wa -
        ter.When either Strength or Dexterity reaches 0, the victim dies.

        The killer whale’ s main weapon is its terrible bite.Killer whales of 9 - 10 HD inflict 4 d6 points of damage,
        while those of 11 - 12 HD cause 6 d4 points.

        When hunting larger creatures, the pod acts together to bring down prey up to 100 feet long.

        Most pods consist only of adults, but 25 % of encountered pods also have 1 d8 calves(2 - 5 HD, swim 15, bite
            for 2 d4), Adults de -
        fend their calves to the death, They also assist each other.

        Although killer whales prey on other whales, they also act as their protectors by battling other sea monsters that might deci -
        mate the entire cetacean family.Killer whales may enter into alli -
        ances with aquatic elves.

        The carcass of a killer whale is worth 100 gp per Hit Die.The ambergris is worth 1 d10 x 500 gp.

        Narwhal

        The narwhal is common to cold, subarctic waters.It is called the“ unicorn of the sea” because of the six - to 12 - foot - long spiral horn that the narwhal uses to dig into the sea floor
        for shellfish.If a narwhal is provoked, the horn can also be used like a ance to at -
        tack.When a narwhal attacks with its horn, its Hit Dice deter -
        mine the damage caused.A narwhal of 4 + 4 HD inflicts 2 d12 points of damage, one of 5 + 5 HD causes 6 d4 points, and one of 6 + 6 HD inflicts 7 d4 points.Only a male can develop this horn.A female attacks by ramming headfirst into its target, inflicting 2 d4 points of damage.

        Narwhals are basically peaceful creatures.They may serve as companions or guards
        for dolphins.They may also be trained and used by aquatic elves,

        The carcass of a narwhal is worth 100 gp per Hit Die.The ivory is worth 1 d4x10 gp.The ambergris is worth 1 d10 x 200 gp.

            Known also as the carcajou, quickhatch, and glutton, this fierce animal has been the scourge of many arctic cultures since the dawn of time.

            The wolverine is closely related to the weasel, but in habit and physiology it has much more in common with the badger.The body of a wolverine is heavyset with short, thick legs.Its claws are long and curved, making it a very dangerous hunter.The wol -
            verine’ s head is blunt and rounded with wide - set eyes and a short sharp snout.Its body has a coat of brown fur with a light stripe running down each side.Its skeleton carries the head and tail low with an arch in the back.

            Combat: When engaging in battle, the wolverine becomes a most fearsome adversary.Its great speed makes it difficult to strike(thus its decent Armor Class) and gives it a + 4 bonus on its attack roll.

            The wolverine normally attacks with a combination of its wicked claws and needle - like teeth.Its great speed enables it to strike once with each of its front claws and then follow that up with a ripping bite.

            Enemies who are behind the wolverine are subject to attack by its musk gland.Like a skunk, this animal can release an oil that is disgusting to most other life forms.This spray takes the form of a cloud 10 feet wide by 10 feet high and 30 feet long.A victim of the musk must roll a successful saving
            throw vs.poison or be blinded
            for 1 d4 hours.Even
            if the saving
            throw is successful, the victim
            instinctively draws back from the animal by half of its normal movement rate and loses 25 % of his Strength and Dexterity
            for 1 d4 turns due to nausea.Anyone who comes into the slightest contact with the wolverine’ s musk is tainted by its foul stench and is shunned by all animals until he can be thoroughly cleansed.

            Habitat / Society: Wolverines are loners that range throughout the forests of colder climates.Occasionally they are found in
            more temperate woodlands as well, Sometimes two wolverines may be encountered together, but they are almost always a mated pair that will go their own ways before long.

            Female wolverines who have mated generally give birth to one to four pups in the late winter or early spring months.These ani -
            mals are nurtured by the mother and remain with her until they










            fs







            OS

            SN











            are able to survive on their own.

            Ecology: For the most part, wolverines are carnivores that take small mammals and rodents as prey.In times when food is short,
            they feed on carrion
            if unable to make their own kills.In addition,
            wolverines are clever, adept at looting the traps set for them by men,

            In many regions where wolverines co - exist with man, they are hunted to the brink of destruction.The reasons tor this are two -
            fold, Primarily, the animals are seen as a threat and as competi -
            tors
            for small game.Secondly, the pelt of a wolverine is exceptionally resistant to cold and frost, making it very useful in
            the manufacture of winter clothing.

            Giant Wolverines

            These fiendish creatures are vicious beasts that, like their more common cousins, take whatever prey they can.Unlike common wolverines, the giants often attack human travelers.

            Creatures subjected to the creature 's musk find that it is even
            more fearsome than that of the common wolverine, Because of its more vile nature and the greater quantity released, the musk of a giant wolverine is twice as potent as normal wolverine musk.For example, the cloud formed is 20 feet by 20 feet by 60 feet and those in it may be blinded
            for 1 d8 hours.In addition to these ef -
            fects, however, the oil has several other properties that must be taken into account.The victim must retreat at full speed
            for one round, and he loses 50 % of his Strength and Dexterity
            for 1 d8 turns.All cloth items contacted by the spray rot and become use -
            less in a matter of hours(including magical cloth or parchment items that fail their saving throws vs.acid).Worm

            A constant threat to subterranean explorers, the purple worm spends its life burrowing through the earth in search of prey.Adult purple worms have been seen that are up to eight to nine feet in diameter and 140 to 150 feet long.

            Combat: The purple worm attacks by biting with its huge maw.Any roll that exceeds the required score to hit by 4 or more on the 1 d20 attack roll indicates that the victim has been swallowed whole.An adult purple worm can easily devour a creature up to eight feet tall and six feet wide.A swallowed creature will die in
            six rounds and be utterly digested in 12 turns, making it impos -
            sible to raise from the dead in any way.

            Anyone trapped inside a purple worm can attempt to escape by cutting his way out.Although the interior is considered to be AC 9, each round the worms digestive juices cause a cumulative - 1 penalty to damage the trapped victim can cause to the worm(the juices are weakening the victim).

            The worm also has a stinger on its tail, Anyone hit by the stinger suffers 2 d4 points of damage and must succeed on a saving
            throw vs.poison or be slain.

            Habitat / Society; The purple worm is a solitary creature that seeks a companion only to mate.The moment the worm hatches,
            it burrows into the ground and never sees its siblings again.

            Ecology: As the creature tunnels, it consumes large amounts of matter that it excretes when it returns to its home.Among the ma -
            terials discharged by these creatures are precious metals and gems.

            The worm is sensitive to even the most minute of vibrations in
            the earth around it and can sense prey at a range of 60 feet.

            Mottled Worm

            This is an aquatic variety of the purple worm, It inhabits shallow bottom muck but often surfaces
            for prey, It is otherwise just as a purple worm.

            Tenebrous Worm

            These natives of the demi - plane of Shadow resemble giant cater -
            pillars.In combat, they strike with their powerful mandibles and anyone bitten by the worm must roll a successful saving
            throw vs.poison, with a - 3 penalty, or suffer double damage from the toxic bite.The head and forebody are covered with poisonous bristles that inflict 1 d4 points of damage to anyone whose bare skin comes into contact with them.A successful saving
            throw vs.
            poison is required to avoid paralysis
            for 1 d4 rounds after contact.If a neutralize or slow poison spell is not administered by the end of that time, the victim dies, The chance of an attacker being hit by the spines is equal to 10 % times his base Armor Class(before shield and Dexterity modifiers).Attacking the worm’ s head re -
            duces the chance of contact by 20 % (but only one character can attack the head at a time), The mandibles of this worm are attrac -
            tive and worth from 1, 000 to 3, 000 gold pieces per set.

            Tunnel Worm

            This cousin of the giant centipede feeds on and lays its eggs in car -
            rion.A tunnel worm attacks by lunging out of its hidden burrow to strike with a + 2 bonus to the attack roll.Success indicates that the target has been seized in its mandibles, but no damage is in -
            flicted until the worm chews through the victim 's armor. This
            takes one round
            for leather or worse armor, two rounds
            for ar -
            mor tougher than leather but no tougher than chain mail, and three rounds
            for armor tougher than chain mail, Once the armor is breached, the worm inflicts an automatic 2 d8 points of damage each round.If the worm suffers 15 or points of fire damage or loses 60 % of its hit points, it will drop its victim and retreat to its lair.Tunnel worm lairs often have treasure in them from earlier victims.

                The xorn(ZORN), native to the elemental plane of Earth, feeds on precious metals deep underground.

                The wide body of a xorn is made of a pebbly stone - like mate -
                rial.Its large, powerful mouth is located on the top of its head.Three long arms, tipped with sharp talons, are symmetrically po -
                sitioned every 120 degrees around the mouth.Between the arms are large, stone - lidded eyes that permit it to see in all directions.At its base are three thick, short legs, each directly beneath an eye.The whole body is designed
                for burrowing, mouth first.

                Combat: A xorn will not attack a creature of flesh except to de -
                fend itself or its property.It can’ t digest flesh and has no excessive hate or love
                for creatures of the Prime Material plane.The sole exception to this is anybody carrying a significant amount of pre -
                cious metals or minerals, which it can smell up to 20 feet away.The normally peaceful Xorn can become quite aggressive when after food.Especially on the Prime Material plane, where such sustenance is harder to find than on its native plane.A xorn would expect to be given a reasonable portion of such stuff in ex -
                change
                for peaceful passage, or
                else attack(90 % chance) to get its
                food.

                In combat it can fight two different ways.Against a single op -
                ponent, it bends the two nearest legs deeply, angling its body 45 degrees toward the enemy.In this way all four attacks can reach him.Against several opponents it can attack with its arms in all directions, each at a different target.One of these targets suffers a second attack as the xorn angles its body down and then out at him
                for a bite.

                If necessary, a xorn can use its ability to blend into the sur -
                rounding stone to impose a - 5 penalty to opponents’ surprise rolls when it attacks.This is both a coloration blending and the physi -
                cal ability to pass into and through stone.This does not happen very often, since a xorn is more likely to ignore a party, or openly demand metals.However, once combat has been engaged, it can use a variation on this theme.Upon first taking damage, the xorn may pass through the nearest stone(usually the floor) and vanish
                for one to three rounds.It then lunges out of a stone surface to gain surprise.This is often at the feet of a character, attacking with three arms and a mouth.This kind of guerrilla warfare can
                continue indefinitely.During any round that it is passing through











                stone, a phase door spell will kill it instantly.If the fight is going against it, the xorn will pass through the nearest stone surface and retreat.

                A xorn is immune to fire and cold, both magical and normal.Electrical attacks cause half damage
                if the xorn fails its saving
                throw, and no damage
                if the saving
                throw is successful.A move
                earth spell flings a xorn back 30 feet, and the creature is stunned
                for one round.A stone to flesh or rock to mud spell lowers its AC to 8
                for one round, During that round the xorn will not attack, as it is readjusting its substance back to stone.Lastly, a passwaill spell inflicts 1 d10 + 10 points of damage.

                Habitat / Society: A xorn is normally found on the elemental plane of Earth.It is only on the Prime Material plane when forc -
                ibly summoned or the victim of an interplanar accident.

                On their native plane, xorn are peaceful creatures, comparable to a Prime Material plane herbivores.While xorn do possess in -
                    telligence, their society is limited to small clans of mineral gath -
                    erers, These clans wander from place to place, occasionally
                leaving behind open pockets where they have eaten out a vein of mineral, On the Prime Material plane they always seek wide re -
                gions of stone underground.What humans would consider trea -
                sure, xorn consider food.They keep their store of“ food” in a nearby pocket of air in the stone,

                Ecology: On the Prime Material plane, they are visitors that do
                    not serve any ecological

                function,
                On their own plane they are gatherers, eating only stone and minerals.The empty pockets in
                the stone are quickly inhabited by various creatures of the plane.Dao have been known to hunt them
                for sport.Equally as often,
                xorn serve dao as slaves.Yellow Musk Creeper & Zombie

                The yellow musk creeper is a plant that attacks humanoids,
                draining Intelligence and turning them into yellow musk zom -
                bies.The zombie serves the plant
                for a couple of months and then dies, enabling the new plant embedded in its head to feed on the body.

                The creeper is a large, light - green climbing plant with leaves like ivy, 1 d4 dark green buds, and 2 d6 flowers like those of an or -
                chid, bright yellow with splashes of purple.It can cover an area up to 20 square feet from its single bulbous root.The creeper has a sweet, entrancing odor
                while dormant.

                The zombie is a man - sized humanoid with yellow skin and a fixed, glazed look.It wears whatever it had on when taken by the creeper.A fresh zombie has no unusual odor,
                while those close to death smell strongly of creeper musk.

                Combat: The creeper is dormant unless a creature moves within 10 feet of it.When that happens, the nearest flowers turn toward the prey and attack.This attack is a puff of pollen that smells like musk and strikes the face of the victim
                if the attack roll is success -
                ful.The victim must roll a successful saving
                throw vs.spell or be
                entranced and walk into the plant.He will resist any attempt to hold him back.The round after he walks into the creeper, dozens of roots attach themselves to his head, burrowing into his brain in
                two rounds.Each round after that he loses 1 - 4 points of Intelli -
                gence as his brain is devoured.

                If the victim 's Intelligence is reduced to 1 or 2, he immediately
                becomes a yellow musk zombie under the control of the creeper.If his Intelligence is reduces to 0 or less, he dies instantly, If the plant is killed before the roots can reduce him to a zombie, Intelli -
                gence is restored at the rate of 1 point per day.A heal spell in -
                stantly restores all lost Intelligence.A zombie can be cured,
                if the mother plant is first destroyed, by casting neutralize poison and heal, one immediately after the other.It takes the victim four weeks of rest to regain all his original characteristics and levels of ability.

                When a humanoid is made into a zombie, it keeps all its hit points, but attacks as
                if it were a 2 - Hit Die monster.It keeps and uses any weapons in its hands at the time of death, but cannot cast spells or call upon magical powers.The armor is retained,
                but no bonuses due to Dexterity or Wisdom are allowed.











                The creeper can be cut back with slashing weapons, burnt, fro -
                zen, or otherwise damaged by anything that would harm a vine.However, it will eventually grow back from the main root unless this root is directly damaged.Points of damage are only recorded
                if done to the bulbous root just under the surface of the soil.Yel -
                low musk zombies are not true undead, and therefore cannot be turned by priests.Like the creeper, they are immune to charm,
                hold, illusion, sleep and other mind - affecting spells.

                Habitat / Society: The creeper is found primarily in soil areas un -
                derground, or in the depths of forests and jungles where little light strikes it.It can climb trees or rocks, like common ivy.It is occa -
                sionally planted intentionally to guard a particular area, The zombie can range up to 100 feet from the creeper.

                Ecology: The creeper attacks any creature larger than a house cat that approaches, but it can only create zombies from man -
                sized humanoids.It feeds on the bodies and on the soil in which it is planted.The bones or personal items held by those it kills are buried by the zombies close to the root.The zombie does not eat,
                being partially supported and kept alive by the seedling in its head.The creeper 's only natural enemies are disease, insects, and
                a lack of food.

                The creeper has 2 d6 flowers and 1 d4 buds.It can control one zombie
                for every two flowers.If a victim dies, a new flower opens from a bud, and a new bud appears.The zombies’ main goal is to drag creatures, particularly humanoids, into the creeper.After about two months of zombiehood, a zombie wanders at least 200 feet from the parent plant and dies.The seedling that has been growing in its head now sprouts and flowers within an hour, feeds upon the corpse, and becomes a new creeper.This creeper covers the same surface area as the prone body.



                Instructions
                for the Blank Monster Form





                When designing a monster, avoid extremes.It is a common mistake to make a monster incredibly tough
                for no reason.Re -
                ally tough monsters are very rare!If a monster has an extreme ability or combat statistic, there should be a good reason, In the same light, fit the monster 's abilities to its description.
                Players need a fair chance to anticipate what the monster might do .For example, a monster that can fly should have
                wings, or
                else usually be encountered aloft.If a monster will
                have a surprising ability, keep it to just one, and have a good reason
                for the surprise.

                Not all monsters have to be evil.There are many other rea -
                sons a monster can be dangerous without arbitrarily making it evil.For example, any creature will fight to protect its family or territory whether it is good or evil.

                Characters should be able to negoitate with or intimidate many creatures, but negotiating with a monster does not always mean giving it treasure.Most animals will put off an attack
                if tossed a free meal they can eat in peace; intelligent creatures have many different motivations.Try not to force characters into having to kill every monster they meet.If a monster is left alive after an enounter, it might be encountered again, and become a regular part of the campaign.

                CLIMATE / TERRAIN: Restrict your monsters reasonably.As a rule, only tool - making creatures can be found in every climate or every terrain.Remember that the physical design of a monster should make sense
                for the climate and the terrain.

                FREQUENCY: Monsters should not dominate the landscape unless your campaign plot requires them to.Most monsters avoid settled areas because organized groups of humans and demihu -
                mans tend to kill them.

                ORGANIZATION: Give a lot of thought to this entry; it deter -
                mines the group tendencies of the monster.A pack can be con -
                trolled by controlling its leader.A flock, on the other hand, has no leader, but it does have a pecking order.

                ACTIVITY CYCLE: Most monsters need to rest.When are they out and about ? When are they sleeping ? These habits should make sense with the diet and climate / terrain of the monster.

                DIET : What does the monster eat ? Not every monster is a man -
                eater.A wild bull is just as dangerous as a tiger, but it does not eat meat.Remember, fangs and claws imply carnivores, tusks and horns imply herbivores.

                INTELLIGENCE : Avoid the tendency to make monsters too in -
                telligent or too stupid, A creature living in the middle of the jun -
                gle with no manipulative organs is not likely to be intelligent.Really high intelligence usually implies civilization, or at least so -
                phisticated tools.On the other hand, monsters that must fight to survive must have enough intelligence or other natural ability to conquer their foes.

                TREASURE : Treasure is usually collected only by intelligent creatures.An animal type may guard a treasure
                for another crea -
                ture, but the treasure itself belongs to the intelligence that set it there as a guard.Monsters that care little
                for riches and magical items might still have some as a result of encounters, but things will be scattered and ill - kept, often rusting away to worthless -
                ness.Intelligent monsters, on the other hand, will use their magi -
                cal treasures to their best advantage— which may be no help at all to the characters!

                ALIGNMENT: _ This is a broad description of the moral and eth -
                ical tendencies of the monster, A creature of animal intelligence

                has no morals or ethics, and hence is of neutral alignment.In gen -
                eral,
                try to avoid extremes, unless these fit the monster.

                NO.APPEARING: The number of monsters typically encoun -
                tered should correspond to the other facts about the monster, A solitary monster does not travel in packs of 20!In general, carni -
                vores travel in small groups, herbivores travel in large groups.This number is also a good way to keep things balanced; weak monsters are dangerous in large numbers,
                while a strong monster all alone is easy prey to a well - organized group of heroes.

                COMBAT STATISTICS: This includes such values as Hit Dice and Armor Class.They should match the physical description of the monster.A well - designed monster fights the way it looks.A small, fuzzy creature with big, soft eyes should not have 25 Hit Dice, an Armor Class of - 8, and swoop through the air to attack.The amount of damage done should reflect the weapon being used.Avoid the tendency to give monsters excessive Hit Dice and damage capabilities.The DM is the only person who gets a kick from seeing a PC suffer 40 points of damage in one round; players don’ t find that amusing at all.

                APPEARANCE: Include in the physical description of the mon -
                ster its size, weight, color(skin, hair, eyes, etc.), smell, noises,
                type of movement(graceful walk, shambling gait, etc.), typical clothing, and preferred weapons.

                COMBAT: Include any special combat abilities or disabilities.Be sure to cover any basic strategies or tactics the monster might use.Remember, smart monsters use smart tactics.The strategies should reflect their natural advantages and disadvantages.

                HABITAT / SOCIETY: How does the monster relate to others of its kind, and to strangers ? When do they work together and when
                do they fight ? How do they choose leaders and how do these lead -
                            ers rule ? What are the goals of these monsters ? Where do they live
                            and how does this affect their behavior ? Do they use or make
                        tools ? If so, what types and how are they made ? Why does this
                    monster have treasure ? How does it get it ? What is the nature of
                the family, and how many live together ? Does the monster have special guards or allies and how frequently are they found to -
                gether ?

                ECOLOGY : This should include the types of food eaten— as well as what eats them,
                if anything.Any useful by - products should be listed, such as fur or edible parts.You may list uses
                for magical items or spells.On the other hand, don’ t turn your mon -
                ster descriptions into shopping lists.The PCs are heroes, not butchers or fur trappers.List other creatures that live in harmony with the monster or compete against it, along with information about the size and nature of its territory.

                VARIANTS : If there are major subraces, they should be de -
                tailed here.This may be a stronger leader type, an inferior ser -
                vant race, or a DM special, such as skeletons that hurl their finger joints like magic mussiles.
