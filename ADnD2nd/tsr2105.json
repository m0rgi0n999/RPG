    "Description": "<div>The anemone is a mobile, plant-like creature A voracious carnivore, it is a threat to all denizens of the sea.</div><div class='indent'>The anemone has a thick, cylindrical trunk that is ten feet in diameter and about eight feet tall.The trunk is usually bright purple, but can also be blue red, pink, or any combination of these colors The bottom of the trunk is covered with small suckers, while the top contains a toothless mouth surrounded by ten translucent tentacles, each 10-15 feet in length.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> The anemone attacks with whip-like lashes of its tentacles it makes 1d3 attacks per round, each attack consists of 1dl0 tentacle strikes. A victim struck by a tentacle suffers 1d4 points of damage and also must roll a saving throw vs. paralysis A victim succeeding on the saving roll is immune to all paralyzing and poison effects of that particular anemone. If the saving throw is unsuccessful, the victim suffers an additional 1d6 points of poison damage and becomes paralyzed for the next 3d6 rounds. During this time, the victim is unable to attack or take any other actions Should the effects of the paralysis wear off, the anemone will attack him again; if it hits the victim can again attempt a saving throw to avoid the poison and the paralysis.</div><div class='indent'>The anemone uses its tentacles to drag a paralyzed victim to its mouth, a process that takes one round to complete. it requires at least two tentacles to drag a victim; the anemone can use any free tentacles to continue attacks on other opponents The mouth leads directly to the anemone’s trunk cavity. When a victim is inside the cavity, the mouth seals shut. Tiny valves at the base of the trunk expel all of the water within the cavitv (this takes eight rounds). When the cavity is empty, it begins to refill with acidic juices secreted from glands in the base. The cavity fills with acidic juices at the rate of one foot per turn until the entire cavity is filled. Beginning on the first round of secretion, victims trapped in the cavity suffer 1d4 points of damage (no saving throw). Digestion is completed when the victim is reduced to -12 or fewer hit points, after which <i>resurrection</i> is impossible.</div><div class='indent'>Because of the confined space, victims trapped in the cavity can use only short, sharp weapons to hack themselves tree. Maximum normal damage is 1 point per round plus magical and Strength bonuses. Rescue must usually come from outside. If the anemone suffers a loss of 50% of its hit points, and all of the dam age is directed at its trunk the victim can be freed. Thrusting and stabbing weapons have a 20% chance of striking the victim trapped in the trunk. If a trapped character is freed, charactcrs on the outside have a chance of suffering damage from the acidic juice, assuming they are within ten feet of the anemone. The percentage chance of receiving damage is equal to 5% for each foot of juice in the anemone when the victim inside is freed. Characters affected by the juice suffer 1d4 points of damage. (For instance, if the cavity was filled with four feet of acidic juice when the victim inside was freed, all characters within ten feet of the anemone have a 20% chance of suffering 1d4 points of damage from the juice.)</div><div class='indent'>Each tentacle can suffer only 5 points of damage before it is Severed, assuming that the attacker is directing his attacks to the same area in order to chop it off. An anemone regenerates at the rate of 1 point per turn, and it always repairs its tentacles first. If the anemone suffers 30 or more points of damage in a single round, it withdraws all of its tentacles inside its body for 1d10 rounds and spews acidic juices in a ten-foot radius. Those within ten feet of the anemone when it spews juice have a 90% chance of suffering 1d4 points of damage; this check must be made for each round the character is exposed to the acid. When the anemone releases its tentacles, it stops spewing (for instance, if the anemone withdraws its tentacles for six rounds, it also spews juice for six rounds).</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> Anemones wander the ocean floor. They move slowly and with great effort, generally preferring to remain stationary for long periods by attaching to a rock or other solid surface. They usually travel in schools of three or more.</div><div class='indent'>Anemones are asexual, reproducing via buds which break off and grow into new anemones. Indigestible treasure items can sometimes be found beneath their trunks.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Anemones eat all species of marine life. Anemones relish humanoids, especially elves and small humans. Although most sea creatures give anemones wide berth, manta rays and small sucker fish are sometimes seen swimming among a school of anemones, as these creatures are immune to the effects of their tentacles.</div>",

The emre has a plump body covered with white feathers, a long neck, bulging blue eyes, and thick, clawed feet. The ‘wari is a bulkier version of the emre, with bronze, gold, or blue feathers. The kingfisher has a crested head, short legs, and a long, pointed bill; it is deep blue or bluish gray with a white chest. The skyfisher looks like a cross be- tween a giant bat and a vulture, black or gray in color, with long, dangling legs and a sharp beak.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> The emre, kingfisher, and ‘wari are all relatively harmless. Each can make beak attacks, and the emre and ‘wan can strike with their clawed feet. When spooked by loud noises or the odor of blood, ’waries can stampede. Those caught in the path of stampeding ‘wari suffer 3d4 points of damage per round.</div><div class='indent'>The skyfisher is the most dangerous of these birds. It can attack with either its beak or talons, but not both in the same round. It can dive for its first attack, gaining a +2 bonus to its attack roll and doubling the damage inflicted. Each time the skyfisher hits with its claws, the victim must roll a Dexterity check to try to avoid the bird’s grip. If the victim fails the check, he is carried aloft for 1d4 rounds and then dropped. Damage from the fall is 1d6 points for each round aloft. A skyfisher drops its prey if it receives 10 points of damage. It cannot lift prey in excess of 200 pounds.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> All of these birds live in flocks. They lay 2d4 eges once a year. The emre and ‘wari range over a few square miles, while the migratory kingfishers and skyfishers range over much larger areas. The intelligent skyfishers collect a variety of shiny treasure items. Kingfishers prefer gems.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Emre and ‘wari forage for insects, grams, and small rodents. These birds are favorite prey for wolves and other meateaters (‘wari are so dumb that they allow wolves to mingle among them). Kingfishers spear fish with their beaks, while skyfishers eat rabbits and other small mammals. Primitive tribes domesticate emre as mounts. Many cultures believe skyfishers are omens of war and death.</div>",

    "Description": "<div>Resembling a cross between a polar bear and a cave bear, the ice bear is a ferocious meat-eater inhabiting the southernmost regions of Krynn. It is the most intelligent of all bears.</div><div class='indent'>A mature ice bear averages 12 feet in length and weighs nearly 1,500 pounds. Its coat of dense white fur keeps it warm and makes it difficult to see against a background of ice and snow. It has a huge head, long ears, and bright blue eyes. Thick pads on its feet enable it to walk on ice without slipping. Its lean body and powerful legs enable it to swim with relative ease.</div><div class='indent'>Ice bears have no formal language, but can communicate simple ideas to each other by a system of grunts. Ice bears who have established relationships with other races are able to understand brief spoken phrases from them.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Irritable and aggressive, the ice bear is a fearsome opponent. The ice bear has excellent vision and hearing. Its sense of smell is so acute that it can sniff out prey up to 100 yards away. Because of its sharp senses, an ice bear gains a +5 bonus to its surprise roll when encountering victims.</div><div class='indent'>When attacking, the ice bear rears on its hind legs and lunges at its victim, striking with its forepaws and jaws. If the ice bear scores a paw hit with an 18 or better, it also hugs for an additional 2d6 points of damage. It continues to fight for 1d4 rounds after reaching 0 to -8 hit points. When reduced to -9 or fewer hit points, it “dies” immediately.</div><div class='indent'>The ice bear is immune to all harmful effects of cold temperatures. It is similarly immune to <i>cone of cold</i> and all other cold-based spells.</div><vr/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> Caves in icebergs serve as lairs for ice bears. Most ice bears live near arctic coastlines, but some live on small islands hundreds of miles from the mainland. Ice bears spend most of their waking hours swimming and fishing; their preferred hunting area is the edge of an ice floe where they can scoop passing fish out of the water. Ice bears seldom stray more than a few miles from their lairs.</div><div class='indent'>Every winter, a female ice bear retires to her cave and gives birth to one or two cubs. Though not as dangerous as their parents, ice bear cubs older than six months are also formidable opponents (AC 7, HD 4, THACO 17, Dmg 1d4/1d4/1d8, hugs for 1d6 points of damage). The cubs remain with their parents until they reach maturity (about seven years), then leave to establish lairs of their own.</div><div class='indent'>The ice bear has an uncanny ability to track prey over snow and ice. If no new snow has fallen, an ice bear has a 100% chance of following a trail that is one day old or less. For each day (after the first) since the trail was made, this chance is reduced by 10%. The chance is reduced by an additional 10% for each inch of snow that has fallen on the trail. (For instance, if the trail is two days old and is covered by an inch of new snow, an ice bear’s chance of following the trail is 80% .) A tracking roll is made once per day; if the roll is successful, the ice bear can follow the trail for the entire day. Otherwise, the trail is lost forever.</div><div class='indent'>Ice bears have been known to establish cooperative relationships with members of other races, including minotaurs and humans. Most commonly, ice bears establish relationships with the thanoi (also known as walrus men). The ice bears track prey for the thanoi, who then slay the quarry and share the meat with the bears. When threatened, ice bears and thanoi unite to defend themselves against common enemies. To facilitate movement over ice and snow, the thanoi have designed special sleds that can be pulled by ice bear teams.</div><div class='indent'>Though often associated with evil races, ice bears are not inherently evil themselves. Their memories are long, and they remain friendly to those who have helped them in the past, regardless of race or alignment. Characters who feed starving ice bears, free them from traps, or heal their wounds can find themselves befriended by those bears years or even decades later. Ice bears can help friends by serving as guides through hostile arctic terrain or by joining them as allies to fight off hostile creatures.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology: The ice bear mainly eats fish and seals, but any type of prey that stumbles into its path is likely to be eaten as well. Ice bear pelts can be made into warm coats, gloves, and mufflers. Some races, especially evil- and neutral-aligned humans, value ice bear claws as jewelry; a finely crafted ice bear claw necklace can fetch as much as ten stl.</div>",

    "Description": "<div>The undead beast is a mindless killer of unknown origin, compelled to destroy the living. The most common variety of undead beast is called the stahnk.</div><div class='indent'>The size of a small dragon, the stahnk’s bones protrude from rotting flesh. It has a great horned head, and its ribs are bare and barbed, forming a nasty cage. It walks on all fours, but it can rear on its hind legs, balancing with its stubby tail, to bring its powerful forearms to bear.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> The stahnk assaults anything that moves, attacking with its razor-sharp claws and horned head. Any victim struck by a claw must roll a successful saving throw vs. death magic or be flung for 1d20 additional points of damage. The beast can also charge its victims in an attempt to trample them (roll its normal attack roll). A trampled victim must roll a saving throw vs. death magic, suffering 1d8 points of damage if the roll succeeds and 3d8 points of damage if the roll fails. Additionally, a trampled victim who fails his saving throw vs. death magic must then roll a saving throw vs. wand. If he fails this saving throw, he is ensnared in the beast’s rib cage and suffers 1d4 points of damage from the barbs each round the beast moves. An ensnared character can break free from the rib cage if the beast loses 50% of its hit points (a stahnk that has already lost half of its hit points cannot ensnare victims). Victims ensnared in the rib cage can continue to attack the beast, but they do so with a -3 penalty to both attack and damage rolls.</div><div class='indent'>The stahnk can be turned by a priest as a special monster. It is unaffected by flame and suffers only minimum damage (1 point plus any applicable bonuses) from edged or pointed weapons. Blunt weapons, such as clubs and maces, affect the beast normally.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> The stahnk dwells in the most desolate regions world. It is almost always found alone, having long ago destroyed all other creatures in its immediate environment. Each stahnk claims an area of no more than a few acres as its domain. A stahnk never leaves its domain, and it kills all living creatures that trespass. Since stahnks destroy the bodies of their victims but leave the possessions untouched, they tend to accumulate sizeable treasure caches.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Stahnks do not eat their victims, but instead crush and rend them into pulp. Powerful evil wizards occasionally use stahnks as guards.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Gholor</b></div><br/><div>The gholor, also known as the feaster, is an undead beast with no hind legs or rib cage. It cannot make ensnaring, trampling, or flinging attacks. Instead, it attacks with two 20-foot-long bony hooked arms and its sharp teeth; its jaws secrete acid, causing an additional 1d8 points of acid damage with each successful bite.</div><div class='indent'>Gholors live at the bottom of deep funnel-like depressions located in deserts, on ocean floors, or in similarly desolate areas. They cannot move from their funnels. Gholors radiate a magical pull within a 1d10-mile radius of their funnels, causing all victims in the area to feel a desire to travel to the funnel. For every hour a being is within this radius, it must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell or continue to move toward the funnel at its normal movement rate. When a victim reaches the funnel, it begins to slip inside; it slips to the center and into the arms of the waiting gholor in three rounds.</div>< br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Anhkolox</b></div><br><div>About 10% of all undead beasts, including gholors, have enchanted bones that glow green. Such undead beasts are called anhkolox. These beasts are very hot: a character touching a glowing bone with his bare hands suffers 1 point of damage. If the beast is touched with any inflammable object, such as a wooden staff, the object bursts into flames.</div><div class='indent'>An anhkolox can also attack with a breath weapon, an ice-cold cone of green fire seven feet long with a base diameter of 2% feet, A victim struck by the green fire must roll a saving throw vs. spell. If he succeeds, he suffers 1d4 points of damage. If he tails, he suffers 2d4 points of damage and his bones throb inside his body for the next 1d6 turns; his AC is increased by +1 and all attack rolls suffer a -1 penalty during that period. These effects can be negated by <i>dispel magic</i> or a similar spell, though the PC still suffers the damage.</div>",

    "Description": "<div>The centaurs of Krynn are half-human and half-horse, living in secluded forests and pasture lands throughout the world.</div><div class='indent'>The chest, arms, and head of the centaur are human. The body, legs, and tail are those of a horse. The centaur is typically seven feet tall from his hooves to the top of his head, but some rare species, such as the Wendle centaur, are as small as four feet. An adult centaur can weigh as much as 1,500 pounds.<div><div>The human features of centaurs are slightly larger than those of an actual human. Their chests are broad and barrel-shaped, and their arms ripple with solid muscle. They have huge shoulders and thick necks. They wear their hair in long, flowing curls; hair colors include black, brown, blonde, red-orange, and white. They have bright eyes, usually blue or brown, but sometimes violet, green, or black. Skin tones on the human half of a centaur range from pale pink to light brown to rich ebony.</div><div class='indent'>From a human perspective, both male and female centaurs are strikingly attractive. The males are ruggedly handsome, with square jaws, aquiline noses, and full beards. Females are sleek and voluptuous, with full lips, soft cheeks, and sparkling eyes. Centaurs move with an easy grace, their steps assured and proud.</div><div class='indent'>The horse portion of the centaur’s body is covered with hair. This coat of hair grows throughout the year, becoming shaggy in the colder months, and shorter in the spring when the coat is shed, Centaur coats come in a variety of colors, including brown, blonde, black, white, and gray. Some coats are combinations of colors; white and black or brown and blonde are the most common. A shiny coat indicates a healthy centaur.</div><div class='indent'>Centaurs have long, full tails. They can twitch their tails at will, and usually do so to sweep away insects or to fan a companion.</div><div class='indent'>Centaurs do not normally wear clothing. When associating with humans, however, female centaurs wear simple cloth blouses in deference to human custom. Most centaurs carry leather or cloth bags slung over their shoulders with long straps to hold food, treasure, and other possessions.</div><div class='indent'>Centaurs speak their own language as well as common language. They speak in deep, sonorous voices. Humans find centaur speech somewhat formal and stilted; for instance, centaurs use “thou” and “thy” where humans use “you” and “your.”</div><div class='indent'>Compared to humans and demihumans, centaurs are not particularly intelligent. Nor are they especially virtuous, devoted more to their own self-interests than the common good. Centaurs are sensualists first and foremost, preferring the taste of a good wine or the warmth of a sunny day to debating philosophy or exploring new places. Soaking in a woodland stream can easily occupy an entire day.</div><div class='indent'>There are four general species of Krynn centaurs. Though all share the characteristics described earlier, as well as the social organization and combat techniques described following, each has a distinctive temperament and several distinguishing features. Each species is named for the region of its origin. The various species are by no means confined to these regions; each has been found in temperate woodlands and meadows in all corners of Krynn.</div><div class='indent'>When acentaur encounter occurs, roll 1d20 and consult the following table for the type; mixed groups are never encountered. (The DM can modify the roll for specific regions as he sees fit; for instance, Crystalmirs are more likely to be encountered in southern regions, less likely in northern regions.)</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Centaur Species Encounter Table</b><div><br/><div><table><thead><tr><th>D20 Roll</th><th>Species Encountered</th></thead><tbody><tr><td>1-13</td><td>Abanasinian</td></tr><tr><td>14-15</td><td>Crystalmir</td></tr><tr><td>16-19</td><td>Endscape</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>Wendle</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Abanasinian Centaur</b></div><br><div>The Abanasinians comprise the vast majority of Krynn centaurs; in fact, few races have seen any centaurs other than Abanasinians. These centaurs developed on the plains of Abanasinia in southern Ansalon, migrated south to the forests of Qualinesti, then quickly spread north throughout the rest of the continent. ‘Today, there are few major forests without a herd or two of these centaurs.</div><div class='indent'>The Abanasinians are the biggest and most handsome of the centaurs. All adults exceed 1,000 pounds and are at least six feet tall. They are usually a single color, such as chestnut brown, blonde, or black. Their broad backs and powerful legs enable them to gallop for long distances without tiring and also enable them to carry heavy weights; a large Abanasinian could carry three human soldiers on his back with no noticeable strain. They are extremely robust, gaining a +2 bonus to all saving throws.</div><div class='indent'>Abanasinians are superb hunters and fighters. They are playful and spirited, but they can also be quite temperamental, refusing to cooperate with their allies for a variety of minor reasons. Abanasinians remain loyal to their friends for their entire lives and hold grudges against their enemies just as long.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Crystalmir Centaur</b></div><br/><div>This variety of centaur was named for the Crystalmir Lake, located near the town of Solace in Abanasinia. Originally a subspecies of the Abanasinian centaurs, the Crystalmirs did not migrate as far as their more adventurous cousins, and today are largely confined to Ansalon’s southern forests and plains.</div><div class='indent'>The Crystalmirs are strong and sturdy, though less so than the Abanasinians. They rarely exceed 1,000 pounds in weight or six feet in height. They have lean bodies, slim necks, and high-set tails. They are usually blonde or light brown in color, with black or chestnut highlights; a few herds are solid black or white. They are extremely quick, able to gallop at a movement rate of 30 for short bursts.</div><div class='indent'>The Crystalmirs are shy and reclusive, the most reluctant combatants of all the centaurs. Their usual reaction to strangers is to run away as fast as they can. They seldom cooperate with humans or other intelligent races, refusing even to speak with them until they are completely convinced the outsiders mean them no harm.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Endscape Centaur</b></div><br/><div>The Endscapes are the most savage of the centaurs. Originally from the forests of the Endscape Peninsula north of Kern, this species is now largely confined to the northern regions of Ansalon. But since they have no permanent settlements, Endscape herds can be found just about anywhere.</div><div class='indent'>Endscapes average five to six feet tall, though their leaders are a full foot taller. Endscapes have shaggy coats and tails. The hair on their heads often grows to their waists. They are black or gray in color, occasionally brown or blonde. By human standards, Endscapes are the least attractive of the centaurs. The males have short, scraggly beards and pock-marked faces; the females have beady eyes and flabby bellies.</div><div class='indent'>What the Endscapes lack in physical beauty, they make up for in combat prowess; Endscapes get a +1 damage bonus when using melee weapons and a +2 damage bonus when kicking with their powerful hind legs.</div><div class='indent'>Endscapes are lawless creatures that attack for the sheer thrill of it, mercilessly preying on the weak and helpless. They are fond of strong wine and are frequently inebriated. Endscapes enjoy making drunken raids on human villages, burning buildings, stealing food and weapons, and generally terrorizing the populace. Male Endscapes are fascinated by human women, and have been known to kidnap them.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Wendle Centaur</b></div><br/><div>The Wendle centaurs arose in the Wendle Woods of Goodlund in eastern Ansalon. Incessant annoyance from nearby kender communities eventually drove most of the Wendles from the area, and they now populate the various forests and plains in the eastern regions of the continent.</div><div class='indent'>The Wendles average four to five feet in height. They resemble smaller versions of the Abanasinians and are sometimes mistaken for Abanasinian young. However, the Wendles are distinguished by their golden eyes and stubby tails. Instead of rib cages, Wendies have plates of solid bone, giving them an AC of 4.</div><div class='indent'>The Wendles are the smartest of all centaurs; all have a +1 modifier to their base Intelligence (meaning their Intelligence scores average 9-11). They are more interested in philosophy, history, and other intellectual pursuits than other centaurs, and they are always better sources of information. However, Wendles can be argumentative and stubborn. They are wary of strangers and seldom cooperate with them.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Except for the Endscapes, Krynn centaurs have no love of fighting, but life in the wilderness requires all centaurs to keep their combat skills sharp. Centaurs typically patrol in groups of 1d4 +2. When an enemy is engaged, half of the patrol remains in the rear to conduct missile attacks while the rest charges ahead; if the number of enemies substantially exceeds the number of centaurs, the entire patrol charges.</div><div class='indent'>Centaurs move constantly, attempting to attack their opponents from all sides. In melee, centaurs can strike twice per round—once with their weapons and once with their front hooves. They can attack enemies in back of them with their hind hooves.</div><div class='indent'>Centaurs are master archers; when using bows of any kind, they gain a +1 bonus to their attack rolls. They also favor spears, clubs, javelins, long swords, short swords, and daggers.</div><div class='indent'>Abanasinian and Endscape centaurs wield huge scythes, whose razor-sharp blades inflict 2d4 points of damage. Most centaurs carry at least two different weapons.</div><div class='indent'>Centaurs never wear armor, but centaur leaders carry shields, giving them an effective AC of 4. Wendle leaders who carry shields have an effective AC of 3.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> Centaurs live in pastures and pleasant woodlands far from human and demihuman civilizations. They have no formal lairs, thus it is easy for them to relocate; when outsiders move in or when food becomes scarce, they simply migrate to a more suitable location.</div><div class='indent'>An average herd has 2d4 males. There are twice as many females as males, and a number of young equal to the total number of adults. Female centaurs are called mares, males are called stallions, young centaurs from age one to four are called colts, and those below the age of one are called foals. Mares have 3 HD, colts have 1d3 HD, and foals have 2d4 hit points. Neither the mares, the colts, nor the foals can use weapons, though the mares can attack with their hooves.</div><div class='indent'>The strongest stallions serve as the leaders, organized into a council to make all decisions for the herd. A council must have an odd number of stallion leaders, so votes can be taken when the council cannot reach a consensus. Most councils have three members, but larger herds have five.</div><div class='indent'>Since centaurs are typically easy-going and docile, few herds have a need for a strict set of laws. Most infractions, such as minor theft, are punishable by extra hunting or guard duty. Serious crimes, such as violence against another herd member, are punishable by expulsion from the herd.</div><div class='indent'>Centaurs love treasure. Each herd has a community treasure cache, usually in a cave or beneath a pile of rocks, to which herd members are expected to contribute. Centaurs keep their personal treasure with them in leather bags or hide it in hollow trees.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Centaurs avoid contact with most other races, although they are on good terms with fellow woodland creatures, especially unicorns. They will help humans and other good races if it is in their best interests to do so. Ogres and sligs sometimes slaughter centaurs to feed their pet wolves.</div><div class='indent'>Centaurs eat all day long. They enjoy all types of ‘grasses, grains, fruits, nuts, and saplings. Centaurs rarely engage in trade, but occasionally they exchange fruits and nuts for wine and other alcoholic beverages.</div>",

    "Description": "<div>The disir are a race of deep-dwelling subterranean creatures of disgusting appearance. They stand about six to seven feet tall, although they are normally hunched over to a lesser height. Parts of their bodies are covered with a natural armor, while other areas show exposed rubbery flesh. Their skin tone is a pasty greenwhite. Their pores exude a thick coating of slimy gel. This is normally polluted with dirt, debris, and bits of dead flesh that seem to constantly slough off them. An aura of stench and decay hangs around them.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Disir usually fight with claws and bite, but they have been known to use weapons on rare occasions. Although their bite is more effective, disir prefer to fight with their claws whenever possible, saving their bite attack for helpless or nearly helpless victims. The claws are long and powerful and the disir are able to easily crush soft stones with one hand. Their bite is particularly vicious, both for their protruding jagged tangs and their long, razor-sharp, rasp-like tongue. This is used to shear flesh from bone.</div><div class='indent'>All the attacks of the disir (claws and bite) are poisonous, due to the slimy jelly that drips from their bodies. This jelly causes intense pain to (but does not kill) its victims. Those struck by a disir must roll a saving throw vs. poison at the end of the round. Only one saving throw need be made, regardless of the number of times the character has been hit. Each claw causes a -1 penaltv to the saving throw, while a bite gives a -2 penalty. These modifiers are cumulative, so if a character is struck by all three attacks, he would have a total penalty of -4 to his saving throw.</div><div class='indent'>If the saving throw is failed, the poison generates a burning fire, starting from the point of the wound. This pain is so intense that it numbs the muscles and gradually paralyzes the victim. The process takes 1d4 +1 rounds. Each round until the character is paralyzed, he suffers a -1 (cumulative) penalty to his THAC0. This penalty is removed when the pain is neutralized. The poison has a duration of Id4 turns. The poisonous gel has a very short life when exposed to air. It is effective on the disir because their bodies are constantly renewing it. However, it cannot be bottled or kept and used by others.</div><div class='indent'>The gel also provides protection from fire-based attacks Disir gain a +4 saving throw bonus and suffer 1 point less per die of damage from fire-based attack?</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> The disir are a secretive group, due in part to geographic location (miles beneath the earth) and a fanatical hatred of anything that might be their neighbor. Their homeland is deep under the earth in the realm of the Underdark. There, they fashion underground tunnels or, more often appropriate the homes of others. Thus they are a scourge to dwarves and other tunneling races Wars between the two are often fought over the homes the dwarves have built.</div><divThe disir live in large tribal units of 50 or more members The tribes, in turn maintain close relations with each other and several tribes may be located in a limited area Warfare between different tribes is unknown. They are not so scrupulous about other neighbors, viewing any other settlement as a source of food. Although highly intelligent, they do not enter into treaties or truces of any kind.</div><div class='indent'>The disir reproduce from eggs. There are no distinguishing signs of their sex, making it impossible to tell male from female by sight Indeed, a single disir may be either male or female, depending on what stage of life it is in. The females of their kind (or those in the female phase) dominate the males.</div><div class='indent'>The tribes live communally sharing the duties between all the adult members. The eggs are laid in Incubator halls and are guarded at all times. Food gathering and raiding is done in groups and the spoils of each are brought back to the tribe and divided among all the members. Those who cannot assist in these tasks, for whatever reason are killed.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> The disir, while omnivorous, greatly favor meat—of any kind They seem untroubled by spoilage decay or source. They eat anything they can kill or any dead they find They resort to vegetable matter (mostly fungus only, when other resources have dried up. Thus they often serve to scour old overpopulated sections of the Underdark, leaving behind sterile dead remains.</div>",

    "Description": "<div>The traag draconians are among the first failed attempts to create draconians, a precursor of the more successful baaz. While not overly tall, they are emaciated and gangly. They have sharp taloned hands, and crocodile-like snouts. Their bodies are covered with rough scales of a metallic brass color, a link to their heritage.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Traag draconians are fierce fighters, adept with either weapons or their natural talons. At the same time, they are not naturally courageous, being extremely conscious, even paranoid, of their- own weaknesses and numbers. They do not attack unless the odds are in their favor, either through numbers, the element of surprise or clever strategies, or if they have been forced into battle. Thus, their initial morale is only 8.<div><div>Once the battle is joined, however, the traag become maniacally fearless. A blood-lust seizes them and they no longer need to check morale for the duration of the fight. They will fight without regard for losses and gain a +1 on all saving throws vs. spells that cause fear (scare, fear, etc.). This effect only comes into play when the combat is actually joined. Since the traag don’t use missile weapons, this is when hand-to-hand combat is conducted.</div><div class='indent'>In combat, the traag often disdain the use of weapons and fight with their claws, which are effective enough. They use weapons when there is some advantage to be gained from using the weapon-attack mode, reach, or other special use.</div><div class='indent'>Upon death, the traag bubble and rot away in a single round, leaving only a slimy puddle behind.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> The traag were one of the first products of the lords’ attempts to pervert the eggs of the good dragons to create araconians. (At least, they were one of the first experiments to survive.) For a time, since they lived and were good fighters (when they fought), the lords considered them a success and bred large numbers of them.</div><div class='indent'>Over time, however, the traag began to develop a number of undesirable traits that ultimately made them unsuitable for use in the dragon armies. Most obvious of these is their noteworthy cowardice. Even this alone would not have been sufficient, but coupled with a very low birth rate (each brass dragon egg yielded only a few viable traag) and a tendency to suddenly go berserk, attacking anything or anyone, made the traag a failure. Not wanting to waste time slaughtering them by the thousands, the evil lords simply disposed of their error in the lands of Aurim.</div><div class='indent'>The traag have formed themselves into small tribal bands. Each tribe is led by a chieftain (5 HD, THACO 15, Dmg 1d8/1d8). These bands of 1d100 + 50 traag live mostly in the deserted villages and cities of ancient Aurim The more numerous and powerful hobgoblins have made the plains unsafe for their habitation, so the traag have for tified and trapped the ruins as a protection against their powerful neighbors. The old streets are honeycombed with hidden sally ports, rockfalls, dead ends, and concealed ways.</div><div class='indent'>The villages are normally organized in a similar manner. At the center of the rums is the tribal headquarters. There are always at least two paths to this and sometimes more. Fanning out from the center are different encampments, or “divislons” as the traag call them. Each division has 1d20 + 10 members. These divisions have varying responsibilities, usually assigned the duty of guarding a specific post or hunting in a given territory.</div><div class='indent'>Because the traag are created, they have only one sex (male for lack of a better name). There are no young or dependents. All members of the tribe are warriors—they are more completely mobilized than any other group in Taladas. This has led them to Increasing dominance in Aurim.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Although carnivorous, the traag are often reduced to scavenging. Unwilling to hunt for great lengths of time on the plains, they are almost universally under-nourished. It’s not surprising then that they will eat virtually anything (even hobgoblin) that is put in front of them.</div",

    "Description": "<div>Derived from the eggs of gold dragons, Auraks are the most powerful and devious of the draconians. Soft-spoken and coldblooded, no act of violence is too extreme for an Aurak.</div><div class='indent'>Auraks are seven-foot-tall, sinewy draconians with short tails and golden scales. Small spines grow from the backs of their heads They have long, sharp teeth and bulging eyes that are either blood red, green, or black. Their bodies emit a noxious sulphur odor, detectable from several yards away. They wear few clothes, aside from the occasional belt or cape. Auraks are the only wingless draconians.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Auraks experience the agony of their victims as an alphysical pleasure. But they are not impulsive fighters-they strike only after careful planning has minimized all of the risks. Auraks have several natural defenses to frustrate their opponents. They can become <i>invisible</i> at will until they attack. They can <i>polymorph</i> into any animal their size, three times per day. They can also change self three times per day to perfectly imitate any human or humanoid they have ever seen; this effect lasts for 2d6 +6 rounds. The heightened senses of Auraks give them  infravision to 60 feet, and the ability to detect <i>hidden</i> and <i>invisible</i> creatures within 40 feet. Auraks can also see through all illusions.</div><div class='indent'>Though Auraks cannot fly, they move as fast as other draconians on the ground. They also have the ability to cast a dimension door spell three times per day at a range of 60 yards.</div><div class='indent'>Auraks have three modes of attack. First, they can generate an energy blast from each hand, causing 1d8 +2 points of damage at targets up to 60 yards away. When using their <i>change self</i> ability, they appear to be using a weapon appropriate to the character they are copying, but they are actually attacking with energy blasts. Second, they can exhale a noxious sulphur cloud five feet in diameter three times per day. Victims caught in the cloud suffer 2d10 points of damage and are blinded for 1d4 rounds (a successful saving throw means half damage and no blindness). Third, Auraks can attack with claws and fangs (1d4/1d4/1d6), though such attacks are seldom used.</div><div class='indent'>Once per day, Auraks can cast two wizard spells of 1st to 4th level. Preferred spells include <i>enlarge</i>, <i>shocking grasp</i>, <i>ESP</i>, <i>stinking cloud</i>, <i>blink</i>, <i>lightning bolt</i>, <i>fire shield</i>, and <i>wall of fire</i>.</div><div class='indent'>Auraks gain a +4 bonus to all saving throws.</div><div class='indent'>An Aurak’s most insidious power is that of mind control. Once per day, it can mind control one creature of equal or fewer Hit Dice for 2d6 rounds. This ability enables the caster to control the actions of the victim as if it were its own body. The victim can avoid the effects of this ability by rolling a successful saving throw vs. spell. If an Aurak concentrates for a full turn, taking no other actions, it can use its suggestion ability; there is no limit to the number of times an Aurak can use this ability.</div><div class='indent'>When an Aurak reaches 0 hit points, it does not die, but instead surrounds itself with green flames and enters a fighting frenzy (+2 bonus to attack and damage rolls). Anyone coming within three feet of the flames suffers Id6 points of damage, unless a saving throw vs. petrification is successful. Six rounds later, or when the Aurak reaches -20 hit points, it transforms into a spinning ball of lightning, striking once per round as a 13-HD monster to cause 2d6 points of damage. Three rounds later, it explodes, stunning all within ten feet for 1d4 rounds (2d4 rounds if underwater), Those within ten feet also suffer 3d6 points of damage (no saving throw). Items within the range of the explosion must roll successful saving throws vs. crushing blow or be destroyed.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> Because of their superior strength and exceptional abilities, Auraks are easily adaptable to all environments, though they prefer secluded areas. Auraks live alone or in pairs; larger groups of Auraks are never encountered. Auraks collect treasures as souvenirs of their kills; the value of treasure has little meaning for most Auraks.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Auraks have an almost compulsive need to kill; most intelligent races, including other draconians, have learned to avoid them. There are no limits to what an Aurak will eat, though they prefer pearls and small gems. Auraks will consume alcohol, but they are less interested in strong drink than other draconians.</div>",

Their eyes are blood red, and they have slightly stooped shoulders. Their fangs are somewhat shorter than those of other draconian races.</div><div class='indent'>Baaz so enjoyed the regal dress of the Dragonarmies that many of them continue to wear it today. Leather collars and breastplates studded with iron are common, as are layered metal leggings. Since this apparel is poorly kept, it is primarily for decoration, offering little in the way of protection.</div><div class='indent'>Baaz are often encountered in disguise. They conceal their wings under long dark robes and hide their features with large hoods and masks. Such outfits enable them to pass through civilized lands unnoticed.</div><div class='indent'>At the bottom of the draconian social order, Baaz tend to be chaotic in nature and self-serving when they can get away with it. During the War of the Lance, they served as common foot soldiers and were routinely assigned the most dangerous and least appealing duties. Their superior officers, along with members other draconian races, made no effort to conceal their contempt for the Baaz, humiliating them at every opportunity. The Baaz deeply resented this treatment, a feeling that still lingers.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Baaz are cruel and sadistic fighters, especially when drunk. They can attack twice in a round with their sharp claws; they can also use their fangs instead of one of the claw attacks (the bite also causes Id4 points of damage), but they prefer their claws. Baaz use short swords, daggers, and other easily concealed weapons; when concealment is not important, they use long swords and spears. They fight viciously and brutally, aiming their attacks at their opponents’ heads and eyes. Alcohol has no significant affect on their ability to fight; if anything, it makes them all the more vicious. If alcohol is available, Baaz always drink before fighting. Drunken Baaz always fight to the death.</div><div class='indent'>It possible, Baaz attempt to ambush their victims by dressing in masks and heavy robes, passing themselves off as harmless humanoids. When their victims are off-guard, the Baaz leader draws his weapon and attacks, screaming for his comrades to do the same. While fighting in their robes, Baaz are limited to a movement rate of 6. After combat is initiated, a Baaz can tear off its robe instead of attacking.</div><div class='indent'>When a Baaz reaches 0 hit points, it turns into a stone statue. The person who struck the death blow must roll a successtul Dexterity Check with a -3 penalty or his weapon is stuck in the statue. The statue crumbles to dust within ld4 rounds, freeing the weapon. The weapons and armor of the Baaz remain behind after it turns to dust.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> Bands of Baaz lair in abandoned buildings of all kinds. Because of their talents in disguising themselves, they sometimes live unnoticed in abandoned buildings in the center of human settlements. Baaz have a particular affinity for deserted inns and taverns.</div><div class='indent'>Baaz live lawless, disorderly lives, utterly lacking in selfdiscipline. They regularly engage in drunken raids and random acts of vandalism. Baaz love treasure of all kinds, but they particularly covet brass dragon eggs, believing that the eggs can one day be corrupted to create more Baaz. The magical techniques to create new draconians are hopelessly beyond the meager abilities of the Baaz, but they continue to accumulate the precious eggs, just in case.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Because the Baaz were responsible for more human deaths during the War of the Lance than any other draconian race, humans hunt them mercilessly. Since the end of the war, the Baaz have won grudging acceptance from other draconians, but relations are strained; the Baaz and the Kapaks, for instance, remain bitter enemies.</div><div class='indent'>Baaz can eat virtually anything, including minerals, carrion, and human flesh.

Not only can it glide like other winged draconians, it can sustain the glide indefinitely in a strong wind. On cold days, Bozaks spread their wings to increase exposure to the sunlight. On warm days, they slowly flap their wings to generate cooling breezes. When Bozaks are anxious or lost in thought, their wings twitch and vibrate.</div><div class='indent'>Bozaks are intensely spiritual, devoted to the worship of Takhisis, the Queen of Darkness. They conduct elaborate ceremonies in her honor.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Bozaks are cautious and devious fighters When possible, they strike from a distance with spells or missile weapons, then charge for melee attacks. A favorite tactic of Bozaks is to charge a victim on all fours, flapping their wings and hissing while clutching swords or other weapons between their teeth. So disconcerting is this sight that the victims are often too startled to take action before the Bozaks are on them.</div><div class='indent'>Bozaks never show mercy once they attack. However, they do not destroy an opponent if they believe their cause can be advanced by sparing the life.</div><div class='indent'>Like Baaz, Bozaks can make two claw attacks per round, or one claw attack and a bite attack (the bite causes 1d4 points of damage). Favored weapons of the Bozaks are short swords, daggers, or any other weapon that they can carry in their mouths while running. Most. Bozaks carry a long bow in addition to a melee weapon.</div><div class='indent'>Bozaks are magic wielders and can cast spells as 4th-level wizards. Among their preferred spells are <i>burning hands</i>, <i>enlarge</i>, <i>magic missile</i>, <i>shocking grasp</i>, <i>invisibility</i>, <i>stinking cloud</i>, and <i>web</i>.</div><div class='indent'>Bozaks gain a +2 bonus to all saving throws.</div><div class='indent'>When a Bozak reaches 0 hit points, its scaly flesh shrivels and crumbles from its bones in a cloud of dust; this process takes one round. In the next round, the bones explode, causing 1d6 points of damage to all within ten feet (no saving throw)</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> Bozaks prefer to live in secluded forests where they can conduct their religious ceremonies undisturbed. Unlike other draconians, Bozaks construct their own lairs, usually small huts of wood and stone with flat roots, wooden doors, and small openings in the walls for windows. They use large rocks and tree stumps for furniture, and line the floors with soft layers of weeds and twigs.</div><div class='indent'>A Bozak band usually contains 2d10 members, but bands larger than six are rarely encountered. The strongest Bozak serves as the band’s leader. In addition to making all the decisions for the band, the leader conducts their religious ceremonies.</div><divMost Bozak lairs have a simple shrine to Takhisis where the band conducts regular services. A typical shrine is a crude idol in the shape of a dragon made of stones and small trees lashed together with vines. The idol, seldom more than a few feet tall, is centered in an open held where all of the vegetation has been scorched black. A circle of charred bones surrounds the shrine. It is here the Bozaks offer prayers to Takhisis and conduct their rituals in her honor.</div><div class='indent'>Bozaks prefer gems and jewelry to all other treasure, and often decorate their shrines with them.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Though utterly convinced of their superiority, Bozaks feign friendship with other draconian races if it serves their purposes (the gullible Baaz are often exploited by the Bozaks in this way). Bozaks frequently raid human settlements for prisoners. Their diet consists mainly of vegetable matter, carrion, and small mammals.</div",

    "Description": "<div>* This movement rate applies when the draconian is running on all fours, flapping its wings.</div><br/><div>Kapaks are a race of venomous draconians known for their stealth. They are derived from copper dragon eggs.</div><div class='indent'>Kapaks average six feet tall and have sleek torsos and long limbs. Their scales are dull copper tinged with green, their eyes are orange or dark brown. They have short manes of dark brown or blonde hair hanging from either side of their mouths. Soft pads line the bottoms of their feet, enabling them to move silently. They speak in a soft, high-pitched whine.</div><div class='indent'>The most exotic physical feature of the Kapaks are the poison glands located under their tongues that continuously secrete a venomous spittle. The glands are magical in nature, and are capable of producing a virtually limitless amount of the thick, yellowish venom.</div><div class='indent'>Kapaks avoid any style of clothing that might draw attention to themselves.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Though their intelligence is limited, Kapaks are superb fighters, fiendishly clever in their ability to catch victims offguard and take advantage of opponents’ weaknesses. Kapaks rarely attack unless their opponents are at some sort of disadvantage. Because of their cunning, Kapaks make excellent assassins.</div><div class='indent'>Most (70%) Kapaks have the following abilities: move silently (base chance of 15%), hide in shadows (base chance of 10%), and find/remove traps (base chance of base chance of 20%). A few (10%) have these abilities at a higher level. To determine the level of the more skilled Kapaks, roll 1d6 and multiply the result by 5; this gives the percentage increase (above the base) in each skill. (For instance, a roll of 4 indicates a 20% increase over the listed chances.)</div><div class='indent'>Kapaks can bite for 1d4 points of damage, but they prefer to use weapons such as short swords, daggers, slings, bows, maces, and broad swords. Kapaks often lick their weapons before engaging in combat to coat them with venom. Victims bitten by a Kapak or struck by a venom-coated weapon must roll a successful saving throw vs. poison or become paralyzed for 2d6 turns. The poison evaporates from a weapon in three rounds; it takes a Kapak one full round to poison a weapon again after the previous coating has evaporated (they can do this even while engaged in melee).</div><div class='indent'>Kapak frequently wear leather or scale mail armor. Leather armor reduces their AC to 2, while scale mail reduces it to 1. If a shield is carried, the AC is reduced by another point. Because of their strength, wearing armor does not significantly reduce the Kapaks’ ability to move.</div><div class='indent'>When a Kapak reaches 0 hit points, its body instantly dissolves into a ten-foot-wide pool of acid. All within the pool suffer 1d8 points of damage per round from the acid (no saving throw). The acid evaporates in 1d6 rounds. All items possessed by the dissolved Kapak, including treasure and magical items, are rendered useless by the acid.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> Kapaks are not builders. Kapak bands occupy abandoned buildings throughout Krynn, primarily in mountain ranges near civilized regions. Towers and castles are favorite Kapak strongholds.</div><div class='indent'>Kapaks seldom have formal leaders, making most decisions by consensus. When disagreements cannot be resolved, a Kapak is just as likely to leave the group as he is to fight for the acceptance of his opinion. Kapaks have great respect for Auraks, and often allow them to serve as their leaders.</div><div class='indent'>A Kapak band has a common treasure cache; individuals seldom keep more than a few coins for themselves. When a Kapak leaves the band, he takes his share of the group’s treasure with him, using it to buy his way into a new band.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Kapaks are larger than Baaz and often bully and abuse their smaller cousins. Consequently, the Baaz hate the Kapaks as much as they do any non-dracoman race. Violent confrontations are common between Baaz and Kapaks. Aside from the Baaz, the Kapaks maintain good relations with other evil races, often hiring themselves out as mercenaries and assassins. Hundreds of Kapaks survived the War of the Lance, and they continue to serve in the remaining Dragonarmies that exist throughout central Ansalon.</div><div class='indent'>Kapaks are strictly carnivorous. Because of their extremely high metabolisms, Kapaks must devour at least 20 pounds of meat per day. They eat fish, wild game, and defeated opponents.</div>",

    "Description": "<div>* This movement rate applies when the draconian is running on all fours, flapping its wings.</div><br/><div>Sivaks are savage, shapechanging draconians that are derived from the eggs of silver dragons. They are among the most powerful draconians, second only to Auraks.</div><div class='indent'>Sivaks have gleaming sliver scales and black eyes. Topping nine feet in height, they are the largest draconian race. They emit a mild odor that smells ilke hot metal and smoke. Sivaks seldom wear armor, but they sometimes wear flowing capes and decorative metal bands around their arms, legs, necks, and tails.</div><div class='indent'>Sivaks can run and glide like most other draconian races, but they are unique in their ability to fly. They are extremely agile in the air, as maneuverable as dragons and nearly as fast.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Like most draconians, Sivaks relish the suffering of but Sivaks are particularly nasty, no victim is too small or too weak to be victimized by a Sivaks. Sivaks work especially well in teams defending one another against unexpected attacks and surrounding opponents to assault them from all sides. Sivaks do not fight carelessly. Unless ordered by a strong leader, they do not go into battle when the odds are stacked against them, nor do they venture into an area where an ambush is possible. They refuse to fight to the death, flying to safety if a battle turns against them.</div><div class='indent'>The Sivaks’ movement flexibility gives them an important tactical advantage. They can race forward on all fours, silently glide from a height, or attack from the air. Many opponents are unfamiliar with the existence of flying draconians, glving the Sivaks the additional advantage of surprise—for instance, a Sivak chdrging on all fours can suddenly take to the air and swoop at its opponent from behind.</div><div class='indent'>Sivaks are also powerful shapechangers. When a Sivak slays a humanoid of its size or smaller, it can take the form of the victim. It does not gain the memories, experiences, or spell use of its victim and, like all draconians, it contniues to radiate magic, but its appearance and voice are exact matches to those of the victim. A Sivak can remain in this new form as long as it wishes. A Sivak can change back to its normal form at any time. but cannot shapechange again until it kills another victim.</div><div class='indent'>Sivaks use their shapechanging ability to explore or spy in lands hostile to draconians. A shapechanged Sivak can penetrate deep into a enemy stronghold, or it can secretly observe humanoid enemies. A shapechanged Sivak can kidnap an opponent, destroy him, then shapechange to the form of this victim.</div><div class='indent'>Sivaks attack with both claws for 1d6 points of damdge each and with their long, heavy tails for 2d6 points of damage (the tails can strike opponents on any side). They also use a variety of weapons, including long swords, two-handed swords, battle axes, and spears. A favorite weapon is a Sivak-designed sword with barbed notches on each edge: this weapon causes 1d10 points of damage. Sivaks also use magical weapons whenever available.</div><div class='indent'>Sivaks gain a +2 bonus to all saving throws.</div><div class='indent'>What happens to a Sivak when it reaches 0 hit points depends on the size of its slayer. If the slayer was a humanoid the same size as or smaller than the Sivak, the slain Sivak shapechanges into the form of its slayer. It remains in its death shape for three days. after which time it decomposes into black soot. It the slayer was not a humanoid or if it was a humanoid larger than the Sivak, the Sivak immediately bursts into flame upon reaching 0 hp, causing 2d4 points of damage to all within ten feet (no saving throw).</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> Sivak bands usually can be found in secluded mountain caves. Sivaks are not particularly ambitious. They make decisions by consensus and spend most of their time waylaying travelers. They enjoy all types of gambling, wagering money, food, alcohol, or prisoners on endless card and dice games. They welcome any opportunity to steal magical items and are also fond of gems and jewelry.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Sivaks are distrustful of other draconian races and generally avoid them. They sometimes ally with a powerful Aurak leader or join with a Kapak band tar some recreational slaughter of the Baar. Sivaks are tend of strong drink, but like the Baaz, alcohol has no significant effect on their ability to fight. Sivaks eat virtually anything, and have a special fondness for elven flesh.</div>",

Additionally, amphi dragons can communicate with any human or demihuman race.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> The amphi dragon cannot fly, and it moves only awkwardly on land. However, on land it can leap a horizontal distance of 18 feet or a vertical distance of six feet once every other round. It cannot move on the round following a leap.</div><div class='indent'>The amphi dragon generally avoids the land, however, preferring to nestle itself in the mud of the ocean floor and wait for victims. It attacks with little or no provocation, and creatures of any size are potential victims. It uses its breath weapon first, then closes for fore claw and bite attacks. It attempts tongue strikes at solitary opponents, particularly ones smaller than itself. The amphi dragon may intentionally prolong its attacks to savor the death throes of a doomed victim.</div><div class='indent'>Breath Weapon and Special Abilities: An amphi dragon’s breath weapon is a stream of acid 60 feet long and three feet wide. Damage caused by the breath weapon varies with the dragon’s age (see earlier table). Victims caught in the blast must roll saving throws vs. breath weapon, with success indicating half damage. The breath weapon is equally effective underwater and in the open air and can be used once every three combat rounds.</div><div class='indent'>From birth, the amphi dragon can breathe both water and air. It can change the color of its skin to match the surroundings. If it remains stationary while camouflaged, it is undetectable 80% of the time.</div><div class='indent'>The amphi dragon’s warts continually ooze acid. Each time a character attacks the dragon in melee, he must roll a Dexterity check. If he fails, he suffers 1d6 points of damage.</div><div class='indent'>The amphi dragon can attempt a tongue strike, up to a distance of two feet times its age category, to capture a victim. If the amphi dragon succeeds in an attack roll against AC 10, the victim is stuck to its tongue and is pulled to its mouth at the end of the round. If the tongue suffers 12 or more points of damage, the amphi dragon releases its prey. Otherwise, the victim is automatically bitten in each subsequent round. When the victim is reduced to 0 hit points, the amphi dragon swallows it on the next round.</div><div class='indent'>As they age, amphi dragons gain the following additional abilities, useable once per day:</div><br/><div><table><tr><td>Adult:</td><td><i>detect magic</i></td></tr><tr><td>Old:</td><td><i>suggestion</i></td></tr><tr><td>Wyrm:</td><td><i>darkness, 15’ radius</i></td></tr></table></div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> Too lazy to construct elaborate lairs, amphi dragons live in sunken ships or empty underwater caves.

See text for details.</div><br/><div>“Astral dragon” is a general term for a race of ancient golden dragons to whom all dragons of Krynn can trace a common ancestry. The immortal astral dragons are the personification of neutrality in dragons.</div><div class='indent'>Among the first dragons ever created by the gods were two astral dragons named Deion and Procene. These dragons were directcd to give birth to a race of dragons that the gods would adopt as their own. Selected newborns were taken from their parents and transformed to reflect the personalties and philosophies of the gods who adopted them. Thus were created early archetypes of black, red, gold, silver, and other dragons. Deion and Procene remained neutral, in exchange for their offspring, the gods pledged to leave them alone.</div><div class='indent'>When the couple grew weary of the constant tension between the good and evil dragons, they appealed to the gods to be relieved of their obligations on Krynn. The gods granted their wish, and relocated them to an alternate plane of existence in the Abyss. In time, Deion and Procene gave birth to new generations of neutral dragons.</div><div class='indent'>An unmated astral dragon is dull yellow in color and about five feet long with human hands and long, slim fingers. It has huge black eyes. and its scales are covered with fine blond fur. Though a hatchling is slightly less formidable (AC 4, HD 2), an astral dragon does not progress through the various age categories as do other dragons; its statistics do not change significantly until it becomes part of a mated pair.</div><div class='indent'>When an astral dragon finds a suitable mate, the couple appeals to the gods of neutrality to sanction their union. If approval is granted, the mated astral dragons undergo a remarkable transformation. To symbolize the union, the gods create a 100-foot golden chain, each end of which encircles the mates’ necks to link them for all eternity. The mates grow to a length of 50 feet and become enveloped in a permanent aura of golden light. Their intelligence and abilities increase to god-like levels.</div><div class='indent'>Thereafter, the couple lives. tights, works, and plays as a unit. If the chain is broken and the mates are separated by a distance of at least 100 yards for 30 days, they will revert to their original, weaker forms; however, it requires the power of a wish spell or its equivalent to break the chain.</div><div class='indent'>Astral dragons speak their own tongue as well as the languages of good and evil dragons. All astral dragons have the ability to communicate with any intelligent creature.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Unmated astral dragons are incapable of performing snatch, kick, wing buffet, or tail slap attacks. Though they have the special senses of a dragon (as per the very young age category), they do not radiate fear. They can defend themselves with their claws and teeth, but they are sluggish combatants, always attempting to flee instead of engaging in melee. They are essentially immortal, as they instantly recover all lost hit points. However, they can be destroyed by power word, kill, wish, or similar spells.</div><div class='indent'>Mated astral dragons attack as a unit. Though capable of performing snatch, kick, wing buffet, and tail slap attacks, as well as vicious attacks with their teeth and claws, they prefer to use spells to frighten away their enemies.</div><div class='indent'>Mated astral dragons gain the abilities of a 35th-level cleric. They have the special senses of a dragon (as per the great wyrm age category). They radiate fear in a radius of 50 feet (-4 penalty to saving throw) and have a bonus of +12 to their attack and damage rolls. Like unmated astral dragons, they are essentially immortal, instantly recovering all lost hit points; nothing less than the power of a wish, power word, kill, or similar spells can destroy them.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> Astral dragons live in immense keeps of black crystal built for them by the gods. They rarely leave their keeps and never voluntarily leave the Abyss. A mated pair must petition the gods for permission to give birth, a request seldom granted in order to limit the population. Upon reaching the age of five, a young astral dragon is dispatched from his parents’ keep to fend for himself.

It is a furry dragon about the size of a small house cat.</div><div class='indent'>At first glance the kodragon appears to be a large bat, but only for a moment It iS shaped like a dragon, with four spindly legs, a long sinuous neck, etc. However it has a fine gray fur instead of scales. It has bare, leathery wings, like those of a bat. Its face has a blunt snout and large, luminous black eyes. Its tail is furred all the way down to the tip, where it iS bare and pointed. The fore claws of a kodragon have opposable thumbs, like those of a human.</div><div class='indent'>Kodragons speak in light, hissing voices; they speak human languages fluently. Their voices sound like those of children.</div><div class='indent'>These miniature dragons have a delicate, musky odor, completely different from any mammal.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> These small creatures avoid combat whenever possible. If cornered or angered, they can fight with their two front claws and a bite. Their strategy is to stay aloft and attack the backsides and hard-to-defend parts of their enemies. They can dart from front to back, between the legs, and under the arms of an opponent. This makes them very tough to hit. When executing such aerial maneuvers, they get a -2 bonus to their Armor Class and a +2 penalty to their attack rolls.</div><div class='indent'>They have two magical breath weapons. Both form ten-footdiameter clouds One breath weapon iS a shrinking gas; the other cancels the effects of any kodragon’s shrinking gas (it does not work to cancel other means of shrinking). The shrinking gas reduces its victims to 5% of their original size. A successful saving throw vs. breath weapon means that the victim leapt out of the way in time.</div><div class='indent'>Kodragons can teleport without error once per round. This can be used in combat, but they don’t like to do that. They would prefer to fly instead However, this is their primary defense. These small dragons teleport out of harm’s way if there is any serious dagger. The plane shift ability is used to travel in a more leisurely fashion, but it can also be used to escape a bad situation.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> The natural home of kodragons is the plane of the Astral Dragon. This plane is one of the layers of the Abyss that has been converted to absolute neutrality by the gods of Krynn. It is physically similar to the world of Krynn. One quirk is that creatures can swim through the air simply by willing it.</div><div class='indent'>Kodragons are lovers of art and knowledge. They do not use tools or weapons, except for a special tablet and stylus that they use to record histories and make other records. There is no unified culture of kodragons. Each wanders as he sees fit and records those things he feels are important. There are great shared repositories of these clay tablets. Older kodragons whose wanderlust has faded maintain these secret libraries.</div><div class='indent'>Kodragons do not lay eggs but rather give live birth to their children, Like marsupials, they have a pouch on their stomachs where the infants are kept and raised in safety. When not being used for child rearing, this pouch holds their tablets and styluses. It operates as a bag of holding, and therefore can hold much more than its size would indicate. Child rearing is done by the female. The father visits only occasionally, spending most of his time on other tasks.</div><div class='indent'>By nature these diminutive dragons are inquisitive and talkative. They are always poking around, sometimes so much that they get into trouble. Their keen verbal skills and meticulous record keeping have made them ideal emissaries for the Astral Dragon.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> There are no natural predators for the kodragon. Catching one is so difficult, and the resulting meal so meager, that a species would die out before surviving off of them. A gland in their neck can be used to make potions of shrinking.</div><div class='indent'>Kodragons can drink any liquid to sustain themselves. Anything from water or wine to hemlock or mercury can sustain them. They need to consume their own body weight in fluids each day.</div>",

A thick shell, usually black or dark green, covers most of its body. Its webbed toes and paddlelike flippers make land travel difficult. The sea dragon has no teeth.</div><div class='indent'>Sea dragons speak their own tongue, and also the languages of fishes and evil dragons. They can also converse with any human or demihuman.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Any creature appearing in a sea dragon’s territory without permission is considered to be an enemy. The sea dragon attacks with its breath weapon and front flippers, closing to finish off a wounded opponent with its powerful jaws.</div><div class='indent'>A sea dragon attempts to capsize unauthorized vessels entering its territory. To determine the sea dragon’s chance of capsizing a vessel, divide the dragon’s size by the ship’s size and multiply by 100. (For instance, if a 50-foot sea dragon attempts to capsize an 200-foot ship, it has a 25% chance of success.) This chance never exceeds 95% -a sea dragon always has a 95% chance of capsizing a ship the same size as itself or smaller.</div><div class='indent'>Knowledgeable sailors crossing a sea dragon’s territory often dump barrels of treasure overboard in hopes of placating it. Usually, anything less than the ship’s entire cargo is considered an insult. Once the ship is capsized, the sea dragon tries to kill all of the ship’s passengers.</div><div class='indent'>Breath Weapon and Special Abilities: A sea dragon’s breath weapon is a cone of steam 50 feet long that is five feet wide at the dragon’s mouth and 30 feet wide at the base. Damage caused by the breath weapon varies with the dragon’s age (see table above). A victim of the blast can roll a saving throw vs. breath weapon; success means only half damage was suffered. The breath weapon is as effective underwater as it is in the open air and can be used once every three combat rounds.</div><div class='indent'>From birth, a sea dragon can breathe both water and air. It possesses a type of sonar that enables it to detect creatures and ob-ects of man-size or larger up to 360 feet away in the water.</div><div class='indent'>Once per day, a sea dragon has the <i>scaly command</i> power over a variable number of scaly creatures with animal intelligence or less (primarily reptiles and fishes) living in the water within a half-mile radius. The number of creatures under <i>scaly command</i> is 4d10 times the age category of the dragon. This control lasts for 2d6 turns and cannot be dispelled. No saving throws are allowed. Creatures under the <i>scaly command</i> of one sea dragon cannot fall under the control of another. Additionally, scaly creatures will never voluntarily attack a sea dragon.</div><div class='indent'>As they age, sea dragons gain the following additional abilities, all useable three times per day:</div><br/><div><table><tr><td>Adult:</td><td><i>light</i></td></tr><tr><td>Old:</td><td><i>entangle</i></td></tr><tr><td>Wyrm:</td><td><i>suggestion</i></td></tr></table></div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> A sea dragon’s territory is an area of several hundred square miles of ocean. Unless pursuing an enemy or laying eggs, a sea dragon rarely leaves its territory. Its lair is usually an immense stone castle on the ocean floor. Two sea dragons never share the same territory or lair, except during the annual mating season, a period of approximately three weeks.</div><div class='indent'>A female sea dragon lays as many as 300 eggs in a deep nest on a sandy beach. After laying the eggs, she buries them, then returns to the ocean. The warm sun hatches the eggs, a process taking about eight weeks. However, it is rare that more than a few of the hatchlings survive.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Essentially herbivorous, sea dragons mainly eat algae and seaweed, but also enjoy the occasional fish, mineral chunk, or swimming sailor. Their eggs are considered delicacies by many races, particularly the minotaurs of Mithas.</div>",

    "Description": "<div>Dreamshadows are illusionary creations that take the appearance of any real person or creature known to the dreamer or to anyone experiencing the dream. They are quite believable and in all ways appear to be the actual person or creature. They are normally encountered as a result of a <i><i>mindspin</i></i> spell (see the “Dreamwraith” entry for details).</div><div class='indent'>A dreamshadow can be of any alignment and can either be helpful or harmful to those experiencing it. It can appear as a monster (such as a whisper spider or an undead beast), a member of an intelligent race (such as an elf or a draconian), or even as the dreamer himself. Not only does a dreamshadow have the shape of the creature or person it mimics, it also has the same alignment and personality. An ogre dreamshadow, for instance, will probably be stupid and hostile, while a Solamnic Knight dreamshadow will probably be stern and honorable. A character encountering a dreamshadow of himself will discover that the dreamshadow shares the identical equipment, clothing, and physical features, but not necessarily the same knowledge and information.</div><div class='indent'>It is extremely difficult to distinguish dreamshadows from their non-illusionary counterparts, but since dreamshadows always retam the intelligence of the dreamer some dreamshadows can exhibit peculiar aberrations. For instance, a chicken that scratches a message in the dirt or an ogre who speaks with eloquence and precision might alert the observer that he is dealing with a dreamshadow instead of the actual creature.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> A dreamshadow attacks with the same weapons, abilities, strategies, and ferocity as its non-illusionary counterpart. However, a dreamshadow causes partially illusionary damage. This damage is equal to 1 hit point of real damage per 4 points of illusionary damage (for instance, if a character takes 12 points of illusionary damage, he experiences it as 3 hit points of real damage). Note that while a character is in the dream he believes illusionary damage to be genuine and therefore drops to the ground as though lifeless after taking what he believes to be the appropriate damage. When a character believes he has suffered a fatal amount of damage, he “dies.” The illusionary nature of the damage is apparent only after his companions successfully end the dream or the dream is otherwise dispelled.</div><div class='indent'>Spells cast by magic-using dreamshadows have effects on characters equivalent to actual spells. A <i>fireball</i> cast by a dreamshadow dragon does a comparable amount of illusionary damage. A dreamshadow gorgon turns a character to stone until the dream is ended.</div><div class='indent'>Dreamshadows cannot be disbelieved into non-existence. However, if a dreamshadow is disbelieved before it conducts its first attack against a character, the character suffers no illusionary damage. A character cannot disbelieve a dreamshadow once he has suffered illusionary damage from it (see the “Dreamwraith” entry for information about disbelieving illusions).</div><div class='indent'>Characters can use their weapons and spells against a dreamshadow just as they would against its non-illusionary counterpart. the dreamshadow suffers normal damage, not illusionary damage. When a dreamshadow is reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.</div><div class='indent'>Dreamshadows have no magic resistance in the first level of a <i>mindspin</i> dream, 10% magic resistance in the second level, and 20% in the third level (see the “Dreamwraith” entry for information about the <i>mindspin</i> levels).</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> A dreamshadow has no meaningful existence beyond that as experienced by the dreamer. Hence, even if a dreamshadow survives an encounter with a character or adventuring party, for all practical purposes it ceases to exist when the dream is ended. Dreamshadows collect illusionary treasure; their treasure items have no value for non-illusionary characters and cannot be taken from the dream.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Dreamshadows interact with one another as they would in the non-illusionary world, for instance, a dreamshadow farmer might be tending a flock of dreamshadow sheep, while a band of dreamshadow hunters might be stalking a dreamshadow ice bear. But dreamshadows only appear to eat, drink, and sleep, since their physiological functions are all illusionary</div>",

If he fails the saving throw, the character is overwhelmed with despair. He joins the dreamwraith, repeating the litany of hopelessness. Only a <i>dispel magic</i> spell or a convincing speech about hope and courage can negate the <i>despair</i>.

They are somewhat stockier than other dwarves, averaging 150-180 pounds. Typical attire includes fuss, beathes boots, and dull gray chain mail.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Daergar are hot-tempered and brutal fighters. They are utterly without honor on the battlefield. Seldom encountered alone, Daergar usually fight in squads of 1d6 +6, often accompanied by wild dogs, hell hounds, or similarly vicious creatures. Daergar carry shields, hammers, clubs, and battle axes.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> Daergar have established impressive strongholds in the caverns beneath the Kharolis Mountains. Outposts are also rumored to exist elsewhere on the continent. Daergar cities are dark and gloomy. A typical Daergar city is dominated by windowless prison modules and a huge arena where prisoners engage in bloody combat for the amusement of the citizens.</div><div class='indent'>About 40-50% of a group of Daergar are females and young. About 80% of adult males are 1st-level fighters, 10% are 2nd- or 3rd-level fighters, 5% are 4th-level or higher fighters, and 5% are priests and thieves of various levels. The Daergar leader is generally the most powerful warrior of the kingdom; rule passes to the leader’s eldest son when the leader dies. The leader represents the Daergar in the Council of Thanes (see the Mountain Dwarf entry for more about the council).</div><div class='indent'>Among the most revered members of the Daergar society are the bonemasters.

    "Description": "<div>Gully dwarves, also known as Aghar, are stupid, filthy, and obnoxious.</div><div class='indent'>Gully dwarves are short and squat, averaging four feet in height and weighing about 100 pounds.Their skin tones range from olive brown to a light parchment color Males wear long, scruffy beards; females have cheek hair but no beards.Hair color ranges from dirty blond to duil black.Eyes can be watery blue, dull green, or hazel. Gully dwarves have narrower fingers and limbs than other dwarves, and their skin is often covered with scars, boils, sores, and filth. Pot bellies are common among both sexes.</div><div class='indent'>The stupidity of gully dwarves is legendary.To a gully dwarf, any number greater than one is two, which simply means more than one.In spite of their dull minds, gully dwarves take themselves quite seriously.They tend to have inflated ideas of their own importance, and puncturing their egos is almost impossible.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Since they regard cowardice as a virtue, gully dwarves have raised groveling to an art form.If confronted by a dangerous opponent but not immediately attacked, gully dwarves either faint, cry, beg for mercy, divulge rivers of information, run away, or stand and hake.If attacked, gully dwarves defend themselves, but they something fight with their eyes closed.Gully dwarves are not above stealing, lying, or bullying, and dirty tricks are among their favorite tactics Master scavengers, gully dwarves use any armor and weapons they happen to recover from garbage dumps or scrap heaps.Padded and studded leather are commonly worn.Gully dwarves rarely use weapons other than clubs, daggers, knifes, and hand axes. A few have learned to use slings.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> Gully dwarf communities are quite small, seldom exceeding more than 2d10 members. A typical clan of 11 members includes a chieftain(a fighter of level 2-6), about four 1 st-level fighters(one of whom serves as the clans shaman, although he has no magical abilities), one fighter of level 2 - 4(or a thief of the same level range);the rest are females and children Most clans live in abandoned villages or in the wilderness in old mines and caves.Others live in slums, refuse dumps, or the sewer systems of large cities.When several clans live together, the strongest and cleverest chieftain becomes the local king, whose title is produced by adding the prefix High to his clan name Each successive king often calls himself the First, owing to the gully dwarf’s inability to count Gully dwarves believe magical items are useless because their magic was put into them by other races.To gully dwarves, the most powerful items are those that seem to do nothing at all.Objects such as old bones, rotten fruit, fur balls, and bent sticks are treasured and venerated.The clan’ s shaman keeps these holy relics and administers their use.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Other races avoid gully dwarves, but they are occasionally hired to perform menial tasks. Gnomes occasionally hire them as assassins and spies, even though gully dwarves aren’t particular adept at these jobs.Gully dwarves eat anything. Many gully dwarves keep a pot of stew boiling constantly, throwing anything dead or nearly dead into the pot.</div><br/></div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Gully Dwarf Class Limits</b><table><thead><tr><th>Class</th><th>Max.

However, they share the Silvanesti’s prejudice toward other races and are intolerant of interracial marriages.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Qualinesti are more aggressive than Silvanesti but not as tactically sophisticated. Still, opponents who underestimate them soon learn that Qualinesti are courageous, and confident combatants. Long swords, bows, and spears are among their preferred weapons. They usually wear chain mail or scale mail and often carry shields.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> Qualinesti originally occupied the western regions of the Silvanesti kingdom. They left to form their own communities following a disagreement with their cousins’ policy of strict caste systems. Though the Qualinesti hoped their new settlements would grow in trade and culture, their hopes were dashed by the Cataclysm, which introduced a period of terrorism and barbarism. The elves were seen as easy prey and the endless raids devastated their communities.</div><div class='indent'>Many communities still exist in the forests west of the Kharolis Mountains, but these are small, isolated farming villages.</div><div class='indent'>Today, there is only a single major Qualinesti city–Qualinost. Four immense spires rise from each corner of the city, all connected by arched bridges. A hilltop in the center of the city contains a dense grove of trees. Next to this grove is the Hall of the Sky, a huge open square rising above the trees containing an inlaid map of the adjacent lands. Though most of the private homes are modest, many are quite ornate.</div><div class='indent'>An average group of Qualinesti includes a variety of all applicable classes and levels, as many as 20% have magical abilities, and at least 10% are 4th-level or higher fighters.</div><div class='indent'>Qualinesti society is far less structured than that of their Silvanesti cousins. The Qualinesti are ruled by a Speaker of Suns who must be a blood relative of Kith-Kanan, the elven leader who originally established the Qualinesti. The Thalas-Enthia is a senate appointed to represent the various guilds and communities. In all matters of policy, the Thalas-Enthia brings its recommendations to the Speaker of Suns.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> The Qualinesti trade agricultural and mineral products with dwarves and humans.

Their hair ranges from light-brown to blonde-white, and their eyes are hazel. They prefer loose garments, flowing robes, and billowing capes. Their clothes are various shades of green and brown. They speak in melodic tones and move with a natural grace.</div><div class='indent'>Silvanesti are a proud, arrogant, and stoic people who have little use for other races, including other elves. They believe in strict racial purity.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Silvanesti are brave and able fighters, making optimum use of terrain for concealment and protection. They relish the opportunity to engage skilled opponents in combat. Typical weapons include long swords, two-handed swords, and spears. They also use bows of all types and sometimes tip their arrows with a special venom. Victims struck by these arrows must roll successful saving throws vs. paralyzation or be paralyzed for 1d10 rounds. Most wear chain mail, although some carry shields to improve their AC to 4.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> The Silvanesti race has endured for over 3,000 years. They have become set in their ways. During the War of the Lance, the Silvanesti fled west and settled on the western shores of Harkun Bay. This is where most Silvanesti remain today.</div><div class='indent'>Silvanesti abhor contact with humans or other races; marriages between humans and Silvanesti have occurred, albeit infrequently. Their relationship with the Qualinesti is strained.</div><div class='indent'>Long years within a safe, settled empire have stratified the various crafts and tasks into a rigid system of castes, or Houses. At the top of the system is House Royal, the descendants of Silvanos, the first leader of the early elven clans and from whom the Silvanesti took their name.</div><div class='indent'>Beneath this house are those of the craftsmen and guilds, such as House Mystic, House Gardener, House Mason, and House Woodshaper. The House Protector, also known as Wildrunners, serve as the army of the Silvanesti. No one marries outside his or her guild without permission, and permission is rarely granted.</div><div class='indent'>A typical Silvanesti settlement includes a variety of all applicable classes and levels; at least 10% have magical abilities, and at least 10% are 4th-level or higher fighters. Silvanesti make their homes in glades surrounded by dense forests. Their buildings are tall, ornate structures of wood and stone. The most striking features of a Silvanesti settlement are the low stone pyramids used as tombs for the Silvanesti dead, and the large masses of briars and brambles created by House Woodshaper and House Gardener to serve as borders.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Although their diet is supplemented by small portions of rabbit, squirrel, and venison, Silvanesti have more of an appetite for fruits, grains, and vegetables than they do for meat.

Their skin is dark brown, and they draw designs on their faces and exposed skin with clay and paints. Their hair is dark, ranging from black to light brown, and occasionally silvery white. Their eyes are hazel. They wear fringed leather clothes decorated with feathers; they proudly display beautiful necklaces and bracelets made of silver and turquoise.</div><div class='indent'>Kagonesti believe that harmony with nature is the key to a full and happy life.

Their villages are temporary structures of animal hide and light wood, using the boughs of living trees to aid in construction and camouflage. Each village is home to a tribe of several interrelated families. About 70% of the tribe are fighters of various levels, the remainder are 0-level workers and children. The tribe centers around the chief – the oldest and wisest member – and his family. The chief makes all decisions for the tribe.</div><div class='indent'>Kagonesti have a more animistic view of the cosmos than most other races.

They are slightly taller and somewhat stockier than most elves.</div><div class='indent'>Since most are raised in an atmosphere of shame, half-elves are insecure and unsure of themselves. In extreme instances, this insecurity manifests itself in rebellious or anti-social behavior. Others are trusting of strangers, yet lack the openness necessary to establish true and lasting friendship. Many are natural leaders, but few feel worthy of a leader’s responsibility Regardless of their disposition, all half-elves are loners – brooding, quiet, and struggling with self-doubt.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Half.elves are excellent fighters with no obvious tears. If there is a flaw in their fighting style, it iS their tendency to perform life-threatening acts of bravado. A half-elf often challenges the most formidable opponent in a group of attackers or volunteers for the most dangerous missions.</div><div class='indent'>Half-elves particularly excel at melee attacks; magic-using half-elves usually reserve their spells for emergencies or to assist their companions. Long swords are their favorite weapons, but they also frequently use daggers and long bows. They wear a variety of armor, preferring chain mail when it is avariable. Unlike other elven races, half-elves can be skilled horsemen.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> Because elves and humans are often attracted to each other, intermarriage is all but inevitable. No elven race, however, sanctions such marriages, forcing elven and human lovers into discreet relationships.</div><div class='indent'>Reaction to half-elves from other races varies. The race-conscious Silvanesti, for instance, are particularly revolted by interracial marriages. Qualinesti are more compassionate toward half-elves, treating them coldly but allowing them a place in their societies. However, half-elves seldom rise to positions of trust or responsibility in a Qualinesti community. Kagonesti respect half-elves as they would any creature of nature, but they are never accepted as full members of a tribe.</div><div class='indent'>Humans have a mixed reaction to half-elves. Years ago, half-elves in human society were considered a great blessing and brought honor to a human household, but this attitude has diminished considerably with the passage of time.

They can breathe both air and water.</div><div class='indent'>Suspicious and wary of strangers, Dimernesti ally themselves with outsiders only in the most extreme circumstances. They are intolerant of other races and cultures.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Dimernesti are aggressive and agile. Though they lack the Dargonesti’s spellcasting abilities, they share their shape-changing ability. Dimernesti can shapechange to an otter three times per day, the transformation taking one round. A shape-changed Dimernesti retains his hit points, but gains the movement rate and all special abilities of an otter (AC 5; MV 12, SW 18; #AT 1; Dmg 1d3). Dimernesti take advantage of the otter’s quickness to pursue down enemies.</div><div class='indent'>Dimernesti attack their opponents in teams; as many as 20 Dimernesti may compose a single team. The team attacks or immobilizes the most formidable opponents first. Dimernesti employ spears, tridents, and short swords. Dimernesti wear a special lightweight chain mail that does not impede their movement in water. They often ride hippocampi into battle.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> The Dimernesti were originally elven mariners who split from the elven land races and became dwellers of the sea. Prior to the split, the Dimernesti enjoyed a partnership with the Silvanesti. The Dimernesti adopted a simpler version of the Silvanesti guild system for their new society.</div><div class='indent'>The Dimernesti leader, called the Speaker of the Sea, is always a clan elder who is a blood relative of the previous Speaker. While there are many guilds, there is no caste system and the boundaries between guilds are not as rigid.</div><div class='indent'>Most Dimernesti live in schools that are clan-oriented groups. There are no families, since all adults in the group care for the young of the school. At least 5% of a typical group are 4th-level or higher fighters, and at least 10% are 2nd- to 3rd-level fighters.</div><div class='indent'>Dimernesti are nomadic. They make their lairs in shallow waters among kelp beds, reefs, and shipwrecks.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> The Dimernesti have no formal relationships with other races. They sometimes trade with surface dwellers. Dimernesti occasionally sneak ashore at night to raid nearby settlements for tools and other necessities.

    "Description": "<div>Eyewings are loathsome inhabitants of the Abyss. They are obedient, loyal, and dumb – perfect servitors for the dark gods and their more powerful minions.</div><div class='indent'>An eyewing’s body is a fat, egg-shaped ball covered with matted black fur. The 5-foot-wide body is supported by a pair of five-foot-long leathery bat wings. Each wing is tipped with a set of three razor-sharp talons. An 8-foot-long rat’s tail dangles from the back of the body. The tail ends in a small, sharp spur. It has no feet and has never been known to land.</div><div class='indent'>The body is dominated by the single, bulging, 4-foot-wide eyeball. The eyeball is black with a blood-red pupil. A vile blue fluid continuously leaks from the eye, soiling its fur. Great leathery eyelids squeeze this fluid out and away from the creature. The stench is unbelievable. It gives off an acidic smell that scorches the sensitive tissues in other creatures’ noses and mouths.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> An eyewing has two main forms of attack. The most common form is to use its claws and tail to strike its opponents. It can either swoop down on them, or hover and slash. Its second form of attack is to bomb its enemies with a large eyewing tear that is squeezed out of the large eyeball by the leathery eyelid. It has amazing control over the release of the tear -- it has the same chance to hit with a tear as with its melee attacks. It releases a tear when it is within 100 feet of its target. It can deliver this attack while hovering or diving.</div><div class='indent'>An eyewing tear is a one-foot-diameter ball of poisonous blue fluid. The attack roll determines if the target dodged the tear. If the tear hits, the victim must roll a successful saving throw vs. poison or suffer 2d6 points of damage (success means only 1d6 points of damage). The tears may also splash onto anyone within ten feet of the target. The attack roll for the splash attack is made with a -2 penalty. If someone is splashed, a saving throw vs. poison must be rolled; those who fail suffer 2d4 points of damage, while those who succeed suffer 1d4 points of damage.</div><div class='indent'>A tear hardens into a rubbery lump within 2d6 hours after being shed. The exact time depends upon the humidity, temperature, etc. Anybody handling a hardened tear must roll a successful saving throw vs. poison or suffer 1 point of damage.</div><div class='indent'>Eyewings have extremely acute vision that enables them to see with perfect accuracy for up to 25 miles. They also have infravision out to 120 feet. They are immune to all cold-based attack forms, as are their tears.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> Eyewings are supernatural creatures that exist only to serve their dark masters. When left without orders they become sluggish and listless. This should not be taken to mean that they are any less dangerous. This listlessness is their expression of boredom, but nothing relieves eyewing boredom quite like tearing apart innocent creatures.</div><div class='indent'>Eyewings have no society as such. They do not have a culture. Their simple language consists of shrill squeaks. They understand other spoken languages, but cannot speak them. When in the Abyss they are found only on layers that allow for flying. Their immunity to cold makes them at home on any of the icy layers as well.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Eyewings are sexless creatures that are not a part of nature. They kill even when they’re not ordered to, just for the pleasure of it. Eyewings have been encountered on the moon, where there is no air to breathe and no water to drink. It is assumed that they do not need air or water. They have never been seen to eat; it is assumed by most who have studied them that they are sustained by magic. The more powerful creatures of the Abyss have no qualms about an eyewing snack should one be nearby, but they are not the natural prey of any creature.</div>",

    "Description": "<div>Fetch are harbingers of death. Existing on the fringes of the Abyss, these creatures can only reach into the Prime Material plane through reflective surfaces, such as mirrors or pools of water.</div><div class='indent'>A fetch appears to be a haggard and deathly pale imitation of the person or creature gazing into the reflective surface. If more than one person or creature gazes into the reflective surface at the same time, the fetch assumes the image of the person or creature closest to the reflective surface; if all are equally distant, it chooses randomly. The fetch never assumes the image of a person or creature taller than seven feet or shorter than four feet.</div><div class='indent'>The fetch’s eyes are dull and lifeless. It reflexively breaks into an evil grin when its eyes meet those of its intended victim for the first time. Its flesh iS ice cold to the touch. Fetch neither breathe nor speak, although they do engage in limited telepathic communication with evil clerics of 10th level or higher.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Though fetch can gaze into the Prime Material plane through reflective surfaces, they cannot emerge into this plane until they meet the eyes of their victims. Fetch can appear in any type of reflective surface, including a mirror, the surface of a pond, or even a shiny silver tray. However, the surface must be large enough for the fetch’s body to fit through. (For instance, assume that a fetch is gazing through a one-foot-diameter mirror hanging on the wall of a room at an inn. An overweight warrior enters the room. The fetch assumes the warrior’s image, but the fetch is now too plump to squeeze through the mirror, and the intended victim is sate.)</div><div class='indent'>A fetch is invisible to all but the intended victim, even when attacking. <i>True seeing</i> (but not <i>detect invisibility</i>) spells reveal the creature. The intended victim can always see the fetch in the reflective surface. The victim suffers penalties of -2 to his attack roll and +2 to his AC. The victim’s companions suffer a -4 penalty to their attack rolls and a +2 penalty to their ACs, when attacking the fetch.</div><div class='indent'>A fetch attacks with an exact replica of the weapon of its intended victim; if the victim has more than one weapon, the fetch chooses one of them randomly. If the victim has no weapon, the fetch attacks with its hands. The fetch makes two attacks per round. Each successful attack causes the victim to lose two levels of experience – roll the Hit Dice appropriate to the victim’s class two times and subtract that number of hit points from the character’s total, also subtracting the victims Constitution bonus for those levels. If a lost level is one in which the character received a fixed number of hit points instead of a die roll, subtract the appropriate number of hit points. These hit points are permanently lost; the adjusted hit point total is now the victim’s maximum. All powers, spells, and abilities associated with the lost levels are also lost.</div><div class='indent'>If a victim is reduced to level 0, the fetch pulls him through the reflective surface and into the Abyss. Once into the Abyss, the victim turns into a fetch. If the victim is reduced to level 0, but the fetch is killed or is otherwise prevented from taking victim into the Abyss, the victim, assuming he is still alive, becomes an ordinary person–his adventuring days are over. He can continue his career if a <i>wish</i> or <i>restoration</i> spell is cast on his behalf. If a level 0 character suffers another successful hit from the fetch, he is slain instantly, regardless of whether he has any hit points remaining. Unlike victims of other energy-draining creatures, a level 0 character slam by a fetch does not return as an undead.</div><div class='indent'>A fetch can pull victims into the Abyss only through the reflective surface from which it originally appeared. If that reflective surface is destroyed, such as by shattering the mirror or draining the pond, the fetch must locate another reflective surface to return itself to the Abyss. If it does not locate a new reflective surface within 24 hours, it begins to lose hit points at the rate of 3d6 per day. If it is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, it is destroyed.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> Motivated by an obsessive hatred of all intelligent races of good or neutral alignment, fetch spend most of their time in the Abyss searching for portals leading to reflective surfaces in the Prime Material plane. Less than 1% of the discovered portals lead to an accessible reflective surface. New fetch are created only from victims pulled into the Abyss.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Fetch neither eat nor drink. They occasionally engage in recreational killings of weaker creatures encountered in the Abyss. Fetch are sometimes used as assassins and aides by the gods of evil and by evil wizards.</div>",

    "Description": "<div>Fire minions are fearsome creatures, apparently from the elemental plane of Fire. Their bodies are composed of living flame, and although they can assume any form they wish, the most common is that of a large humanoid, complete with fangs and homs. Their bodies are the colors of flame and constantly swirl and flicker with the living light.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Fire minions are powerful warriors, fortunately (for their enemies) limited by their environment from spreading and conquering. They attack by rising up out of fire, assuming their form in the process. Since this takes one round, it normally provides sufficient warning to the victim and only allows the normal chance of surprise. However, a fire minion can also return back into the flame (in one round), move to another location and reappear during the next round. While this does not provide any specific combat bonus, it can be unnerving to inexperienced opponents.</div><div class='indent'>Fire minions normally wield large swords. Whatever the weapon used, the creature causes 2d6 points of damage. In addition, the creature has a constant flame aura that causes 1d6 points of damage to all within five feet unless protected from fire in some way. No attack roll is needed to hit and no saving throw is allowed to avoid this aura damage.</div><div class='indent'>Because they are made from living flame, fire minions are completely immune to fire-based attacks. Indeed, magical flames (fireballs and dragon fire) restore hit points equal to the damage the attack would normally cause. Although they would seem to be highly vulnerable to water-based attacks, their intense heat protects them somewhat. They suffer 1 extra point of damage per die from water-based attacks. They are extremely vulnerable to cold-based attacks and suffer double the normal damage from these (although saving throws still apply). In addition, any water. or cold-based attack halves the length the time the fire minion can stay out of its fiery home.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> Little is known of the fire minions. lives, simply because their natural environment precludes most observation by outsiders. It is certain they come from the elemental plane of Fire, and are considered free-willed fire elementals. Their life habits there are unknown.</div><div class='indent'>Fire minions have a limited ability to gate themselves to the Prime Material plane. Such gating can be accomplished only in areas of intense flame-most commonly the cauldrons of volcanoes. Normal fires are not sufficient to allow gating and so fire minions tend to appear only in exotic locales.</div><div class='indent'>Fire, flame, and lava are the natural homes of fire minions, and they dwell within them with no ill effects. They can travel through these materials as easily as walking. However, they have only a limited ability to leave the flames and risk injury or death when they do so. A fire minion will not feel the effects for 1d6 hours. After this time they lose their flame aura ability. In another 1d6 hours, the minion begins to take damage at the rate of 1-2 points per turn. This continues until either the minion returns to the flame (to rest and heal) or dies. Note that magical fires can heal the damage but cannot prolong the ability to move about on land.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> It is hard to know just where the fire minions fit into things, since so little is known of their lives in the plane of Fire. It is believed they eat lava or fire, although this iS not confirmed. When slain, their bodies evaporate in a burst of ash, leaving very little to examine or study.</div>",

Females are as large as males. Though short and stocky, tinker gnomes move gracefully, and their hands are deft and sure. They have rich brown skin, curly or straight white hair, china-blue or violet eyes, and straight, cavity-free teeth. Males have soft, curly white beards and moustaches. Both sexes have rounded ears and large noses; they develop facial wrinkles after age 50.</div><div class='indent'>The voice of a tinker gnome resembles that of a human, except the timbre is more nasal. Tinker gnomes speak intensely and rapidly, running their words together in unending sentences. They are capable of listening carefully and speaking at the same time. When two gnomes meet, they babble away, answering questions asked by the other as part of the same continuous sentence. Gnomes have learned to speak slowly and distinctly to other races. If frightened or depressed, a gnome may speak in much shorter sentences than usual.</div><div class='indent'>Tinker gnomes are second only to gully dwarves and goblins as the worst dressers on Ansalon. They wear almost anything that is relatively clean. They especially enjoy scarves, shawls, and hard leather footwear. In their research areas, they wear easily cleaned smocks and coats.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Unless they are adventurers, gnomes rarely carry weapons, although some of their tools can be used as weapons. Strange weapons of dubious utility are always being invented. Some, like the three-barrel water blaster, are all but useless, while others, like the multiple spear flinger, show promise.</div><div class='indent'>Hand-held and light crossbows, slings, short bows, darts, and melee weapons that can be hurled, such as hammers and hand axes, are the gnomes’ preferred weapons.

Catapults called gnomeflingers serve as rapid transport, as do steam-powered cars mounted on rails. Beneath the city is a complex network of tunnels and mines that spreads in all directions. This ancient tunnel system, also known as the Undercity, contams the lairs of dangerous monsters and pockets of hostile subterranean races. The gnomes use some of the tunnels as dump sites for hazardous wastes.</div><div class='indent'>All tinker gnomes belong to a guild. There are perhaps 50 major guilds and a host of minor ones. Hydraulics, Chemistry, Architecture, Hydrodynamics, Kinetics, Mathematics, Weapons, Mechanical Engineering, and Education are among the more popular guilds. Only the Agricultural and Medical Guilds are concerned with life sciences. Scientific guilds without immediate application, such as Astronomy, are usually small and have little influence. Clerical gnomes originally belonged to the Priests Guild, which was the first and only guild to become extinct. Their functions were eventually absorbed by the Medical and Philosophers Guilds.</div><div class='indent'>All gnomes have a Lifequest: to attain perfect understanding of a single device. Since few have attained this goal, the tinker gnomes are perpetually unfulfilled.</div><div class='indent'>The gnomes are governed by an elected Grand Council of clan leaders and guild masters The council members serve for life. Methods of election vary from guild to guild and from clan to clan. The government is so heavily laden with bureaucracy that few major decisions are actually rendered by the Grand Council. Most decisions are made by guilds and clans who have their own agendas, regardless of the wishes of the rest of the community. Everyone insists on strict adherence to regulations, but this process is so time-consuming that even gnomes lack the necessary patience.</div><div class='indent'>A gnome has three different names. One is the gnome’s true name, which is actually an extensive history of the gnome’s entire family tree. Though gnomes can easily remember at least the firstGnome, Tinker (Minoi) few thousand letters of their true names, they use a shorter name for routine communication. This name is a simple listing of the highlights of the gnome’s ancestry, requiring only half a minute or so to recite. Humans and other races who deal with gnomes have developed even shorter names for them, consisting of the first one or two syllables of their true names. Gnomes consider these abbreviated names undignified, but have learned to live with them. Common to any gnomish colony are the sages who record endless volumes of information, guesses, facts, figures, speculations and philosophical doodles detailing their guild committees’ various concerns. These records are seldom meaningful to anyone except the authors.</div><div class='indent'>Reorx is the only deity recognized by the tinker gnomes. Though they have no formal religious services, the gnomes have a healthy respect for their god. Reorx is thought of as an unusually large gnome who epitomizes the gnomish love of creating and tinkering, as evidenced by such inventions as the sun and the moons.</div><div class='indent'>Though most gnomes are content to stay home and tinker with their projects, there are some who can be as adventurous as members of any other race. Adventuring gnomes are generally unable to learn from previous experience and repeat the same mistakes, yet they are often successful in developing quirky solutions to save the day for their companions. Adventurer gnomes are general handymen and jacks-of-all-trades; anything and everything draws their attention, causing them to reach for their notebooks or tool belts.</div><div class='indent'>But the vast majority of gnomes are devoted to creating new devices. Gnomish inventions are almost exclusively driven by basic mechanical devices, such as gears, windmills, waterwheels, pulleys, and screws, in unnecessarily complicated arrangements. Their sheer love of technology is their downfall, for they improve their inventions to death. Simple solutions are rejected in favor of redundant and ultimately unworkable complications. Needless to say, gnomish technology has had little impact on the cultures of Ansalon.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> In general, tinker gnomes are not well-liked by other races. Their technological bent makes them quite alien to those accustomed to magic, and their poor understanding of social relations puts off most potential friends. The Agricultural Guild looks after the gnomes’ nutritional needs, maintaining fungigrowth farms and herds of cave-dwelling sheep. Research into the creation of artificial foods continues, but so far has produced nothing edible.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Mad Gnomes</b></div><br><div>Mad gnomes look like normal tinker gnomes and have similar abilities, but they have no talent for technology. They are almost always from lands far away from Ansalon. The few mad gnomes who have learned technological skills never do their work properly as far as normal gnomes are concerned–their devices work too well.</div><div class='indent'>All off-world gnomes are considered to be mad gnomes. Krynn gnomes get a yearly dice roll to see if they become mad gnomes. If a 100 is rolled on 1d100, 1d100 is rolled again. If a 100 result occurs again, the gnome becomes a mad gnome. Mad gnomes from Krynn start out with the gnomish technological skills. Off-world mad gnomes have a 1% chance of learning gnomish technological skills during any six-month period spent with normal gnomes; the roll is not cumulative and can be checked only once every six months. Unlike normal tinker gnomes, mad gnomes with technological skills create devices that are elegant and efficient.</div><div class='indent'>Mad gnomes who can use technology get a +3 bonus to any success roll involved in creating a device. Also, the device is automatically 1d6 sizes smaller than a regular gnomish device of this type.</div><br><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Tinker Gnome Abilities</b></div><br><div>Tinker gnomes have all of the special abilities of gnomes listed in the 2nd Edition Players Handbook.</div><div class='indent'>Their initial ability rolls are modified by a -1 penalty to Strength and a +2 bonus to Dexterity.

    "Description": "<div>The gurik cha’ahl (“ghost people”) are the dangerous and unpleasant offspring of the Ilquar goblins of Taladas. They are the ill-favored who, driven out of the villages, have managed to survive in the forests against the odds. They look much like normal goblins, except for some abnormality that marks them.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> The ghost people are not brave warriors and are never likely to be. Their survival has been due to their stealth, cunning, and deceitfulness, not their fierce combat prowess.</div><div class='indent'>Gurik cha’ahl are quite stealthy. They move silently 70% of the time and have a natural ability to use camouflage and natural terrain. There is only a 25% chance they are spotted by casual observation. This chance improves by 30% for close scrutiny and an additional 30% if the gurik cha’ahl is moving. (Thus there is a 85% chance of spotting a moving gurik cha’ahl if the character watches carefully.) While the ability to move silently applies to any type of terrain, the camouflage ability requires the presence of some concealing terrain, although it can be quite slight.</div><div class='indent'>A gurik cha’ahl that moves silently imposes a -4 penalty to the party’s surprise rolls. One that fails to move silently but iS still unspotted causes a -2 penalty to character surprise rolls.</div><div class='indent'>Once in combat, a gurik cha’ ah1 will try to cause as much harm as possible, or steal something useful and escape as quickly as it can. The creatures have no desire to fight it out or battle superior odds. Thus most attacks by the gurik are against lone stragglers or solitary hunters. On rare occasions several gurik will operate together as a group.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> The gurik cha’ahl are solitary dwellers. Rejects of the goblin tribes who live in the Ilquar Mountains, the gurik cha’ahl have managed to survive alone in the wilderness against the odds. Some have dim memories of their childhood, but most were abandoned at too young an age to remember. Nonetheless, the similarity in appearance between themselves and the goblins has not escaped their notice. They have developed an intense hatred of the goblins and delight in causing them harm.</div><div class='indent'>The gurik cha.ahl are loners, without friends or communities. Because of their natures, they do not even trust each other, and classify other gurik with the goblins in general. The few times they do cooperate are when they are faced with a large incursion of goblins. Although they are spiteful and violent, their rage is directed mostly at the goblins. They attack other creatures for food and little else.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> The gurik cha’ahl act as predators and scavengers in their territory. Beyond this, their role in the local culture is strictly as a tool for mothers to scare children, a bogeyman to frighten them into being good or going to sleep.</div>",

    "Description": "<div>Hatori, sometimes called the crocodiles of the sands are giant reptiles dwelling within sandy desert wastes. The hatori’s hard, knobby hide ranges in color from gray-white to red-brown and is virtually indistinguishable from stone. Hatori use this semblance to great advantage, allowing the wind to partially bury them beneath the sands so that a casual observer may believe he is looking at rock outcroppings instead of behemoths of the sands.</div><div class='indent'>Hatori are shaped like overgrown lizards, save that their legs have evolved into flat, flipper-like appendages that they use in conjunction with their massive tails to ’swim’ through the sands with astonishing speed and mobility. When forced to travel upon something more solid, such as a rocky plain, hatori move by awkwardly flopping and dragging themselves forward. Hatori eyes are normally concealed deep within dark recesses that look like small hollows. In the case of greater hatori (6 HD and over) these recesses sometimes look like cavern entrances.</div><div class='indent'>Greater hatori are identical to lesser hatori in all respects save size and their ability to swallow larger prey whole (see below).</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> The only thing that can drive hatori into combat is hunger. Unfortunately, hatori have voracious appetites and food is rare in their home environment, so they never pass up an opportunity to make a meal out of a passing traveler-or even an entire caravan. The hatori’s favorite hunting method is to position themselves along a well-used migratory trail or caravan route. When, believing the hatori to be no more than a rocky outcropping, a prospective meal passes nearby, the hatori spring into action.</div><div class='indent'>Once the battle begins, hatori try to bite their victims with their toothy maws. Greater hatori swallow man-sized victims whole on a natural attack roll of 20. Such victims suffer 1d12 points of damage per round from the crushing and acid effects of the digestive tract. Swallowed victims cannot escape until the hatori is killed, for the muscular action of the esophagus prevents them from climbing out the throat.</div><div class='indent'>Hatori use their bony tails to lash out at anyone attacking from the rear, or to attack fleeing victims while simultaneously trying to eat someone else.</div><div class='indent'>Lesser hatori can swallow whole only opponents of kender size or less (on a natural attack roll of 20). Experience points earned for defeating a hatori depend upon its number of HD. See Tables 31 and 32 on page 47 of the 2nd Edition Dungeon Master’s Guide to compute these XP values.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> Hatori have in the sandy regions of large deserts. Because they are constantly se -ching for food, however, they tend to be found near migratory paths or along busy caravan routes. They stay in a productive area until food becomes scarce. Hatori grow very slowly, at the rate of only one foot per year, but they keep growing throughout their lives. They accumulate Hit Dice at the rate of 1 HD every ten years. Therefore, young hatori of 1 HD are usually ten feet or less in length and ten years old or younger, hatori of 2 HD are between ten and 20 feet and between ten and 20 years of age, etc.</div><div class='indent'>Females care for their hatchlings until the young reach 50 feet in length (5 HD). This iS the only time when they are commonly encountered in groups, for adult hatori are solitary creatures. Female hatori accompanied by hatchlings seldom exceed 10 HD, for they generally stop bearing young after their 100th year.</div><div class='indent'>Every ten years, male hatori and young females without any offspring migrate to the center of the desert. Here the males engage in ferocious battles to win the right to breed with the females. Although no civilized man has ever witnessed these mating rituals, certain desert tribes speak of a time of thunder when mountains die. These legends may refer to battles occurring during the hatori mating season</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Hatori eat anything, though they cannot digest gems or magical armor and weaponry. These items tend to accumulate in their stomachs over their long lifetimes. Hatori have no natural predators (save for each other at mating time), though it is rumored that certain kinds of dragons have been known to attack smaller hatori in times of hunger. Legends speak of a hidden hatori burial ground where ancient hatori go to die. If such a burial ground exists, it certainly abounds with gems and magical armor.</div>",

The character attempting must still roll for the attack. If successful, he has pried the beast’s jaws open.</div><div class='indent'>Being insectoid, horax are vulnerable to cold.

This effect lasts for 2d6 rounds.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> The horax are communal creatures, living in small colonies of 30+1d10 individuals. There is no distinction between male and female horax. Each colony is located underground in a series of chambers. There are several communal chambers connected to a central egg chamber. Normally, there are 3d6 young among the eggs (HD 1, AC 7, Dmg 1d6). Other chambers are used to store food dragged back to the lair by the horax. These are kept for later use, preserved by the dry air of the tunnels. These chambers contain whatever treasure the horax have accidentally collected.

They venture onto only the surface in the hours of dusk, after the hot desert sun has cooled, but before the chill night air makes them sluggish. Although they prefer fresh kills, they also scavenge. They do not seem to have preferences for prey, although they seldom attack other insectoid creatures.</div><div class='indent'>The back plates of the horax can be fashioned into a lightweight and durable armor (AC 4) by armorers experienced at handling the stuff.

Those staring into the water notice the waves transforming into a mass of grinning faces, clawed hands, and sharp tails, all enveloped in a growing cloud of red mist. The imps begin to push the ship, causing it to pitch and shiver. During the next hour, the imps transform into their mist forms to overwhelm the ship.</div><div class='indent'>When an imp is in its physical form, it attacks with a chilling touch that causes 1d6 points of damage (no saving throw), however, it cannot fly in this form and its AC is 4. In its mist form, it can fly, its AC is 1, and all attack rolls against it are made with a -2 penalty, however, it can take no physical actions (such as pushing a ship or throwing a sailor overboard) and opponents contacting it receive only 1 point of chilling damage. The imp much prefers its physical form when attacking, as it can cause much more mischief. Blood Sea imp attacks are always accompanied by nonstop screaming, cackling, and groaning.</div><div class='indent'>When a ship is surrounded by red mist, the vaporous imps flow through doorways and ooze into portholes, then polymorph back to their physical forms. Small misty imps emerge from the vapor, swarming up the masts, jerking the rigging, and loosening cargo ropes. The imps always first attempt to disable the ship, then murder the crew. If any crew members interfere with the rampaging imps, the imps try to throw them down the hold, lock them in a cabin, or toss them overboard. Imps have a Strength of 4, and they can only move a character if the total Strength points of the attacking imps exceeds the character’s Strength. The character is dragged one foot per round for every point that the imps’ combined Strength exceeds the character’s Strength.</div><div class='indent'>Blood sea imps can only be attacked with magical weapons, other attacks pass harmlessly through them. Blood sea imps can not be turned, and they are unaffected by <i>sleep</i>, <i>charm</i>, or cold-based spells. They are likewise unaffected by paralysis or poisons.</div><div class='indent'>If struck by a lightning bolt, either natural or magical, there is a 10% chance that the imp spontaneously generates a copy of itself; the copy appearing in its vaporous form.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> As their name implies, Blood Sea imps reside primarily in the Blood Sea, but some also exist in other tropical and subtropical oceans. Schools of 10d4 imps live together in shallow lairs on the ocean floor; these lairs are lined with rotten vegetation and other debris. The imps sleep in their lairs all day long, emerging only at night to search for ships battered by ocean storms. Treasure items are also stored in their lairs: imps aren’t interested in the value of treasure, but they keep various baubles as souvenirs from ships they have plundered.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Blood Sea imps are oblivious to other sea life, though they fight fiercely it attacked. The imps do not eat, drink, or breathe. They are invigorated by exposing themselves to the thunder and lightning generated by an ocean storm.</div>",

    "Description": " <div>As individuals, velvet ants, grasshoppers, and locusts are relatively harmless. But in swarms, these insects can cause immense damage to fields and forests, as well as threatening the lives of all creatures in their path.</div><br/><div><h2 style=’color:#4169E1’>Velvet Ants’</h2>The velvet ant resembles a plump version of the common ant, except for the soft fuzz that covers its entire body. The fuzz is usually red or black, but it can also be yellow, brown, or orange.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> A velvet ant swarm eats everything in its path, animal matter as well as vegetation. To determine the size of a swarm, roll 1d100 and multiply the result by 1,000. There are about 100 ants per square foot; therefore, a swarm of 10,000 ants forms a block about ten feet per side. If a swarm comes in contact with an obstacle, it turns 90” and continues. A victim in contact with a swarm has an 80% chance per round of being bitten and suffering 1d4 points of damage. The victim must roll a successful saving throw vs. poison or suffer intense pain for the next 2d4 turns, making all attack and damage rolls with a -2 penalty during this time.</div><div class='indent'>Each point of damage inflicted on an insect swarm kills 1d20 insects. They may be scattered with smoke or fire; immersion in water washes them off. If half of a swarm is killed, the survivors attempt to scatter and hide. If an entire swarm is killed, award 975 experience points.</div><br/><div><h2 style=’color:#4169E1’>Grasshoppers and Locusts</h2>The grasshopper is about two inches in length and is usually green or brown in color. The grasshopper can make leaps of about four feet. Locusts are a type of grasshopper, with shorter antennae. They can rub their hind legs against their wings to produce a distinctive chirp.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Grasshopper and locust swarms fly from place to place in search of lush fields on which to settle and consume. These swarms move in straight lines and are easy to avoid.</div><div class='indent'>To determine the size of a grasshopper swarm roll 1d100 and multiply the result by 10,000. Multiply this result by 2 when determining the size of a locust swarm. There are about 20 grasshoppers or locusts per square foot (for convenience, assume there are 20 insects per cubic foot when approximating the size of flying swarm).</div><div class='indent'>A victim in contact with a grasshopper or locust swarm has a 90% chance per round of being bitten and suffering 1 point of damage. Additionally, victims within a cloud of these insects have their vision reduced to 2d4 feet.</div><div class='indent'>Each point of damage inflicted on an insect swarm kills 1d20 insects. They may be scattered with smoke or fire, immersion in water washes them off If half of a swarm is killed the survivors attempt to scatter. If an entire swarm is killed, award 2,000 experience points.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> Insect swarms are migratory, sleeping at night wherever they happen to be. Females lay up to 100 eggs every year. These insects have no leaders or any specialized workers. They do not collect treasure.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Velvet ants eat seeds, grasses, and meat, especially enjoying carrion. The poison of velvet ants renders them inedible to carnivores.</div><div class='indent'>Grasshoppers and locusts prefer seeds and grains. Snakes, mice, birds, and spiders are among these insects’ numerous natural enemies. Grasshoppers and locusts can be eaten by carnivores.</div>",

    "Description": "<div>The kalothagh, also known as the prickleback, is an aquatic version of the manticore. Though sluggish and not particularly aggressive, the kalothagh is a known man-eater, which makes it a creature to be avoided.</div><div class='indent'>The kalothagh is a plump fish resembling a pin cushion. Its body is covered with four-foot.long spines. Its scales are mottled with dull splotches of green and brown. It has small black eyes that bulge from the top of its head, translucent fins, a dark, fan-like tail. and a smooth, pink belly. Its sharp teeth protrude from its mouth to form a small beak.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> The kalothagh is 80% undetectable when hiding in seaweed. If the kalothagh is ‘badly damaged’ (that is, if it loses 75% or more of its hit points), it inflates a special bladder running the length of its body, then floats belly-up to the surface. It deflates when the danger has passed.</div><div class='indent'>The kalothagh’s primary weapons are its spines. It has a total of 32 spines and can shoot up to four spines per round at targets up to 90’ away. A volley of spines is always directed to the same target, but the target can be in any position relative to the kalothagh except directly under it; thanks to the location of its eyes, the kalothagh can see in all directions. Once a spine has been fired, a new one grows in its place in 1d6 weeks.</div><div class='indent'>When a victim is struck by a spine, there is a 20% chance that the spine becomes lodged in his flesh. The spines are covered with small curved barbs resembling fishhooks, making it difficult to pull the spines free. When a spine is pulled from the victim’s flesh, the victim suffers an additional 1d4 points of tearing damage. The creature also has a weak bite that inflicts 1-2 points of damage.</div><div class='indent'>Creatures or characters engaged in melee combat with the kalothagh must roll a Dexterity check (with a +2 bonus applied to the Dexterity score) for each round of combat. A creature or character who tails the Dexterity check has been impaled on one of the kalothagh’s spines and suffers 1-2 points of damage. The impaled victim has a 50% chance per round of freeing himself if he takes no actions other than attempting to pry himself loose; if successful, he risks suffering additional tearing damage from the hooked barbs as described above. If he does not free himself, he suffers an additional 1-2 for each subsequent round he remains impaled on the spine.</div><div class='indent'>The spines of the kalothagh contain a weak poison; those struck by the spines roll saving throws vs. poison with a +4 bonus. If the victim fails the saving throw, he suffers an additional 2 points of damage from the attack, and a +2 penalty to his Armor Class for the next 2d6 hours A victim can only be affected once by the poison of a particular kalothagh within the same 24-hour period.</div><div class='indent'>Though kalothagh are not devoid of intelligence, they seldom make coordinated attacks. They avoid potential enemies that are excessively large or appear to be especially ferocious. Because of their passive nature, kalothagh do not fight among themselves for prey; all kalothagh that bring down a victim share in the feast.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> Kalothagh can be found in all the oceans of Krynn, though they prefer warm waters to cold. They make crude lairs in underwater caves or depressions in the ocean floors and line them with shiny gems collected from sunken ships or stolen from the treasure caches of other ocean dwellers. Kalothagh seldom stray more than a mile or so from their lairs.</div><div class='indent'>Thanks to their spines, mating always ends in the death of the male. Females lay 10d6 spiny eggs at once a process that always ends in the death of the female.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> The kalothagh has little commercial value–in fact, sailors consider a belly-up kalothagh floating on the surface to be an omen of economic disaster. Because of the weak poison that permeates its body, the kalothagh is inedible. Certain primitive tribes carefully snap the spines from dead kalothagh and use them for weapons. Some have attempted to use their air bladders as containers for liquids, but the bladders tend to decay within a few weeks after removal. The carnivorous kalothagh subsists on all varieties of prey.</div>",

    "Description": "<div>In their usual form, kani dolls are created by members of primitive tribes to serve as simple good-luck charms; they have no life of their own. However, when enchanted by evil forces, they become chillingly relentless killers.</div><div class='indent'>Kani dolls are crude representations of humans and animals, most commonly constructed from wood, cloth, feathers, grass, and other cheap, easily available materials. A doll’s form indicates its alleged charm–a rabbit doll, for instance, supposedly gives speed to its owner’s legs, while a raccoon supposedly improves its owner’s dexterity. The dolls are quite detailed; kani dolls in the shape of a bird are covered with hundreds of tiny feathers meticulously sewn into the cloth, while kani dolls in the shape of a rabbit are covered with actual rabbit fur.</div><div class='indent'>In most cases, a kani doll has no actual magical properties and is no more useful than any other superstitious totem. However, it is possible to enchant the dolls to grant the charms represented by their forms. The power of enchanted kani dolls is directly related to the artistry of its creation. Many people can make attractive, authentic-looking dolls, but the rituals required to actually charm a doll are known only to a few wizards in Krynn’s most remote tribes. It takes about a month for a skilled creator to make a kani doll.</div><div class='indent'>Certain tribal mages are able to enchant the dolls with evil forces. When a kani doll is perverted to evil, it attacks that which it has been charmed to enhance. Thus, a rabbit doll might try to chew its victim’s hamstrings, while a raccoon doll might mutilate its victim’s hands. Normal kani dolls are harmless and inanimate; the statistics listed above refer to the animated perversions.</div><div class='indent'>The enchantments of kani dolls activate them at specific times. For instance, a cat doll might activate seven nights after it was given as a gift while a rabbit doll might activate only during a full moon.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> A kani doll always attacks with its mouth or beak. If it scores a hit, it inflicts 1d4 points of damage, then continues to chew, causing an additional 1 point of damage per round until it is destroyed or its purpose is achieved. Certain kani dolls might be instructed to protect a particular area from intruders, while others might be instructed to attack the first person or creature they see, pursuing if necessary. Since a kani doll has no mind, it knows no tear. Thus, it never checks morale, always pressing relentlessly to its target.</div><div class='indent'>The movement and Armor Class statistics listed above do not necessary apply to all kani dolls. These statistics can vary according to the craftsmanship of a particular doll and the materials from which it was made. A well-crafted rabbit doll might have a movement rate of 12, while a hawk doll made of feathers might be able to fly at a movement rate of 6 (B). A turtle doll might have an AC of 9, but crawl at a movement rate of 2.</div><div class='indent'>Following are some typical dolls, their typical movement rates, and their ACs. Each doll’s alleged charm is also listed (but the dolls don’t actually have these properties).</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Kani Doll Characteristics</b></div><br><div><table><thead><tr><th>Form</th><th>Alleged Charm</th><th>Movement</th><th>AC</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Rabbit</td><td>Speed</td><td>12</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Turtle</td><td>Safety</td><td>2</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Hawk</td><td>Sight</td><td>Fl 6 (B)</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Cat</td><td>Stealth</td><td>12</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Great cat</td><td>Courage</td><td>15</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Dove</td><td>Love</td><td>Fl 3 (B)</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Bear</td><td>Strength</td><td>12</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Owl</td><td>Wisdom</td><td>Fl 3 (B)</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Raccoon</td><td>Dexterity</td><td>9</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Human</td><td>Luck</td><td>12</td><td>10</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> Kani dolls can be found in the villages of primitive tribes throughout Krynn.

However, submerged or buried kani dolls remain active, ready to strike at anyone unfortunate enough to encounter them.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Aside from their use as good luck charms, some primitive cultures use kani dolls as toys for their children, or bury them with their dead to offer protection in the afterlife.

    "Description": "<div>Kender are diminutive humanoids who are insatiably curious and utterly fearless, with an uncanny knack for getting into trouble.</div><div class='indent'>Kender resemble human children, though more heavily muscled. Males are typically 3’ 7” tall and weigh 75 pounds; females are slightly smaller. Adult kender rarely exceed four feet tall or weigh more than 100 pounds. Kender have distinctive pointed ears that give them an elven appearance. They have sandy blonde, light brown, dark brown, copper-red, or red-orange hair, usually worn long with many varieties of braids and ponytails. Feathers, ribbons, flowers, and other colorful items are often woven into their hair. Kender are fair-skinned, but they tan quickly, becoming dark brown by mid-summer. Their eyes are variously pale blue, olive, light brown, and hazel.</div><div class='indent'>Kender have been called wizened because of the fine network of lines that creases their faces beginning at age 40. Their facial expressions are quite intense; no one seems as happy as a joyful kender or as miserable as a weeping one.</div><div class='indent'>Kender clothing varies widely, but tends to be colorful and bright. Soft leather is a particularly favored material for clothing, especially if dyed bright colors and tooled with designs. Kender carry a mind-boggling assortment of small items in their pockets and belt pouches, such as bird feathers, animal teeth, rings, string, handkerchiefs, small tools, pet mice, oddly shaped twigs, foreign coins, and bits of dried meat. Anything that conceivably could hold a kender’s attention for more than a few seconds will likely find its way into his pocket, with or without the actual owners permission.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Kender fight hard and relentlessly, sometimes coming up with unexpected tactics that can carry the day for their companions. They are immune to all forms of fear, including magical fear, and make saving throws against spells and poison with a +4 bonus. When alone and not outfitted in armor, kender cause a -4 penalty to opponents’ surprise rolls.</div><div class='indent'>The kender’s most effective defense is their ability to enrage opponents by taunting them with verbal abuse. Any creature taunted by a kender for one full round must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell or attack wildly for 1d10 rounds at a -2 penalty to attack rolls and a +2 penalty to Armor Class.</div><div class='indent'>Kender employ a variety of weapons, and receive a +3 attack roll bonus when using slings or bows. Their favorite weapon is the hoopak, a special combination of a bo staff and staff sling. Made from resilient wood, one end of the hoopak is forked like a slingshot and has a leather pocket mounted between the forks. The other end is pointed and shod with metal or hardened by fire. When used as a sling, it causes 1d4 + 1 points of damage against small opponents and 1d6+1 points of damage against large opponents. When used as a staff, it causes 1d6 points of damage against small opponents and ld4 points of damage against large opponents.</div><div class='indent'>Most kender do not tolerate armor any heavier than leather or padded. Some may use ring mail or studded leather, but only for short periods. If an adventuring party is lost in the wilderness, kender have a 50% chance of determining the correct direction.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> The basic unit of kender society is the family consisting of parents and their children A kender child stays with his parents until his early 20s, at which time he becomes subject to wanderlust. A kender experiencing wanderlust is overwhelmed by his natural curiosity and desire for action he is compelled to wander the land as far as he can go. Wanderlust may last until the kender reaches his 50s or 60s, at which time he enters a life-phase called rooting–a compulsion to settle down with a mate and raise a child or two. This cycle of wanderlust and rooting is responsible for spreading kender communities across the continent of Ansalon.</div><div class='indent'>Kender seldom have more than two offspring. A second child is never conceived until the first leaves home with wanderlust. Thus the parents give their undivided attention to each child.</div><div class='indent'>An entire kender family lives in the same house, usually no more than a single room, comfortably furnished with stuffed cushions and wooden furniture. Building materials include whatever is available; kender have developed quite a knack for creating attractive homes from odd collections of stone, wood, brick, and thatch. No kender home contains locks of any kind.</div><div class='indent'>Kender communities are democratic to the point of anarchy–every citizen is more or less allowed to do whatever he pleases. Kender see no reason to impose their views on anyone else. Since evil kender do not exist, there is little need for laws or a formal government. When an emergency arises that requires cooperation from the kender, they do so naturally; with minimal preparation, they can become a formidable, unified group.</div><div class='indent'>This is not to say that the idea of government is totally without its appeal for kender. They have experimented with every conceivable form of government and are more than willing to give any new type a chance. They also follow any leader for as long as he remains interesting. Owing to the kender.s low tolerance for boredom, a new government or new leader seldom holds their attention for more than a few days.</div><div class='indent'>There has never been a standing kender army. The occasional invaders attempting to occupy a kender village quickly became discouraged: not only were the kender tearless fighters, there was nothing much of interest in the village worth plundering, and the kender made hopelessly inept slaves. In fact, most kender find an enemy occupation to be a tremendous boost to the local economy, since the invaders always bring such interesting things for the kender to “handle”.</div><div class='indent'>Though always welcome, non-kender visitors seldom stay longer than a week in a kender village–life among the kender is just too frustrating. It is not uncommon for a visitor to be relieved of all of his possessions within a few hours. Visitors are pelted by a constant barrage of questions and rambling, pointless stories.</div><div class='indent'>Kender can be endearingly charming or shockingly vulgar. They are natural extroverts and enjoy making new acquaintances.</div><div class='indent'>Though most are personable and friendly, they can also be obnoxiously talkative and nosy. Since kender do what they want when they want to do it, they resent being given orders. At the same time, kender are quite sensitive and can be easily hurt by indifference or intentionally cutting remarks.</div><div class='indent'>Kender treasure their friends; if a kender’s friend is injured or slain, the kender is usually overcome with grief and despair. Death is only meaningful to a kender when it comes to one whom the kender knows and loves, such as a family member or an adventuring companion, or when it strikes innocents, such as the victims of warfare or a natural disaster. In these cases, the anguish felt by the usually cheerfully kender is heart wrenching to behold–the depression lingers for days or even months after the event.</div><div class='indent'>The concept of delayed gratification is alien to kender. They thrive on excitement and yearn for new adventures. Some kender believe that evil creatures are condemned to an afterlife where they will be bored for all eternity.</div><div class='indent'>The kender’s innate fearlessness gives them remarkable confidence. They remain calm and carefree even in the most life-threatening situations. The combination of fearlessness, uncontrollable curiosity, and impulsiveness invariably gets them into trouble, as they are forever peeking into dark corners and forging ahead into unexplored places. Kender often allow their curiosity to overcome what common sense they possess, especially when encountering an unusual monster. When a kender displays an uncommonly sensible attitude in a dangerous situation, it is probably because he realizes that death means never doing anything interesting again.</div><div class='indent'>Kender have a unique approach to personal property and theft. Their intense curiosity feeds their desire to know how locks can be opened, how to listen in on other’s conversations, and how to reach into pockets to find interesting things to look at. Thieving comes naturally to kender, and they see nothing wrong with it; what others might call “stealing”, kender call “handling”. Kender do not steal for the sake of profit, since they have little concept of value; they are just as happy with a chunk of purple glass as they are with a glittering diamond. Often they pick up an item out of curiosity and forget to return it. If caught red-handed with another’s property, they offer an amazing range of excuses: “I forgot I had it”–“I found it”–“I was afraid someone else would take it.” More often than not, kender believe their excuses to be the truth. Ironically, kender dislike the idea of someone deliberately taking an item without the owner’s permission; to be called a thief is considered a base insult.</div><div class='indent'>Kender cannot learn to cast wizard spells because of their innate magical resistance, a legacy of their creation.</div><div class='indent'>No evil kender are known to exist.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Most races shun kender, finding their personalities and societies hard to tolerate. On the other hand kender have no prejudices and welcome the opportunity to socialize with outsiders, finding their customs and habits to be quite fascinating.</div><div class='indent'>Kender are as curious about food as they are about everything else, and they consume anything that looks remotely edible. They are actually quite skilled chefs, and two of their recipes account for their only tradable goods. One is called dew drink, an alcoholic beverage distilled from sundews, gold in color with the flavor of honey.

    "Description": "<div>A death knight is the horrifying corruption of a Knight of Solamnia, cursed by the gods to its terrible form as punishment for betraying the code of honor it held in its former life.</div><div class='indent'>A death knight resembles a hulking knight, typically taller than six feet and weighing more than 300 pounds. Its face is a blackened skull covered with shards of shriveled, rotting flesh. It has two tiny, glowing orange-red pinpoints for eyes. Its armor is scorched black as if it had been in a fire. The demeanor of a death knight is so terrifying that even kender have been known to become frightened.</div><div class='indent'>A death knight’s deep, chilling voice seems to echo from the depths of a bottomless cavern. A death knight converses in the language it spoke in its former life, as well as up to six additional languages.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> A death knight retains the fighting skills it had in its former life. Since it has little regard for its own safety and an intense hatred of most living creatures, it is an extremely dangerous opponent. Still, a death knight retains a semblance of the pride it held as a Knight of Solamnia and fights honorably: It never ambushes opponents from behind, nor does it attack before an opponent has an opportunity to ready his weapon. Surrender is unknown to a death knight, and it will parley only if it senses its opponent has crucial information (such as the fate of a former family member).</div><div class='indent'>A death knight has a strength of 18(00). It usually attacks with a sword; 80% of the time, this is a magical sword. When a magical sword is indicated, roll 1d6 and consult the following table:<table><thead><tr><th>Roll</th><th>Death Knight’s Sword</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td><i>Long sword +2</i></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td><i>Two-handed sword +3</i></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td><i>Two-handed sword +4</i></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td><i>Short sword of quickness</i></td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td><i>Short sword of dancing</i></td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td><i>Short sword of life stealing</i></td></tr></tbody></table></div></br/><div>A death knight wears the same armor it wore in its previous life, but regardless of the quality of the armor, it always has an AC of 0. Hit points for a death knight are determined by rolling 10-sided dice.</div><div class='indent'>A death knight’s magical abilities make it especially dangerous. It constantly generates <i>fear</i> in a five-foot radius, and it can cast <i>detect magic</i>, <i>detect invisibility</i>, and <i>wall of ice</i> at will. Twice per day, it can cast <i>dispel magic</i>. Once per day, it can use either <i>power word, blind</i>, <i>power word, kill</i>, or <i>power word, stun</i>. It can also cast <i>symbol of fear</i> or <i>symbol of pain</i> once per day, as well as a 20-dice <i>fireball</i> once per day. All of its magical spells function at the 20th level of ability.</div><div class='indent'>A death knight cannot be turned, but it can be dispelled by <i>holy word</i> spell. It has the power over undead of a 6th-level evil priest. Its magic resistance is 75%, and if an 11 or lower is rolled on the percentile roll, the spell is reflected back at the caster (the magic resistance is rerolled each time a spell is cast at a death knight).</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> The death knights of Krynn are former Knights of Solamnia who were judged by the gods to be guilty of unforgivable crimes, such as murder or treason. (For instance, Lord Soth, the most famous of all death knights, murdered his wife so that he could continue an affair with an elfmaid.) Death knights are cursed to remain in their former domains, usually castles or other strongholds. They are further condemned to remember their crime in song on any night when one of Krynn’s three moons is full: few sounds are as terrifying as a death knight’s chilling melody echoing through the moonlit countryside. Death knights are likely to attack any creature that interrupts their songs or trespasses in their domains.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Death knights have no physiological functions. They are sometimes accompanied by skeleton warriors, liches, and other undead who serve as their aides.</div>",

    "Description": "<div>Kyrie are an ancient race of bird-men. Small in numbers, their primary holdings are a few high, steep-walled valleys along the main mountain ridge of Mithas, homeland of the minotaurs.</div><div class='indent'>Resembling a bizarre mix of hawk and human, a mature kyrie stands upright on long wiry legs ending in bird-like claws. Its arms are actually wings, though it they have human hands with long, thin fingers ending in talons. The back and wings of a kyrie are covered with brown feathers; the chest is covered with soft, golden fur. The kyrie has a human torso and a human head with a small nose, thin lips, and tiny eyes, usually light blue or yellow.</div><div class='indent'>On the average, kyrie are taller than humans, though much lighter. With a hollow bone structure and thin but wiry musculature it is rare for one of these creatures to reach 100 pounds in weight. Kyrie are nimble fliers with powerful wings. They can climb in the air at a rate of 3.</div><div class='indent'>In addition to their own language, 80% of kyrie speak the common language. They speak in a clipped and precise, but understandable, fashion.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Normally, kyrie are peaceful and passive. But they are fierce and proud, with a low tolerance for trespassers and no tolerance for aggressors. They do not allow themselves to be taken prisoner, in all cases preferring death to subjugation.</div><div class='indent'>A kyrie can make one claw attack per round to inflict 1d6points of damage, but they more often use simple weapons. For instance, a kyrie often carries one or two fist-sized stones when flying. A favorite combat tactic is to drop these stones on an opponent, one per round, for 1d8 points of damage with each successful hit. After a kyrie has attacked with its stones, it lands and melees with the lightweight stone axe carried by all adult kyrie. The axe inflicts 1d6 points of damage.</div><div class='indent'>Kyrie are also capable of casting spells as 3rd-level druids. The most common spells used by kyrie are <i>animal friendship</i>, <i>invisibility to animals</i>, <i>predict weather</i>, <i>charm person or mammal</i>, <i>warp wood</i>, and <i>hold animal</i>. However, kyrie are not limited to just these particular spells. In tact, all 1st- to 3rd-level spells available to druids can be learned by kyrie.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> Kyrie originally inhabited numerous islands around the periphery of Ansalon. They migrated from island to island, completing a circuit of the world over the course of several decades. Their long, soaring flights over the expansive oceans of Krynn were made possible by a magical device called the Northstone that enabled their leaders to keep track of direction. By depending on this device, kyrie gradually lost the ability to navigate on their own. A few years ago, they lost the Northstone to the minotaurs, effectively stranding the kyrie in their primary homes in Mithas. Though they eventually recovered the Northstone, they chose to remain on Mithas. in spite of the minotaurs’ hostility, defiantly claiming they had as much right to the island as the minotaurs.</div><div class='indent'>Kyrie lairs, called aeries, are located in caves high on the most inaccessible mountain peaks or mid-way on sheer cliffs. An aerie is a clean and pleasant nest of twigs and branches, offering a spectacular view of the surrounding mountains. Each aerie contains as many as 3d6 mature kyrie, equally split between males and females, and 4d6 kyrie young. They have little in the way of possessions, except for their stone axes and a supply of rocks to use as missiles or bombs. They enjoy coins and gems, which they collect more for beauty than value.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> The mortal enemies of kyrie are minotaurs. Kyrie sometimes raid isolated minotaur mining villages and supply caravans, killing them ruthlessly and stealing their food and weapons. The minotaurs retaliate by assaulting the kyrie’s aeries.</div><div class='indent'>Kyrie eat rodents, seeds, and fruit. They have a special fondness for wine and other strong drink, which they steal from the minotaurs. Most creatures find the tough kyrie eggs to be inedible, but minotaurs mix the yolks with mutton fat to make a thick soup.</div>",

    "Description": "<div>Jarak-sinn are a vile race of lizard men devoted to the worship of Chislev. All civilized races avoid associating with the vulgar, vicious, foul jarak.sinn. The bakali are the forefathers of the jarak-sinn; though not as numerous as the jarak-sinn, a few communities of bakali still remain in Ansalon, with more in Taladas.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Jarak-Sinn</b></div><br/><div>Jarak-sinn are stoop-shouldered, thick-bodied creatures covered from head to toe with thin, green scales. A bony ridge extends from their broad snouts, between their eyes, and runs down their spines. They have whip-like tails, which average four to five feet long. They have sharp, hooked teeth and long claws on their hands and feet. Their small eyes are either red or pink in color, and their eyelids are clear, giving them the appearance of always having their eyes open. Thick pink tongues nearly two feet long dangle limply from the sides of their mouths: unlike snakes and other reptiles, their tongues have no sensory functions.</div><div class='indent'>Jarak-sinn wear few clothes. The king, knights, and priests wear thick leather collars, respectively studded with gems, copper bands, and chunks of bone to distinguish them from the rest of the tribe. Many jarak.sinn wear bone necklaces and bracelets. Others etch crude tattoos into their scales using red-hot dagger blades.</div><div class='indent'>Their language consists of short bursts of hisses, growls, and rasps. About 15% of the jarak.sinn can understand common language, and about 5% can make themselves understood to other intelligent races, albeit on a rudimentary level.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Jarak-sinn love combat and eagerly embrace every opportunity to engage in bloodshed. Though jarak-sinn pride themselves on their combat skills, they are by no means sophisticated fighters. A typical assault amounts to little more than a forward charge followed by fierce melee. If jarak.sinn face clearly superior opponents, they may refrain from charging, lurking in the shadows or other cover until they can ambush their victims from behind.</div><div class='indent'>In addition to their claw and bite attacks, jarak-sinn use a variety of weapons, short swords and long swords being their favorites. They also use daggers javelins, and clubs studded with sharp pieces of bone (to cause 2d4 points of damage). They never wear armor, but occasionally employ small shields to raise their AC to 4.</div><div class='indent'>The jarak-sinn’s spittle is a thick, acidic venom that inflicts burns on all creatures other than lizard men. They sometimes coat their weapons with this venomous spittle, victims struck with a spittle-coated weapon must roll successful saving throws vs. poison or suffer an additional 1d4 points of damage. Since they lack the necessary jaw muscles, jarak-sinn are unable to spew their spittle at opponents.</div><div class='indent'>A jarak-sinn can strike opponents from behind, using its tail like a whip to inflict 1d4 points of damage. A jarak-sinn can detach this appendage at will; if an opponent grabs his tail, the opponent may find himself struggling with a writhing tail while the jarak-sinn flees to safety A new tail can be grown in 1d4+8 weeks.</div><div class='indent'>About 15% of jarak-sinn have two loose flaps of skin on either side of their necks that they can inflate to the size of three-foot-diameter balloons, these swellings are sometimes effective in discouraging predators. About 25% of jarak.sinn tan emit loud hisses to frighten opponents; although most intelligent opponents are not impressed with these sounds, unintelligent animals often associate the sounds with those made by poisonous snakes or small dragons, thus making them think twice before attacking.</div><div class='indent'>Jarak.sinn occasionally ride giant lizards into battle. The notoriously uncooperative lizards obey only the simplest of commands, but they are effective mounts when jarak-sinn are attacking opponents the lizards perceive as edible. The lizards relentlessly pursue such opponents, gobbling them up as soon as they run them down.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> When the gods created the dragons, the elves, and other races at the dawn of time, Chislev decided to create his own race for the specific purpose of worshiping him. Thus were born the bakali, a race of loathsome lizard men that crawled from the Great Moors of northern Ansalon and proceeded to establish small colonies in swamps and tropical regions throughout the land. The other races of Krynn, however, did not take kindly to the bakali; though not particularly aggressive, bakali habitually kidnapped innocent citizens to sacrifice to Chislev. Bakali were no match for the more intelligent and better-armed races. They were eventually forced to withdraw to Ansalon.s most desolate swamps, from which they ventured only rarely.</div><div class='indent'>Adding to the bakali’s problems were their diminishing numbers. While the other races grew and flourished, the bakali population could barely sustain itself; war and disease both took their toll. Additionally, bakali females produced only a single egg every five years. Desperately, the bakali petitioned Chislev for help. Chislev responded by creating a new species of lizard men he called the jarak-sinn; for the next 50 years, all offspring of female bakali were members of this more prolific species.</div><div class='indent'>When they matured, female jarak.sinn gave birth to their own offspring at the rate of 10-20 per year. The number of jarak-sinn soon matched, then exceeded, the number of bakali.</div><div class='indent'>But as the population of jarak-sinn grew, so did conflicts with the bakali. The first jarak-sinn leader of note–an ambitious, scheming male named Krazak–organized a revolt against the bakali. All bakali the jarak-sinn could find were rounded up and systematically executed. Some bakali managed to escape, fleeing in crude boats to the open sea. Eventually these last remnants of the bakali race came upon the continent of Taladas. Once there they quickly established themselves in Blackwater Glade and began to grow in numbers in the relative safety of that dismal swamp. Rumors persist that there are still some bakali yet alive in Ansalon, as the rulers of the less-intelligent jarak-sinn recognize their usefulness as advisors.</div><div class='indent'>Jarak-sinn settlements have few of the elements normally associated with a civilized society. There are no formal laws–all decisions are made by the king, whose judgments can be as arbitrary as they are cruel. Homes are little more than mud pits or filth-strewn caves, which the jarak-sinn share with snakes, rats, and other vermin. Jarak.sinn lack the ambition to master any useable skills aside from those that are combat-related; consequently, a jarak-sinn settlement has no craftsmen, merchants, or artists.</div><div class='indent'>A king seldom reigns more than a few years before he is assassinated; his assassin becomes the new king. The king always surrounds himself with 1d4+6 bodyguards, referred to as knights; knights are selected for their strength (they have a minimum of 15 hit points) and trustworthiness, although kings are usually assassinated by one of their own knights.</div><div class='indent'>The community’s shamans are in charge of conducting services in the name of Chislev. A shaman always has the spellcasting abilities of a 3rd.level shaman and has 1d4 acolytes with the spellcasting abilities of 1st.level shamans. There is usually one shaman for every 20 members of a tribe.</div><div class='indent'>Tribal members who are not knights, shamans, or acolytes are all considered members of the community militia–all children capable of wielding a weapon (age 10 and up with a minimum of 5 hp) are considered mature enough to fight.</div><div class='indent'>Jarak-sinn spend most of their time eating, sleeping, or cooling themselves in mud pits. When the dark moon of Nuitari is in High Sanction (full moon), which occurs for a seven-day period every month, the shamans lead the jarak-sinn in elaborate worship services to Chislev, involving chants, prayers, and numerous slave sacrifices.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Though few know of the existence of the jarak-sinn, those who do despise and fear them. The shadowpeople, who occupy many of the underground caverns coveted by the jarak-sinn, especially hate them.</div><div class='indent'>Jarak-sinn eat small mammals, algae and fungus, human flesh, and each other. They can unhinge their jaws to swallow large prey, such as sheep, though this process is time-consuming (up to four hours to swallow a sheep) and somewhat painful. Their sour flesh is inedible, as are their gelatinous eggs: hence, jarak-sinn are avoided by predators. Their hides can be re-worked by skilled armorers to make scale armor (AC 6).</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Bakali</b></div><br/><div>Bakali range from slightly shorter than most jarak-sinn to slightly taller. Their hides vary from yellow-green to mottled brown in color. Otherwise they are similar in appearance to the jarak-sinn. Although the bakali are the more intelligent species, the jarak-sinn consider them inferior in every respect.</div><div class='indent'>Bakali are distrustful and suspicious by nature. They tend to keep to themselves and seldom leave their territories. To others they seem savage and cruel; as a race, they have no compunctions against violence, though individuals may hold more tolerant views.</div><div class='indent'>Though frequently hostile to humans, bakali have a strong sense of honor. They remember both the good and the ill done to them, and they treat others as others treat them. They place great store in friendships, both among their own kind and with those of other races.</div><div class='indent'>Although they are warm-blooded, bakali are vulnerable to cold and suffer 1 extra point of damage per die of damage caused by a cold-based attack. Their tough hides serve as the equivalent of AC 7. They are able to move equally well in the water and on land. Bakali do not possess infravision. They do have special nictating membranes that can quickly shield their eyes from harm. Thus they gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws against effects that involve blinding or dazzling of the eyes.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Bakali Class Limits</b></div><br/><div><table><thead><tr><th>Class</th><th>Max.

Note that primitive groups, such as the more unsophisticated tribes, are notoriously sexist, and one is unlikely to find women in positions of leadership, except in matriarchal societies.</div><br/><div><h2 style=’color:#4169E1’>Ice Folk</h2>The ice folk are a race of rugged warriors inhabiting some of the most desolate arctic regions of Krynn.</div><div class='indent'>Ice folk are tall, heavyset humans with leathery skin and long, flowing hair, usually red or light brown. They wear white fur parkas and boots to protect them from the bitterly cold weather. They are fierce and proud.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Ice folk are peace-loving by nature; however, aggressive actions from opponents spark the ice folk to fight to the death. Ice folk arm themselves with clubs, maces, battle axes, and special weapons called <i>frostreavers</i>.</div><div class='indent'>A <i>frostreaver</i> is a <i>heavy battle axe +4</i> made out of ice. It can be created only by the Revered Cleric of each tribe and requires a month to make. A <i>frostreaver</i> can be wielded only by a character with a Strength of 13 or greater. Temperatures above freezing cause the <i>frostreaver</i> to melt, rendering it worthless.</div><div class='indent'>Ice folk use iceboats, huge vessels with canvas sails and wooden runners, to glide along the surface of the ice at speeds much faster than a man can run. A typical iceboat carries about 15 riders.</div><div class='indent'>Ice folk seldom wear metal armor, but their bulky furs give them an effective AC of 5.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> An average ice folk tribe includes about 100 members. The wisest and strongest member, a 12th-level or higher fighter, serves as chief. The chief has 1d6 personal guards (10th- to 12th-level fighters) who inflict 1d8+4 points of damage with every successful hit. The tribe’s highest-level cleric (5th level or higher) serves as the Revered Cleric, he has 1d4 acolytes (1st-to 3rd-level clerics). The rest of the tribe is equally divided between 1st- to 4th-level fighters and level 0 workers, children, and elderly.</div><div class='indent'>An ice folk village is a collection of circular huts covered by bulky white furs, making it almost invisible against the snow. Each hut houses a family of as many as 20 members. Furnishings are simple, little more than a fire pit for heat and cooking and fur rugs for sleeping. Ice folk villages are often protected by large snow fences made from the rib bones of gigantic creatures. The ice folk are nomadic, settling in one place for about a year, and moving on when the fish supply reaches dangerously low levels.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> The ice folk are fishers and hunters, ice bears being a favorite source of meat and fur. They keep tubs of slimy grease made from walrus blubber for cooking and for lubricating the runners of their iceboats. Aside from the ice bears, they have few natural enemies, except for on.going territorial conflicts with the thanoi. The ice folk seldom have the opportunity to engage in trade.</div><br/><div><h2 style=’color:#4169E1’>Knights of Solamnia</h2><br/>The Knights of Solamnia are the noblest of Krynn.s heroes. Their philosophy is best summed up by the oath to which all Knights subscribe: My Honor is My Life.</div><div class='indent'>Since the time of Huma, the Knights of Solamnia had stood as symbols for all that was good. Rut following the Cataclysm, when the common people cried out for aid, the Knights were powerless to help. The people blamed the Knights for their perceived inaction. The Knights fell into disgrace, and their temples and fortresses were besieged.</div><div class='indent'>The Knights who remained were forced to roam the countryside in secret, fearful that they would be discovered by an angry citizenry. Still, the Knights held true to their ideals and did what they could to tight the evil in the world. To this day, the only sizeable group of Knights exists on the distant Sancrist Isle. The rest operate covertly, concentrated in the villages and cities of Solamnia, a sprawling realm in northwest Ansalon.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Hierarchy:</b> The Knights of Solamnia are organized into three Orders: the Knights of the Crown, the Knights of the Sword, and the Knights of the Rose. Individual cells of Knights, called Circles, have been established throughout Ansalon. These Circles exist permanently in many townships and in virtually every major city in the continent. The Circles exist to give aid to all local Knights. Some of these Circles, especially the ones in Solamnia and Sancrist, operate openly and are easy to find. In places where the Knighthood is still viewed suspiciously, these Circles exist clandestinely and their meetings are held in secret.</div><div class='indent'>The Knighthood is ruled by the Lord of the Knights. However, this position has remained vacant since the time of the Cataclysm due to the difficulties in calling together a Grand Circle of Knights in sufficient numbers to elect a Lord from the eligible candidates. The position must be filled by either the High Warrior, the High Clerist, or the High Justice (see tables below), and at least 75% of the established Circles must send two representatives to vote.</div><div class='indent'>The will of the Lord of Knights is carried out by the High Knights throughout their respective orders, The High Warrior commands the Order of the Crown, the High Clerist commands the Order of the Sword, and the High Justice commands the Order of the Rose. These are nominated and elected by members of their own Orders without influence from the other two Orders. A Knightly Council, a group responsible for matters of pressing importance, must be held by a contingent of three ranking knights, one from each of the Orders.</div><div class='indent'>Knights of the Crown are sworn to protect, serve, and give aid to any kingdom on the List of Loyalty. This list is maintained by the three High Knights and is updated periodically. The Knights are not required to follow the commands or laws of these kingdoms should they violate the standards of the Knights’ personal code.</div><div class='indent'>All those who wish to become Solamnic Knights must first enter into the Knighthood as squires of the Knights of the Crown. This is true regardless of what Knighthood they will eventually serve. Specific requirements and abilities of each Order are given below. Solamnic Knights are variants of paladins as described in the 2nd Edition <i>Player’s Handbook</i>. However, there are many important differences, and the following material should be read carefully.</div><div class='indent'>The Solamnic Knight Ability Table lists the minimum scores for each Order. Since all Knights begin as Knights of the Crown, note that a Knight with the minimum scores is unable to progress into the higher Orders. Levels, titles, and Hit Dice for each Order are summarized on the Solamnic Knight Level Table.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Solamnic Knight Ability Table (Minimum Scores)</b><br/><table><thead><tr><th>Ability</th><th>Crown Knight</th><th>Sword Knight</th><th>Rose Knight</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strength</td><td>10</td><td>12</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Dexterity</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Constitution</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Intelligence</td><td>7</td><td>9</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Wisdom</td><td>10</td><td>13</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Charisma</td><td>None</td><td>None</td><td>None</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Solamnic Knight Level Table</b><br/><table><thead><tr><th>Lvl.</th><th>HD (d10s)</th><th>Crown Title</th><th>Sword Title</th><th>Rose Title</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>Squire of Crown</td><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>Defender of Crown</td><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>Knight of Crown</td><td>Novice of Swords</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>Scepter Knight</td><td>Knight of Swords</td><td>Novice of Roses</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>Shield Knight</td><td>Blade Knight</td><td>Knight of Tears</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>Shield of Crown</td><td>Knight Clerist</td><td>Knight of Mind</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>Lord of Shields</td><td>Abbot of Swords</td><td>Knight of Heart</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>Lord of Crown</td><td>Elder of Swords</td><td>Knight of Roses</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>10</td><td>Master Warrior</td><td>Keeper of Roses</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>10+2</td><td>Lord Warrior</td><td>Lord of Swords</td><td>Master of Roses</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>10+4</td><td>High Warrior*</td><td>Master Clerist</td><td>Archknight</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>10+6</td><td>–</td><td>Lord Clerist</td><td>Lord of Roses</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>l0+8</td><td>–</td><td>High Clerist*</td><td>Master of Justice</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>10+10</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>Lord of Justice</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>10+12</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>High Justice*</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>10+14</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>l0+16</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>l0+18</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr></tbody></table>* There is only one High Warrior, High Clerist, or High Justice in each Order.

A candidate must swear an oath to the honor of the Knighthood and to the causes of the Crown, and swear allegiance to the Order and the ideals of the Knights of Solamnia. If there is no dissent from the Knights, and no question of honor regarding the candidate is presented, then the candidate is accepted into the Knighthood as a squire Knights of the Crown begin with three weapon proficiencies and two nonweapon proficiencies, adding one of each for every two levels of advancement. They are allowed to use weapon specialization, but they do not gain any of the special abilities of the paladin listed in the 2nd Edition <i>Player’s Handbook</i>.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Knights of the Sword:</b> A Knight can attempt to enter this Order only after first rising to Defender of the Crown and only if he has the minimum acceptable ability scores. The candidate is brought before a Knightly Council at which a Sword Knight of no less than 7th level is one of the three presiding Knights. It there is no question of honor brought up, the candidate is assigned a complex quest to test his compassion, his wisdom, his generosity, and his combat skills. If successful, the Knight becomes a Novice in the Order.</div><div class='indent'>Knights of the Sword begin with three weapon and two nonweapon proficiencies (in addition to the proficiencies already obtained as a Crown Knight), adding one nonweapon and two weapon proficiencies for every two levels of advancement. Sword Knights gain all of the special abilities of the paladin listed in the 2nd Edition <i>Player’s Handbook</i>.

The candidate is brought before a Knightly Council at which a Rose Knight of no less than 9th level is one of the three presiding Knights. If there is no question of honor brought up, the candidate is assigned a complex quest to test his compassion, his wisdom, his generosity, and his combat skills. If successful, the Knight becomes a Novice in the Order.</div><div class='indent'>Knights of the Rose begin with three weapon and two nonweapon proficiencies (in addition to the proficiencies already obtained as a Crown and a Sword Knight), adding one nonweapon and two weapon proficiencies for every two levels of advancement.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Solamnic Knights are fighters of unparalleled courage and honor. Their highest ideal is to meet a noble death against overwhelming odds in the cause of justice. They retreat only if they can be persuaded that a larger interest is at stake.</div><div class='indent'>The Knights employ a variety of weapons. The most frequently used are bows and swords of all kinds, lances, battle axes, and spears. Crown Knights of 6th level or higher have a 10% chance of having a magical weapon. Sword Knights of 6th level and Rose Knights of 5th level have a 10% base chance of having a magical weapon: for Sword Knights, this chance increases 10% per level above 6th, up to a maximum of 40%, and for Rose Knights the chance increases 10% per level above 5th to a maximum of 70%. All Knights wear a variety of armor, but chain mail with a shield is the most common.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> Though a Circle may comprise 50.100 or more members, it is rare that an outsider encounters this many Knights at any one time. More commonly, a solitary Knight or a patrol of 2d6 is encountered. This usually occurs within 4d10 miles of a village or large city.</div><div class='indent'>When an encounter with Solamnic Knights is indicated, roll 1d6. On a roll of 1-4, a solitary Knight is encountered. On a roll of 5-6, a patrol of 2d6 is encountered. To determine the Order and level of a solitary Knight or a patrol leader (the rest of the patrol is of the same Order as the leader, but a mixture of lower levels), roll ld6 again to determine which column on the Knight Encounter Table to consult; add 1 to the roll if the Knight encounter occurs within the vicinity of a large village, or add 2 if it occurs within the vicinity of a major city (the DM is free to vary these modifiers as he sees fit). On a modified roll of 1-3, use column A; 4-5 = column B; and 6 = column C. Then roll 1d8 and cross-index the result with the appropriate column.</div><div class='indent'>Solamnic Knights seldom carry treasure or other valuables. Most are required to forfeit most or all of their monetary gains to the greater Knighthood, then draw according to their needs.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Knight Encounter Table</b><br/><table><thead><tr><th>D8 Roll</th><th>A</th><th>B</th><th>C</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Crown 2nd</td><td>Crown 6th</td><td>Crown 9th</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Crown 3rd</td><td>Crown 7th</td><td>Sword 9th</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Crown 5th</td><td>Sword 6th</td><td>Sword 10th</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Crown 5th</td><td>Sword 7th</td><td>Rose 6th</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Sword 3rd</td><td>Crown 8th</td><td>Rose 9th</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Sword 4th</td><td>Rose 4th</td><td>Crown 10th</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Sword 5th</td><td>Rose 5th</td><td>Sword 12th</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Rose 5th</td><td>Rose 8th</td><td>Rose 14th</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Few Knights operate openly. They cannot be hired, but they can be recruited for missions to further the common good. Though many are fine metalsmiths and armorers, they seldom sell their wares.</div><br/><div><h2 style=’color:#4169E1’>Plainsman</h2><br/>The plainsmen of Krynn consist of a number of tribes organized into self.contained communities. Most tribes share common ancestry with the plainsmen of Que-shu.</div><div class='indent'>Most plainsmen tribes live in areas of Krynn that are otherwise uninhabited; in fact, many tribes have virtually no contact with any other cultures. Tribal life is basic and uncomplicated, with most resources devoted to the day-to-day problems of survival.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Lahutians</b><br/>This is a tribe of cannibals living in the tropical forests of central and northern Ansalon. The Lahutians are short, stocky race whose pink skin is covered with fine, blond hair. They wear grass and silver necklaces decorated with human finger joints and other small bones They never venture from the forests, traveling in groups of 2d4 to prey on wild animals and unfortunate travelers. They have their own language, an obscure tongue that only 10% of characters with an Intelligence of 15 or higher have a chance of comprehending.</div><div class='indent'>With their special fondness for human flesh, Lahutians attack all humans on sight. Half of an encountered group is armed with spears. The other half wields short bows whose arrows are dipped in a special poison made from sundew sap. This poison causes 1d4 points of damage to victims who fail their saving throws vs. poison. Lahutians wear no armor their AC is 10.</div><div class='indent'>A Lahutian tribe typically comprises about 40 members; half are fighters of 4th level or less, and the rest are level 0 workers, children, and elderly. The Lahutians lack the talent for magic; hence, there are no priests or wizards. The strongest Lahutian rules the tribe by declaring himself to be a god. The ruler demands sacrifices and worship from the other members.</div><div class='indent'>The Lahutians produce no products of value. Their treasure, if any, is seldom more than a small collection of semi-precious stones.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Lor-Tai</b><br/>The Lor-Tai are members of a primitive, docile tribe that inhabits hillside caves in the northern tropics. All have dark skin, fair hair, and almond eyes They are sweet-tempered, non-violent, and not particularly bright. They are open and friendly to strangers and share their food and homes as long as a visitor cares to stay.</div><div class='indent'>The Lor-Tai are inept fighters and always flee from an opponent if given a chance. If cornered, they feebly defend themselves, with staves, the only weapons the tribe employs About 50% are armed with the staves, which inflict 1d6 points of damage. Lor-Tai wear no armor, but their resilient bodies given them a natural AC of 9.</div><div class='indent'>A tribe usually has 20-50 members. No more than 10% are 1st-level fighters; the rest are level 0. Lor-Tai spend their time tending to their sizeable herds of cows and goats. They have an uncanny rapport with nature; all have a natural ability to <i>speak with animals</i> as per the spell. Some are skilled artists, painting colorful portraits of their favorite animals on the wails of their caves. Others are talented musicians, playing beautiful music on stringed instruments made from goat bones and cow gut.</div><div class='indent'>Though the Lor-Tai have no wizards among their number, they have a remarkable aptitude for creating magical potions. If a Lor-Tai tribesmen is given a magical potion to examine, there is a 25% chance he can duplicate it by combining various herbs, roots, and other natural ingredients. This process takes 2d4 days to complete.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Nomads</b><br/>This term refers to all of the various plainsmen groups with no permanent settlements, including those refugees left homeless by war or natural disasters. Some roam the countryside in search of new homelands, others have adapted to the nomadic way of life and drift from place to place.</div><div class='indent'>A group of nomads consists of 2d10 members.</div><div class='indent'>About half are level 0, the rest are usually fighters. No more than 10% are higher than 2nd level; a group of ten or less has a single 1st.level fighter, the remainder are level 0. There is a 10% chance that any nomadic group has a single 1st- to 3rd-level thief or renegade wizard. Decisions are made by consensus.</div><div class='indent'>Nomads have few possessions. What they own is usually carried on their backs or hauled in crude wagons. There is a 50% chance that any given nomad is armed, usually with a club, a dagger, or – rarely – a short sword. Armor is used only 5% of the time, most commonly leather or padded. Though nomads seldom have anything for trade or sale, they can be good sources of information.</div><br/><div><h2 style=’color:#4169E1’>Rebel</h2><br/>Krynn rebels are small, mobile groups of fighters using guerilla tactics to further the causes of freedom. Rebel groups flourish wherever injustice and oppression prevail.</div><div class='indent'>Because secrecy is vital to a rebel band’s success, members do not wear uniforms or any other distinctive garb, although members of a rebel band may communicate with one another with secret signs or passwords. Since rebels are recruited from all walks of life, they share no common physical traits. However, rebels all tend to exhibit exceptional courage, idealism, and perseverance.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Since their lives depend on their fighting skills, rebels are superb combatants. Rebels with a year or more of guerilla experience gain a +1 bonus to their attack roll when using melee weapons.</div><div class='indent'>Rebel weaponry depends on whatever a group can scrounge. Roll 1d20 and consult the following table to determine a rebel’s primary weapon.<table<thead><tr><th>D20 Roll</th><th>Weapon</th><th>D20 Roll</th><th>Weapon</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1-5</td><td>Short sword</td><td>14-15</td><td>Long sword</td></tr><tr><td>6-7</td><td>Dagger</td><td>16</td><td>Blowgun</td></tr><tr><td>8-11</td><td>Crossbow</td><td>17-18</td><td>Mace</td></tr><tr><td>12-13</td><td>Sling</td><td>19-20</td><td>Battle axe</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br/><div>Armor is particularly hard to come by for rebels; 20% have shields, and an additional 30% have armor of the armored rebels, 40% have leather or padded armor, 40% have studded leather (or leather or padded armor with a shield), 10% have chain mail, and 10% have chain mail and a shield.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> Rebels have no permanent base of operations. If their identities are known by local officials, they seldom sleep in the same place twice, using caves, abandoned buildings, or the homes of sympathetic friends.</div><div class='indent'>Rebels try to keep their groups as small as possible rarely hav. ing more than 20 members. The group is split equally into 1st- to 4th-level fighters, 4th- to 6th-level fighters, and 7th-level or higher fighters. There is no more than a 5% chance that a rebel is fortunate enough to acquire a magical weapon. About 20% of the time, a large rebel group has a varying number of wizards, rogues, and priests; it is rare for more than 10% of a group to come from these classes.</div><div class='indent'>Rebels carry little or no money. Any treasure they acquire goes immediately to purchase weapons or medicines.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Master survivalists, rebels can live off the land for indefinite periods of time.</div>",

    "Description": "<div>The minotaurs of Krynn are a highly organized warrior race primarily occupying the remote islands of Mithas and Kothas. Huge and brutish, the minotaurs believe their destiny is to conquer and enslave the world.</div><div class='indent'>Most of Krynn’s minotaurs are informally known as Blood Sea minotaurs, named for the treacherous ocean area in which they are commonly encountered.</div><div class='indent'>The hulking minotaurs exceed 350 pounds in weight and seven feet in height. Short fur covers their massive bodies; a thin fuzz covers their faces and forearms. Their fur ranges from red-brown to near black. Their bullish faces are brutish and ugly, with broad snouts and wide-set eyes. Sharp, curving horns grow from their foreheads to a length of 6-12 inches for the females and one to two feet for the males. Minotaurs have long, wide hands with thick fingers ending in short claws.</div><div class='indent'>Minotaurs usually wear harnesses and skirts made of leather. The harnesses have loops and pockets to carry weapons, and are decorated with military awards and insignia. Some minotaurs wear rings of steel or other precious metals through their noses and ears.</div><div class='indent'>Minotaurs were an oppressed race for much of their early history. They spent many years as slaves of ogres, and another long period as slaves of mountain dwarves. They were enslaved by the Istar Empire until the onset of the Cataclysm, which the minotaurs saw as divine intervention on their behalf.</div><div class='indent'>After the Istar Empire sunk beneath the ocean the minotaurs sailed to the islands of Mithas and Kothas and claimed them for their own. With their new homes separated from the mainlands of Ansalon by the Blood Sea, the minotaurs believed they were at last in a position to become a world-class power.</div><div class='indent'>Minotaurs believe it is their destiny to bring the rest of Krynn under their control. They will go to any lengths to achieve domination. They believe that the weak should perish and that the strong should rule. Minotaur armies are legendary for their ruthlessness. Their laws are harsh and merciless.</div><div class='indent'>However, minotaurs are by no means mindless killers. Many are thoughtful and sophisticated. Some are even gentle. Though dedicated to their own goals, minotaurs will ally with the forces of good if convinced that it best serves their purposes.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Minotaurs are trained from youth for strength, cunning, and intelligence. Minotaurs are violent, brutal fighters, bent on slaughtering their opponents to the last man. Minotaurs view surrender as weakness, and unless they desire slaves or need prisoners for negotiating purposes, opponents who surrender are usually executed on the spot.</div><div class='indent'>The minotaurs’ favorite weapons are double-edged axes (dmg 1d10), but they also use flails (+2 damage bonus when used by a minotaur), daggers, and whips. Especially strong minotaurs (those with Strengths of 10 or higher) have been known to use a broad sword in each hand. Armor is leather and use of shields is rare.</div><div class='indent'>Minotaurs can also butt an opponent who is at least six feet tall to inflict 2d4 points of damage. They can bite opponents shorter than six feet to inflict 1d4 points of damage. Minotaurs have excellent senses and can track prey by scent with 50% accuracy when following a trail that is one day old or less. For each day after the trail was made, this chance is reduced by 10%.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> The fundamental principle of minotaur society is that might makes right. The minotaurs are lead by an emperor who resides in the city of Nethosak on the island of Mithas. Under the emperor is a Supreme Circle of eight minotaurs. The Supreme Circle advises the emperor and handles the day-to-day administration of the government. These positions are decided in armed confrontation in the Circus, a combat arena where rivals for the same office fight to the death. Minotaurs claim to have the only truly classless society, since anyone is eligible to become emperor, providing he or she defeats the current emperor in Circus combat. Minotaur clerics worship Sargas, known as Sargonnas to the Solamnics.</div><div class='indent'>Families are the foundation of minotaur society, and the honor of one’s family is held supreme above all other considerations. Minotaurs make conscientious parents, supervising the training and education of their offspring from an early age. Female children are offered the same opportunities as males, though females are vastly outnumbered; because of a genetic quirk, three minotaur males are born for every female. When a child reaches the age of 15, he or she engages in non-lethal combat in the Circus, a contest that serves as the minotaur’s rite of passage into adult society. Government elders observe the performances of the young minotaurs, then evaluate their aptitude for various sciences and crafts based on a series of oral examinations. The young minotaurs are then assigned roles in their communities to according to their abilities.</div><div class='indent'>Each minotaur community maintains a sizeable number of slaves; most slaves are humans obtained from captured though a few elven, dwarven, and ogre slaves are also in evidence. Virtually all of a minotaur city’s manual labor is performed by slaves. Slave laborers are treated harshly, though not with the wanton cruelty common to draconian or ogre masters.</div><div class='indent'>Minotaur justice is equally harsh, with floggings and beatings common for most minor infractions such as theft, infidelity, and assault; for more serious crimes, such as murder, the offender is sentenced to death in the term of gladiatorial combat in their circus. Every month prisoners fight a series of battles in the circus with the winners earning the right to live until the next month’s contests. Personal disputes among minotaurs are also settled in the circus; minotaur law forbids the killing of one minotaur by another unless it takes place in the circus. Most minotaurs are strong and also workers; they are particularly fine seafarers. Minotaurs have developed shipbuilding a fine art. Their sturdy – though somewhat sluggish – vessels are a common sight on the waters of the Blood sea; some vessels carry cargo between Mithas and Kothas, others are used for fishing, and still others are commissioned as cargo vessels by human customers. Though minotaurs have no particular affection for humans, they willingly accept money from them.</div><div class='indent'>Piracy is also a common activity for the seafaring minotaurs. They use sleek, light longships plundered from other races for catching and overcoming their victims, since minotaur-made vessels lack the necessary speed and maneuverability.</div><div class='indent'>Advancement in the minotaur navy is dependent in part on the number of plundered ships claimed by a minotaur officer. To the eyes of an outsider, minotaur cities are crude are oppressive places. The streets are paved with dirt that always seems to have the consistency of mud; even in dry seasons the rutted lanes and filly alleys consist of a gooey mire. Most buildings are made of wood, crudely assembled and always unpainted. Wooden foundations are left to rot. When a building collapses, another is constructed in its place.</div><div class='indent'>Most buildings are small clanholds that house families of 3d6 members. Each clanhold has one central room used for eating and other daily activities. The central room contains a large water trough used for both bathing and cooking. Adults have private sleeping areas, separated from the central room by a hanging curtain.</div><div class='indent'>Every block of a minotaur city contains at least one tavern or inn where eating and drinking goes on at all hours of the day and night. Large central shopping districts are the liveliest areas of a city during the daylight hours. Numerous shipyards line the shores of seacoast cities. Most shipyards are manned by dozens of slaves overseen by minotaur masters.</div><div class='indent'>Minotaurs not fortunate enough to live in city dwell in small villages. Villages are haphazard collections of shabby huts centered around a few stone buildings. Some of the stone buildings are temples for the worship of evil gods. The largest stone building is the residence of the local chieftain, who is referred to by the commoners as “Lord”. The huts are the hovels in which the commoners live and work.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Minotaurs frequently battle with various races on the high seas. They have only one natural enemy, the kyrie, whom the minotaurs consider to be trespassers. Battles between these races have raged for centuries, with the minotaurs slowly gaining the upper hand.</div><div class='indent'>Minotaurs produce a variety of products, among the them smoked and canned fish, weapons and armor (particularly leathers armor and shields), wool and woven goods and fine silver jewelry. They are fairly active traders with their solidly constructed war ships in especially high demand. The most commons import is lumber which is always in demand for construction of minotaur ships and buildings. Minotaurs eat a variety of food but they have a special taste for fish, mutton, and raw rains. They also enjoy strong ales and beers.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Thoradorian Minotaurs</b><div><br/><div>Thoradorian minotaurs live isolated villages on the southwestern coasts of Mithas. Thoradorian Minotaurs are considered to be an inferior class of minotaur – lazier, clumsier, and less intelligent than their blood sea cousins. Since all of the Thoradorian overtures for acceptance have been rejected by the bleed sea minotaurs, the Thoradorian minotaurs have been tell to their own devices.</div><div class='indent'>Thoradorian minotaurs are seldom visited by traders or travelers, as they have little of value to trade. Their primary industry is ship building. Through their ships are notable for their size and seaworthiness, similar ships are available from the Blood sea minotaurs at much lower prices.</div><div class='indent'>Most Thoradorian buildings are crude stone structures or caves dug into the mountains. Owing to their love or labyrinths, many homes contain winding passages leading from one room to the next. Natural cavern labyrinths serve as Thoradorian versions of the circus.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Minotaur Class Limits</b></div><br/><div><table><thead><tr><th>Class</th><th>Max.

    "Description": "</div>The ogres of Krynn are bloodthirsty, savage brutes. They are feared and despised by all intelligent races.</div><div class='indent'>Krynn ogres physically resemble the ogres of other worlds. They are taller than most humanoids, with thick and solidly muscled bodies. They have large heads with blunt noses, pointed ears, and high foreheads. A bony ridge covers their beady eyes, which are colored dull gray or blood red. Long, greasy hair grows from their lice-ridden scalps, dangling over their shoulders in matted tangles. Their dry skin, whose color ranges from dark brown to orange-yellow, is crusted with scabs and filth, and often covered with hairy warts. Krynn ogres have rows of sharp brown teeth, caked with grime. Black claws grow from their fingers and toes. Females resemble the males, though they are shorter and less muscular.</div><div class='indent'>Krynn ogres wear the skins and furs of animals they have killed. These are made into loose smocks, long breech cloths, and heavy capes. These skins are not tanned or otherwise treated before they are made into clothing, making them stink like rotting meat. Ogres do not wear gloves or shoes of any kind – their thickly calloused soles provide protection and traction. Some wear stone necklaces, others paint their bodies with crude pigments.</div><div class='indent'>Few creatures are as violent and cruel as ogres. With their low intelligence and flaring tempers, murder, vandalism, and abuse are commonplace in their societies. Greedy and covetous, ogres love treasure almost as much as they do bloodshed.</div><div class='indent'>Krynn ogres speak their own language. Ogre chieftains and leaders usually speak common; 10% of tribesmen other than chieftains and leaders also speak common.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Like the ogres of other worlds, Krynn ogres are extremely dangerous. Not only is violence their common response to most problems, they are perfectly willing to fight to the death over the most trivial conflicts. An ogre is too dull-witted to utilize complex tactics: instead, it engages in brutal melee until either it or its opponent is dead. So intense is their violence that ogres must be restrained from pummeling their opponents long after they have been killed. Strangers are attacked mercilessly, including members of other ogre tribes. An ogre often would rather beat a stranger into submission than waste time speaking with him.</div><div class='indent'>Ogres use spears, battle axes, maces, clubs, and similar melee weapons. These are either stolen from dead victims, or assembled from stone, wood, and other common materials. Though crudely made, ogre weapons are just as effective as their more carefully crafted counterparts. Ogres seldom use bows, slings, or other missile weapons; not only do they find them clumsy to use, they deny the ogres the physical satisfaction of beating and chopping their victims.</div><div class='indent'>Ogres rarely wear armor, mainly because it is difficult to locate armor pieces large enough to fit them. Large ogres sometimes wear thick layers of furs and skins imbedded with chips of stone to give them an effective AC of 4.</div><div class='indent'>Ogre leaders and chieftains are stronger than their followers and inflict significantly more damage. A leader is AC 3, has at least 30 hit points, attacks as a 7-HD creature, and gains an additional +1 damage bonus to his weapon attacks. A chieftain is AC 4, has at least 34 hit points, attacks as a 7-HD creature, and has an additional +2 damage bonus to his weapon attacks.</div><div class='indent'>Immature ogres – those between the ages of 5-20 years – have no more than 3 hit points per Hit Die. They attack with their fists to inflict 1d4 points of damage. They can use simple weapons, such as clubs and axes, with a -3 penalty to inflicted damage.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> Legend has it that the ogres were the first race to awaken on Krynn. The original ogres were graceful and attractive creatures, though they had an inclination toward evil. Their tribes flourished in all corners of the world. An early ogre clan leader named Igrane tried to convince the other tribes that if they failed to renounce their evil natures, they would be doomed to a future of conflict and destruction. The ogres rejected this prediction. Igrane abandoned them to their folly, taking with him a band of enlightened followers who came to be known as the Irda (see the Ogre, High entry for details).</div><div class='indent'>Igrane’s prediction, of course, came true. The rise of competing races brought about the end of the ogres’ domination of Krynn. They were hunted and slaughtered by the elves and dwarves, driven into exile by the humans, and betrayed and enslaved by the minotaurs. Additionally, the various ogre tribes warred constantly with each other, reducing their numbers even further. In the end, the ogres were forced into the most remote reaches of Krynn, where they remain to this day. The good races avoid them, while the evil races see them as just another exploitable resource.</div><div class='indent'>Ogre tribes make their homes in the grimmest of lands, where the grass is withered and brown, the earth is cracked and dusty, and the waters are foul and stagnant. Though ogre cities exist, most ogres live in small settlements. A typical ogre settlement is a collection of crude stone huts centered around a large water hole. Each hut is the home of three or four ogres. The tribal leader and chieftain (assuming the tribe is large enough to have both) live in private huts. A hut has no furnishings aside from old furs used for sleeping and the family’s weapon collection. Outside of each hut are large racks supporting strips of meat that are drying over smokeless charcoal fires. A typical village also includes a treasure hut and a games pit that holds several wolves, bears, or snakes; ogres enjoy dumping weaker tribesmen into the pit, then watching them try to scramble out.</div><div class='indent'>An ogre family consists of a mated pair and one or two children. Females give birth to a single child once per year. When ogres reach the age of 20, they move into their own huts to start their own families, though they still remain with the tribe. Elderly ogres – those too old to hunt, bear children, or serve the tribe in any other way – are slain.</div><div class='indent'>A tribe of ten or more members has one leader. In tribes of 20 or more, there is also a chieftain; in these cases, the leader serves as the chieftain’s deputy. No more than half of the tribe are females. Ogres view females as inferior in all respects, useful only for menial jobs and for bearing children. The chieftain (or leader, in the case of smaller tribes) keeps careful track of the number of females in the tribe. If the number of female children exceeds the number of male children, the excess female children are killed.</div><div class='indent'>Each tribe also keeps a number of slaves, equal to about 20% of the tribal population. Most of the slaves are human, but a few are elves or dwarves. Ogre tribes are constantly in need of new slaves, since tribesmen kill them for sport and eat them when they are too lazy to hunt.</div><div class='indent'>An ogre hunting party usually consists of a leader and about six adult males, all heavily armed. A hunting trip lasts anywhere from a few days to several weeks, depending on the needs of the tribe and the scarcity of game. The leader treats his followers cruelly, for instance, using the weakest one as bait to lure hungry game. Followers sometimes arrange for the unfortunate demise of the leader on hunting trips. On their return, they report the loss of the leader to the tribe, then one of their number claims the leader’s position.</div><div class='indent'>Ogre leaders and chieftains are absolute rulers of their tribes. Crimes against the tribe include betrayal, theft, unjustified murder, and cowardice. Punishment for all such crimes is death, usually a lingering and painful one. Criminals might be hung upside down on a cliff to be roasted alive in the sun’s rays, sealed in a bag with poisonous snakes and thrown into the sea to drown, or sunk in a quicksand bog while the tribe watches and cheers.</div><div class='indent'>Ogres are required to bring all treasure taken from defeated victims back to their village. The chieftain (or leader in smaller tribes) claims half for himself. The ogres who retrieved the treasure are given a small share, usually no more than 10%, and the rest is placed in the treasure hut. The chieftain (or leader) awards treasure to tribesmen for special achievements, such as defeating powerful enemies; invariably, the chieftain presents most of these special awards to himself.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> All intelligent races go out of their way to avoid ogres. However, evil races occasionally employ ogres in their armies. The ogres are too stupid and undependable for complicated missions, but they willingly accept all manner of dangerous and distasteful tasks if the price is right. Some minotaur communities keep ogres as slaves.</div><div class='indent'>Ogres hunt wolverines, wolves, and other woodland creatures for food, but they are also fond of human, elven, and dwarven flesh; kender and gnome meat is considered a delicacy. Ogre fishermen scavenge the shorelines for dead fish, since this is easier than catching them, and dead ones are just as tasty as live ones.</div><div class='indent'>No other races trade with ogres, but ogre tribes occasionally trade with each other. Such transactions often erupt in violence. One tribe, for instance, might trade animal skins and ale for a second tribe’s gems and weapons. When the second tribe becomes drunk from the strong ale, the first tribe slits their throats and takes what they want.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Orughi</b><div><br/><div>The orughi are an ogre race dwelling on remote islands north of Ansalon. They are shorter, tatter, and duller than most ogres, but they are no less aggressive. They have stringy golden hair, oily gray skin, and webbed hands and feet, enabling them to swim at twice their land movement rate.</div><div class='indent'>Though good fighters, the orughi are not as strong as other ogres and are more prone to panic. When possible, orughi try to lure their opponents into the sea; because of their swimming skill and the fact that they can hold their breath for 20 rounds, they are dangerous opponents in the water. Orughi use battle axes and daggers and also carry special weapons called tonkks. These weapons, resembling iron boomerangs connected to long metallic cords, are used by the orughi to capture birds. The tonkks inflict no damage but can be used to ensnare victims up to a distance of 30 yards (they cannot be used in the water)</div><div class='indent'>Because of their skill with these weapons, orughi attacks with tonkks are made with a +3 bonus to the attack roll (non-orughi use tonkks with a -2 penalty). The cord of the tonkk rapidly wraps itself around a successfully attacked victim; once per round, the victim can attempt a Dexterity check with a -2 penalty. If he succeeds, he has untangled himself. If he fails, he must roll a Strength check with a -4 penalty. If the Strength check falls, the victim is pulled ten yards closer to the orughi who entangled him.</div><div class='indent'>Orughi live in crude wooden shacks on the shores of their islands; they spend most of their time hunting and flshing. They worship Zeboim, the evil Queen of the Sea, and build elaborate shrines in her honor near the water’s edge. These shrines, resembling cylindrical towers of stone, can be seen from miles away; experienced sailors recognize them as a sign of an orughi settlement.</div><div class='indent'>The orughi have no formal government. The eldest males of each family collectively rule the tribe. Disagreements are settled by combat. Orughi collect less treasure than other ogres. Their treasure caches seldom contain magical items, but usually include an ample supply of pearls and other gems recovered from the ocean floor.</div>",

    "Description": "<div>High ogres, also known as Irda, are a handsome and gentle race of ogres inhabiting an idyllic island located far from the civilized lands of Ansalon.</div><div class='indent'>Irda are tall, slender creatures, averaging six feet in height and weighing about 150 pounds. Females tend to be as tall and as heavy as the males. Although slender, they are quite strong, as evidenced by their firm muscles. Their skin tones range from midnight blue to a deep sea green. Their hair is usually black, but it can also be silver or white. Irda always wear their hair short and keep it carefully combed. Their drawn faces and drooping eyelids give the false impression that they are bored or uncaring. Their eyes are silver. They are long-lived, commonly reaching the age of 500 ycars.</div><div class='indent'>Irda wear simple, Lightweight clothing, such as linen smocks or silken gowns, in shades of beige, light blue, and other pastel colors. They refuse to wear wool, leather, or any other material derived from animals. Their wardrobes are occasionally enhanced by a modest piece of jewelry, such as an emerald pin, a pearl ring, or a thin steel necklace.</div><div class='indent'>Irda move with a fluid motion so graceful that it is a joy to watch. Their voices are extraordinary – rich, melodic tones that are among the most beautiful sounds heard on Krynn.</div><div class='indent'>Irda have innate shapechanging abilities and can disguise their size and true form in many ways. They can change their height by as much as two feet in either direction, and can duplicate the features of any humanoid race: they are especially convincing as elves, half-elves, and humans. The Irda’s shapechanging ability requires several years of practice to perfect. Usually, an Irda masters shapechanging into a particular form, then uses that form over and over.</div><div class='indent'>The Irda are a peaceful people who mean no harm to the rest of the world. They are gentle, soft-spoken, and thoughtful, repulsed by the violence that periodically rocks the nations of Krynn.</div><div class='indent'>Though they bear no animosity toward other races, Irda have never been fully accepted in any other culture, thanks in large part to the superstitions developed about them over the years. Tales are told of the terrible, ancient ogres who would return one day to bring death and destruction. Since the Irda are descended from the original ogres, many assume that they are the rumored harbingers of doom. When an Irda’s true race is revealed, invariably it is hunted down and killed by a superstitious populace.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Irda have no natural aptitude for fighting, and combat skills are uncommon among them. Given the option, lrda would rather gracefully retreat than engage in a bloody melee. They see nothing noble about combat; in fact, following a physical engagement with an enemy, Irda undergo a cleansing ceremony to rid themselves of the spiritual corruption inherent in any violent confrontation.Thanks to their ogre heritage and superior strength, Irda are capable of inflicting 1d10 points of damage with a typical veapon attack. However, because of their aversion to physical contact, they are poor melee combatants; when Irda attempt to use any melee weapon, including swords, maces, daggers, and staffs, they do so with a -1 penalty to the attack roll. For that reason, Irda are more likely to use bows, slings, or other missile weapons.</div><div class='indent'>The Irda’s preferred weapons are those of their own design, such as vine bolas (four-foot-long vines weighted on both ends with hook-shaped stones that entangle a victim up to 25 yards distant and inflict 1d4 points of damage; an entangled victim can free himself if he succeeds in a Dexterity check with a -2 penalty) and cluster balls (balls of dried clay imbedded with sharp thorns containing a mild poison; these cause 1-2 points of damage and an additional 1d4 points of poison damage if the victim fails a saving throw vs. poison).</div><div class='indent'>Irda also create powder bombs from hollowed-out eggs containing various mixtures of herbs and natural poisons. A burst powder bomb affects all those within a ten-foot radius. The various types include sleep powder bombs (victims must roll successful saving throws vs. poison or receive the effects of a sleep spell), paralysis powder bombs (victims must roll successful saving throws vs. paralyzation or be paralyzed for 2d4 rounds), and blindness powder bombs (victims must roll successful saving throws vs. poison or receive the effects of a blindness spell for 2d4 rounds).</div><div class='indent'>Those Irda capable of using magic employ spells instead of weapons whenever possible. Since magic-using Irda have a clearer understanding of the workings of magic than most other races, Irda clerics and wizards gain one additional spell of the highest level they can use. Irda who are Changer Adepts or Changer Savants (see below) use their superior shapechanging skills to frighten their opponents (by changing into a minotaur or death knight) or to escape from them (by changing into a mouse or a bird).</div><div class='indent'>Irda feel awkward in armor and wear it only in the most extreme circumstances. They prefer the lightest armor, such as padded armor, and, of course, refuse to wear leather armor or any other protective clothing made from animals.</div><div class='indent'>The Irda’s relatively low Constitution makes them more vulnerable to the effects of poison than most other races. Whenever Irda must save vs. poison, they do so with a -1 penalty.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> The Irdanaiath, an ancient text held sacred by the Irda but unknown among the other races of Ansalon, explains the origin of the high ogres. Though it is commonly believed that elves were the first race to awaken in the Age of Dreams, the Irdanaiath suggests that the ogres were the first. In the dawn of the world, the ogres were the fairest of all the races. Their dark grace and savage beauty were unsurpassed, yet their hearts were cold and bent toward evil.</div><div class='indent'>When ogres walked the world as its dominant race, they had occasion to interact with humans. In their dealings, the humans unwittingly gifted a great and powerful ogre clan leader named Igrane with free will. Igrane began to look upon the world with new eyes.</div><div class='indent'>The gift of free will spread among Igrane’s clansmen, who came to be called the Irda, until they all saw the debasement that would inevitably result from their evil ways. They tried to convince other ogre clans of their folly, but their pleas were curtly dismissed. Civil wars erupted among the ogres, wars fought in places hidden from the eyes of men.</div><div class='indent'>In time, the Irda removed themselves from contact with the rest of the world. They found haven on an island they named Anaiatha. This refuge was located in the northern oceans of Ansalon, far from all other civilized areas. Here the Irda could live undisturbed. The ogres who did not foresee their debasement eventually fulfilled Igrane’s prediction, becoming uglier and more misshapen until their appearance matched the evil in their hearts.</div><div class='indent'>The onset of the Cataclysm upset the Irda’s life of pastoral bliss on Anaiatha. The forces of evil, whose power had blossomed in the wake of the Cataclysm, discovered the Irda’s island and attacked. Though the evil forces were eventually repelled, many Irda were captured and taken to Ansalon.</div><div class='indent'>When the forces of evil were eventually defeated in the War of the Lance, the surviving captive Irda were freed. These Irda still wander the lands of Ansalon in disguise, desperately trying to find a way back to their homeland of Anaiatha. The Irda are usually alone, but occasionally small groups of 1d10 Irda are discovered roaming the countryside. Families may be encountered; the parents’ fondest wish is to find a way to their island home, if not for themselves, then for the sake of their children.</div><div class='indent'>A variety of magical powers protect Anaiatha from discovery, including a permanent hallucinatory terrain spell that makes the island appear to be a calm stretch of ocean. However, wandering Irda can hear the telepathic call of their homeland during the High Sanction (full moon) of Solinari, the most distant of Krynn’s three moons. During these times, which last for a period of nine days once every 36 days, the Irda can find their way across the ocean to Anaiatha, assuming they have a ship or other means to make the journey. Unfortunately, the journey lasts far longer than the duration of High Sanction, and few lost Irda are ever able to return to Anaiatha on their own.</div><div class='indent'>Anaiatha is a tropical paradise, filled with lush vegetation and friendly animals. The Irda have no permanent dwellings, making their homes in caves and valleys, and relocating as the spirit moves them. They acquire few possessions, although they are fascinated by the beauty of gems and jewelry. Most have accumulated small caches of coins and other treasure, to be used if necessary to bribe or otherwise buy off unwelcome intruders.</div><div class='indent'>The Irda are governed by a king who rules as the absolute monarch. All Irda kings can trace their lineage to lgrane. A king rules until the age of 400, at which time one of the king’s progeny succeeds to the throne. A king can be either male or female and is usually the oldest of the former king’s children.</div><div class='indent'>Irda give birth to 1d4 children every 50 years. Irda are conscientious parents, beginning instruction in all of the arts and sciences within the first few weeks of a child’s life. Of all their lessons, the most important is the art of shapechanging. With diligent practice, most Irda have mastered basic shapechanging by the age of 20, enabing them to disguise themselves as humanoids at will. An Irda with an Intelligence of at least 16 can study to become a Changer Adept once it reaches the age of 50. Learning to be a Changer Adept takes at least ten years of study, but once mastered, a Changer Adept can shapechange, as per the 9th-level wizard spell, up to three times each day An Irda with an Intelligence of at least 18 can then study to become a Changer Savant when he reaches the age of 100. This requires at least 50 years of practice. A Changer Savant can shapechange at will.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Irda strive to live in perfect harmony with nature. An Irda will not intentionally harm a living creature unless his own life is at risk. For these reasons, Irda do not wear or use leather, wool, or any other products from animals. They are strict vegetarians, enjoying all varieties of fruits, grains, and vegetables. Not only do they avoid meat, they also refuse to eat eggs or drink milk. Irda have no taste for alcoholic beverages of any kind.</div><div class='indent'>Irda do not engage in trade, nor do they create products of any value to other races. Outsiders occasionally seek them out for information about exotic plants or animals. Irda usually trade such information in exchange for the safe return of a lost friend or relative still wandering the lands of Ansalon.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>High Ogre Class/Level Limits</b></div><br/><div><table><thead><tr><th>Class</th><th>Max.

    "Description": "<div>In their normal state, phaethons look just like very thin, short half-elves. Their hair color varies, though bright, coppery red is common. Their skin tends to be ruddy and weathered. All phaethons, however, have dark, brown eyes.</div><div class='indent'>The clothing of phaethons is sample and rustic. They commonly wear a plain, waist-length tunic with baggy trousers which are gathered at the ankles. Sandals are worn in summer, replaced by soft boots in colder weather The only really colorful articles of clothing are a brightly colored and embroidered sash which is wound around the waist, and warm, wool caps, which are woven in intricate patterns.</div><div class='indent'>The thing that sets phaethons apart is their ability to instantly sprout a set of magnificent, flaming wings, simply by willing them into existence. With these wings they can soar across their native mountains with the grace of an eagle and the splendor of a phoenix.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Phaethons are tirelessly vigilant in their home regions and very difficult to catch unawares; all phaethons gain a +1 bonus to their own surprise rolls.</div><div class='indent'>Phaethons are usually armed with a knife and a quarterstaff. If they are expecting trouble, they may bring along spears and bows as well. Leather armor is worn when they leave their settlements, giving them AC 8.</div><div class='indent'>In a one-on-one fight, a phaethon uses its knife and quarterstaff if it has a good chance to win (i.e., if it’s fighting something with only 1 or 2 Hit Dice). Against an opponent with 3 or more Hit Dice, the phaethon ignites its wings and uses them to batter the opponent. The combination of clubbing and burning causes 3d6 points of damage.</div><div class='indent'>Alternatively, the phaethon can try to wrestle with its opponent. A successful attack causes normal wrestling damage (2 points for a phaethon) plus 1d6 points of flame damage. If, however the phaethon achieves a hold that can be maintained from round to round, it automatically inflicts 3d6 points of damage each round, as long as the hold is maintained (opponent can roll a Strength check, with a -2 penalty, every round to break free).</div><div class='indent'>Besides making the phaethon more lethal, the heat and light from the wings improve its AC to 3. Also, while its wings are aflame, it receives a +3 bonus to all saving throws vs. flame or heat attacks of any sort.</div><div class='indent'>Phaethons never attack anyone without a good reason. Strangers nearing the phaethons’ territory arc watched carefully from the first time they are sighted to determine their intentions. If the strangers behave well and treat the mountains with respect, the phaethons do not molest them unless the phaethons are directly threatened. If the strangers are destructive and disruptive, the phaethons still consider the situation carefully before launching any attack. Even if the characters are obviously evil, the phaethons let them pass if they seem destined for some other place. Only if the intruders seem bent on seeking out the phaethons’ home and attacking it or are causing needless destruction in the area do the phaethons consider attacking.</div><div class='indent'>If the phaethons do consider an attack, they will first try to interrogate one of the intruders. A handful of experienced fighters (or one or two elders, if available) sneak into the intruders’ camp at an opportune moment and kidnap one of the intruders. This captive is quickly spirited away to a safe location away from the phaethons’ homes and made to drink a truth draught concocted of locally grown herbs and fermented roots (the formula for this truth draught is known to only a few of the most prestigious phaethons). After drinking the truth draught, the prisoner is questioned regarding the group’s origin, destination, and mission. If the answers to these questions are satisfactory, the prisoner is led back to an area very near his companions and released when the truth draught wears off, he remembers nothing.</div><div class='indent'>If, on the other hand, the prisoner’s answers indicate that the group presents a danger to the phaethons, the prisoner is executed (mercifully) and an ambush prepared for the rest of the group.</div><div class='indent'>Once the decision to attack is made, the phaethons are ruthless and merciless foes. If the phaethons believe that their opponents will carry along wounded comrades rather than abandon them to their fate, the phaethons aim their attacks to wound and incapacitate rather than kill. This burdens the enemy with wounded sodiers, slows them down, and lowers their morale. If the enemy abandons its wounded soldiers, then the phaethons fight only to kill.</div><div class='indent'>In either case, their standard tactic is hit and run. Phaethons hide in rocks and ledges overlooking an area where they expect the enemy to pass. When most of the enemy group has gone by, the phaethons ignite their wings and swoop down on the tail of the column, fighting until each attacker has killed or incapacitated one enemy, and then fly away to safety. The attacking group always leaves one-third of its members posted on the overlooking rocks as a reserve in case a retreat becomes necessary, the phaethons who attacked (and are presumably tired and wounded) flee while the reserve delays pursuers.</div><div class='indent'>It the phaethons believe that they have enough of an edge over their opponents, they may abandon the hit-and-run attack and launch an all-out assault. Even in this case, however, they still leave a reserve in case something goes wrong. If the attack is going well, the reserve may also be ordered to join in the attack and help finish the job.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> Phaethon society is essentially the same as all other demihuman societies. The basic group is the family, which consists of an adult male, adult female, and a variable number of offspring. The typical family has one to three children.</div><div class='indent'>Phaethons have a predominantly agricultural society. Their farms are built on the steep, terraced slopes of the mountainsides surrounding their homes. They raise grams, fruits, and vegetables, herd sheep and goats, and keep rabbits and chickens. Phaethons work hard and take tremendous pride in their farms and buildings. Their settlements, which consist of a dozen or so family buildings and plots surrounding a central village square, are always well ordered and immaculately clean.</div><div class='indent'>To a phaethon, honesty and truthfulness are more important than any other quality. Lying for any reason is considered a more grievous crime than stealing. But crime of any sort is almost unknown among phaethons. Their devotion to lawfulness and honesty is so strong that many of them have a hard time understanding the concept of willfully committing a crime.</div><div class='indent'>This devotion to honesty extends beyond the spoken word and respect for property. To phaethons, actions really do speak much more loudly than words. A man who lights a fire and then lets it go out through neglect is considered foolish. A man who chops down a tree and then lets it lie is considered a complete loss.</div><div class='indent'>These attitudes cause a deal of friction when phaethons deal with other demihuman races. They are always willing to judge individuals on their own merits rather than the faults or strengths of others but telling even the slightest untruth for any reason permanently blemishes that person’s reputation.</div><div class='indent'>Characters who are sent into the mountains to deal with the phaethons for any reason whatever must be prepared to be scrupulously honest at all times and about all things.</div><div class='indent'>To avoid problems, phaethons customarily do not question each other or outsiders about their personal lives unless they are from the same family. The desire to give an honest answer often conflicts with the need for privacy or the need to not insult friends. Therefore, phaethons do not ask leading questions without first preparing themselves for the worst. For a stranger or an outsider to ask such questions is considered rude at best and a personal challenge at worst.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Phaethons want nothing more than to live lives of quiet contentment amidst their beloved mountains. They produce no items for trade because they are completely self-sufficient and have no need for imported goods. When the affairs of the outside world impose on the phaethons culture, however, they are ruthless and uncompromising in protecting their land.</div><div class='indent'>Young phaethons learn to fly in the same way they learn to walk; by trial and error. This ability usually develops by the age of five or six.</div><div class='indent'>Phaethons do not spend a great deal of time flying; it is a luxury to them, something to be done when work is finished. Still, on calm summer evenings, groups of them can be seen soaring above the peaks and swooping through the valleys.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Elder Phaethon</b></div><br/><div>The life expectancy of most phaethons is 90 to 100 years. For a reason not even the phaethons understand, some do not die of old age; instead, sometime around their 90th year, they are overcome by a desire to fly toward the sun. They climb, and climb, and climb ever higher until either exhaustion or lack of oxygen or both causes them to pass out. As they plunge back toward Krynn, a marvelous transformation takes place and as they regain their senses, still thousands of feet above ground, they discover that they have metamorphosed into elder phaethons.</div><div class='indent'>Elder phaethons are taller than phaethons, with snow white hair, black pupils, and copper-colored skin. Their flaming wings are brilliant and at least 30 feet from wing tip to wing tip. They can, quite literally, dance in the air.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Elder phaethons use much the same tactics in combat as normal phaethons, but they are solitary. They rely more on their speed and agility in the air to strike their enemies with multiple passes. They display the same ruthless cunning as normal phaethons.</div><div class='indent'>One or two elder phaethons are often found accompanying groups of normal phaethons that are flying to intercept intruders. The presence of the elder phaethon raises the morale of the normal phaethons by 2.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> Elder phaethons are solitary. They still know their family and friends, but they have no need or desire to return to them or to their farms. They spend their days soaring through the mountains, scouting for intruders, lost travelers, and anything else that is out of place or unusual. They are invaluable guardians for the phaethon settlements in that little happens in the mountains without their knowledge.</div><div class='indent'>Most of an elder phaethon’s time is spent either in flight or sitting atop a mountain and scanning the world around. A panoramic vista and air beneath their wings seem to be their only concerns.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Elder phaethons neither hunt nor gather. Their food requirements are very slight and are met entirely by the inhabitants of the phaethon settlements under their guardianship. The people of these settlements leave food out in the open and, approximately once a week, an elder phaethon stops by to pick up the food and relay any pertinent messages. These visits are always brief and formal.</div><div class='indent'>Elder phaethons have been known to look after villages of humans and demihumans as well as those of normal phaethons, if the humans and demihumans have demonstrated that they are worthy of protection. If the village ever neglects to leave food for the elder phaethon or lies to him in any way, he will forsake that village forever.</div><div class='indent'>However, if a village is under his wing, so to speak, he will defend it with his own life, if necessary.</div><div class='indent'>In the absence of violence, an elder phaethon can live another 150 to 200 years.</div>",

    "Description": "<div>The shadowpeople are a race of mammals that lives underground in small self-contained communities. One of the oldest races of Krynn, they are little known to the outside world.</div><div class='indent'>Shadowpeople resemble slim, gangly apes. They have hairy heads with small flat noses, pointed ears, and sharp fangs, two of which protrude above their lower lips when their mouths are closed. Their eyes are green or amber and resemble those of a cat. They have long claws on their hands and feet. Smooth fur, either black or dark brown, covers their bodies. A long, stretchable membrane connects their arms to their flanks. The membrane enables them to glide through the air, covering ten feet of ground for every foot they drop (for instance, a shadowperson dropping from a ten-foot ledge could glide 100’).</div><div class='indent'>When in their subterranean homes, shadowpeople wear few clothes. Their fur provides sufficient warmth, and they have no interest in body decoration. On their rare trips to the surface, they are likely to wear long, dark robes and hoods to conceal their identities.</div><div class='indent'>To the surface-dwelling races of Krynn, shadowpeople are commonly regarded as creatures of myth. Cherishing their privacy, the shadowpeople have gone to great lengths to preserve their reputation as nonexistent creatures, seldom interacting with other races and maintaining their communities far from other civilized outposts. Shadowpeople are, in tact, a kind and benevolent race, capable in drastic situations of uniting with good citizens of other races to promote their common interests.</div><div class='indent'>Shadowpeople can communicate in a series of squeaks and growls that forms a primitive language, but they are much more likely to use their advanced mental abilities to send and receive messages. All shadowpeople can send and receive thoughts telepathically to creatures within a 60-foot range, assuming the sender and receiver share a common language and that they are not separated by more than three feet of stone, three inches of iron, or any solid sheeting of lead, gold, or steel. Additionally, shadowpeople can use ESP at will, as per the 2nd-level wizard spell, up to a range of 50 yards.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> The two classes of shadowpeople are warriors and counselors. The counselors are unskilled in combat; they depend on the warriors for protection. Shadow warriors are skilled and able fighters, striking quickly and silently. Each shadow warrior employs a wickedly curved hook called a shadowstaff to both attack and restrain opponents. Once an opponent has been impaled on the hook of a shadowstaff, the opponent’s attacks are hampered and he continues to take damage from the hook. The victim suffers a -2 penalty on all attack rolls and sustains an additional 1d8 points of damage every round until one or the other of the combatants is dead or until the fight ends. An impaled victim is also unable to cast spells. The construction of a shadowstaff is such that is very difficult for a victim to pull himself free once he is impaled; if he takes no other actions and succeeds in Dexterity checks for two successive rounds with a -2 penalty, he has freed himself from the shadowstatf.</div><div class='indent'>The ESP ability of the shadowpeople accounts for their low Armor Class. In combat, they are able to anticipate the actions of their enemies and can take the appropriate measures to defend themselves. Shadowpeople cannot be surprised by any sentient creature within 60’.</div><div class='indent'>The shadowpeople’s most important defense is the mindweave, a ritual undertaken by shadow warriors prior to venturing into situations of potential danger. The mindweave ritual lasts about one hour, during which time the participants link hands to form a large circle, then chant in unison and concentrate. During the mindweave, the shadowpeople use their telepathic abilities to tie all of their minds together. For 1d4+4 hours after the ritual, the shadowpeople share a collective awareness that enables them to move, fight, and defend in perfect unison, giving them a +1 bonus to all attack rolls and saving throws. Characters of other races invited to participate in the mindweave can also receive the benefits of the ritual if they succeed in an Intelligence check with a -5 penalty.</div><div class='indent'>Though good fighters in darkness, shadowpeople are severely handicapped when fighting in the light of the sun. When the sky is overcast, they can execute normal actions, but do so at great pain, causing a -2 penalty to all attack rolls. In bright sunlight, this penalty increases to -4. Shadowpeople exposed to bright sunlight become temporarily blinded after 2d6 turns of exposure. The blindness lasts for a number of hours equal to the number of turns spent outside.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> Shadowpeople are most commonly found in catacombs beneath large cities, or in dungeons and underground reaches of vast, abandoned cities in the more desolate regions of the world. One of the largest communities of shadowpeople is located beneath the dark city of Sanction, a port in central Ansalon on the northeastern shore of the New Sea. Surrounded by three great volcanos, Sanction is an unappealing jumble of warehouses, brothels, slum dwellings, and slave markets. During the War of the Lance, Sanction was a major stronghold of the forces of evil; unknown to them, a tunnel system honeycombing the land below the city provided a hiding place for a thriving community of shadowpeople.</div><div class='indent'>In Sanction, as in other populated areas near shadowpeople communities, the existence of the race is the subject of rumors and speculation. From time to time, a solitary explorer or an inquisitive wizard may stumble on a community of shadowpeople, but such intruders are usually sworn to secrecy or given potions to erase their memories. So far, no one has revealed the existence of the shadowpeople to the world at large – at least, no such stories have yet been believed. Still, shadowpeople are occasionally seen at night by children or the elderly; shadowpeople have a special affinity for human children and senior citizens, and sometimes engage in pleasant mental conversations with them at their bedsides.</div><div class='indent'>Shadowpeople have a close, clannish culture. Mated shadowpeople have 1d4 offspring at a time, and the young are cared for by whatever adults happen to be nearby. When young shadowpeople reach the age of ten, they are assigned to either the warrior class or to the counselor class. These assignments are not arbitrary; they are made on the basis of the youngsters’ aptitudes and interests.</div><div class='indent'>The warriors patrol the underground tunnel network and defend the clan against intrusion. The counselors make all of the administrative decisions for the clan. One of the counselors is elected to serve as king. The king makes the final decisions in instances where the counselors are unable to reach a consensus. The counselors also participate in a mindweave ritual similar to that of the warriors to create the Revered Ancient One (see following).</div><div class='indent'>A typical settlement of shadowpeople is a labyrinth of subterranean passages linking variouslysized natural caverns. Passages leading to the main living areas are lined with traps. Intruders stepping in the wrong place trigger two immense slabs of stone to drop from the ceiling, completely blocking the passage. Trapped intruders are telepathically examined by shadow warriors to determine their motives. Intruders are required to agree to the terms of the shadow warriors, or are left trapped between the slabs.</div><div class='indent'>Personal residences are furnished simply, with stone furniture and woven mats for sleeping. Each residence has three vents; one vent leads to the surface to bring in fresh air, the second leads to an underground stream to provide fresh water, and the third leads to a bottomless passage or a lava stream for refuse disposal. Other caverns are used for mushroom farms, conference rooms, and recreational areas. The deepest and most inaccessible cavern is reserved for the Revered Ancient One.</div><div class='indent'>Shadowpeople do not collect treasure, but are fascinated by art. Most cavern walls are decorated with elaborate drawings depicting scenes and heroes from the shadowpeople’s past. Shadow warriors sometimes venture to the surface world to make oft with an especially attractive sculpture or painting.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Shadowpeople have no natural enemies, save for the jarak-sinn, a race of savage lizard men who occasionally raid shadowpeople settlements in an attempt to drive them from their homes. Shadowpeople do not keep any domesticated animals.</div><div class='indent'>Mushrooms and other fungi are dietary staples, supplemented at times by insects and worms. Shadowpeople do not engage in trade.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Revered Ancient One</b></div><br/><div>The Revered Ancient One is the manifestation of the mental energies of the shadowpeople counselors. When the counselors link hands to form a large circle, then chant in unison and concentrate for an hour, the Revered Ancient One appears. The amount of time the Revered Ancient One remains conjured depends on the number of counselors performing the mindweave ritual. If four to ten counselors perform the ritual, the Revered Ancient One appears for 1-2 hours. If 11 or more counselors perform the ritual, the Revered Ancient One appears for 2d4 hours. Fewer than four counselors cannot conjure the Revered Ancient One. Characters of other races can participate in the mindweave ritual, but they do not count as counselors when determining whether the Revered Ancient One is conjured or how long it stays.</div><div class='indent'>The Revered Ancient One has no physical properties or attributes. Its intelligence is always genius level, and it is always of neutral good alignment. The Revered Ancient One can cast <i>cure serious wounds</i> an unlimited number of times per day, providing the recipient of the spell is brought to the Revered Ancient One’s cavern (see below). The Revered Ancient One can also cast teleport without error on anyone brought to its cavern; the recipient can be teleported to any location in the Prime Material plane, providing he has been there before. Finally, the Revered Ancient One can answer any question mentally posed by any of the counselors who conjured it The Revered Ancient One answers these questions with 95% accuracy: however, the Revered Ancient One has no ability to foresee future events.</div><div class='indent'>The Revered Ancient One usually resides in a sacred cavern adjacent to the shadowpeople’s community. This cavern is always blocked by a permanent wall of force that the Revered Ancient One can negate at will, enabling it to decide who will pass through. No light of any kind exists in the Revered Ancient Ones cavern, even when it is not present: the darkness cannot be dispelled by magical or any other means. The Revered Ancient One communicates mentally, a character perceives its words as a soothing voice, distant and echoed.</div>",

    "Description": "<div>Shimmerweed is a most unusual, and beautiful, variety of plant that is found in temperate regions throughout the world. Although it is wholly inoffensive and has few natural enemies, shimmerweed can be one of the most dangerous things a party encounters as it strolls through the wilds of Krynn.</div><div class='indent'>Shimmerweed is a type of wildflower that grows in small patches. Although on first inspection it looks much like a dandelion gone to seed, a closer look reveals that the plant consists of a crystalline material much like fine spun glass. Its beautiful and delicate appearance is enhanced by the way it catches rays of moonlight and refracts them through its petals, unleashing a dazzling spray of brilliant colors on the area around it. An average plant stands six to 18 inches tall.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Shimmerweed is unable to engage in any form of combat. It cannot move, has no means of inflicting damage on opponents, and is so delicate that the slightest of attacks instantly destroys it. Indeed, it has no motive at all to cause harm to other living things, as it feeds on moonlight.</div><div class='indent'>The defense mechanism a shimmerweed patch has is its dazzling light show. When the moonlight that feeds the plant is caught in its crystalline petals, it is enchanted and becomes so brilliant as to affect all creatures who gaze upon it with a <i>confusion</i> spell (as if cast by a 10th-level Red Robed wizard). The number of plants in the patch determines the effectiveness of this defense mechanism, with each plant able to affect 1 Hit Dice worth of opponents. Thus a patch of 12 plants can bewilder up to 12 Hit Dice of creatures.</div><div class='indent'>Shimmerweed cannot tolerate bright sunlight on its delicate petals, thus it opens only at night. Those who come across it by day, in fact, are unlikely to take notice of the patch, for it looks like nothing more than a grove of common weeds. The plant’s sensitivity to light is, however, a great weakness for it. Sudden exposure to a bright light source, such as a <i>continual light</i> spell, overloads its ability to draw nourishment with its petals, causing it to instantly shatter into fine dust. A patch destroyed in this manner is forever dead and cannot sprout again. Plants destroyed by any other means grow back in about one month.</div><div class='indent'>The dangerous thing about shimmerweed patches is that many creatures use them to hunt prey. It is not uncommon for an intelligent monster or animal to set its lair near a patch of shimmerweed and wait for it to confuse travelers. Once the travelers are helpless, these lurking hunters spring to the attack and slaughter their prey.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> Shimmerweed flowers are found in patches of 6d6 plants. Each patch grows from a single seedpod and all of the plants in it are linked together beneath the surface by fine tendrils that enable them to pool their stores of energy so that each may teed equally.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Shimmerweed is unique on the Prime Material plane for its unusual crystalline structure and its ability to feed directly on moonlight without use of photosynthesis.</div><div class='indent'>As might be expected, a plant as unusual as this has a most interesting means of reproduction. When a patch of shimmerweed reaches full growth (36 plants that are 18 inches tall), it begins to form a seedpod at its heart. The seedpod takes roughly 14 days to form and, when complete, is a spherical, rainbow-hued crystal roughly four inches in diameter. When fully formed and charged with energy, the seedpod bursts with a flash of light and a loud crack, sending fragments of itself as far as 15 yards from the parent plant. Only the larger portions of the shattered pod (1d6 in number) are viable and begin to grow. A patch of shimmerweed grows from podlings to mature adults in about eight months. The patch that spawned the seedpod withers and dies within days of the pod’s explosion.</div><div class='indent'>Shimmerweed seedpods are often used by wizards who are crafting magical palantirs such as <i>crystal balls</i> or <i>crystal hypnosis balls</i>. The petals of the flower, when ground into a fine sand, are used in the creation of inks and other materials that relate to light or hypnosis (such as a <i>gem of brightness</i>.)</div>",

    "Description": "<div>Skrits are carnivorous beetles that live in the cool deserts of Taladas. They are hulking creatures, approximately five to six feet in height.</div><div class='indent'>Similar in appearance to a flea, the skrit’s body is protected by a rough, domed carapace. A host of short spiny legs protrude out from under this shell. The head is small and can be retracted under this shell, which tapers back to a narrow, inflexible tail. The overall color of the shell is mottled black and brown, similar to the surrounding terrain.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> The skrit is a fierce predator, quick for its size. Too large to effectively stalk prey, it relies on natural camouflage. It settles among outcroppings of rock and waits unmoving for something to pass close by. While the skrit can be spotted by those who look for it, its camouflage works well enough to conceal it from casual observation at distances beyond 15 feet. Closer than this and the true nature of the “rock” is obvious to intelligent creatures who happen to look that way. Those attacked by a skrit have a -1 penalty applied to their surprise roll if the creature was not spotted.</div><div class='indent'>In combat, the skrit picks out a single target (normally the smallest or weakest looking of the player characters) and attacks it almost to the exclusion of all others. It attacks with its two feeble forelegs and its needle-like mouth. This mouth has retractable barbs, so that once a hit is scored the probe stays in place. Each turn thereafter, the skrit pumps a powerful enzyme into the victim’s bloodstream. At the same time, the creature attempts to drag its victim to a safe place where it can eat its prey.</div><div class='indent'>The enzyme has two effects. First it paralyzes the victim. The victim must roll a saving throw vs. poison each round the skrit is attached. A -1 penalty is applied to the saving throw for each round after the first. The paralysis lasts for 3d6 hours or until the enzyme is neutralized. Second, the enzyme also destroys cell tissue, slowly dissolving the body to a soupy gelatinous mass. This is what the skrit will later eat. This effect takes several hours. Victims are paralyzed by the time this occurs. The victim loses 10 hit points per hour from the cell tissue destruction. The enzyme can be halted with a neutralize poison spell. Damage from the bite and claws can be healed normally or through spells. Damage caused by the enzyme can only be healed normally or through regeneration.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> Skrits are solitary hunters with a limited range. They do nor make lairs, but inhabit patches of rough ground where their camouflage is most effective. Within this territory, skrits change hunting locations from day to day, depending on the amount of success.</div><div class='indent'>Skrits have both male and female members, distinguished only by the length of their tails. During the mating season in early spring, the female sends signals to the males by clattering its tail against the rocks. The males gather and combat for the right co be her mate. This is a particularly dangerous time to be among the rocks, for the males will attack anything that moves (+1 bonus to attack and damage rolls).</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> The skrit is an essential part of the desert ecological chain. Not only is it an important predator, but after death its body plays a role in the life of the desert dwellers. The huge carapace becomes home for many creatures; most of these are benign or at least of no great threat to adventurers. Sometimes, however, the shells are taken over by huge colonies of ants. The domed shell becomes the home to a ferocious swarm, quite dangerous to disturb.</div><div class='indent'>The shell can also be fashioned into an excellent armor by those skilled in handling the peculiar material. Skilled craftsmen use the carapace to fashion breastplates and other solid pieces of armor. A suit fashioned from this material has an AC 4.</div>",

    "Description": "<div>Spectral minions are the spirits of humans or demihumans who died before they could fulfill their vows. Even in death, spectral minions are bound to the vows or quests placed upon them while they were alive.</div><div class='indent'>Spectral minions appear as they were in life, except that they are nearly transparent. Like ghosts, spectral minions do not fully exist on the Prime Material plane. Spectral minions retain the Hit Dice, attack, damage ratings, alignment, and language of their former selves. Regardless of their intelligence in their previous lives, all spectral minions are average intelligence. They retain some but not necessarily all of the memories of their original forms, as spectral miruons, their uncompleted quests and vows dominate their minds. All spectral minions have a movement rate of 30.</div><div class='indent'>There are six general types of spectral minions: berserkers, guardians, philosophers, revelers, searchers, and warriors. The types cannot be distinguished by appearance, but their attitudes and behavior are quite different, as detailed in the description of each type.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Spectral minions can inflict damage only if they died holding weapons. Such weapons become a part of their spectral forms. Long swords are the most typical, but daggers, bows, staves, and other melee weapons are also common. These weapons inflict the same amount of damage as they would if wielded by living creatures. Since their weapons are part of them, spectral minions cannot be disarmed.</div><div class='indent'>The speed of spectral minions gives them a -1 bonus to all initiative rolls. They can be hit only by +1 or better weapons. Though spectral minions cannot use magic themselves, they are 20% magic resistant.</div><div class='indent'>If a spectral minion is destroyed, or if its vows or quests are fulfilled, the spectral minion (and its weapon) disappears forever. This also occurs if <i>remove curse</i> or a similar spell is cast upon it. A spectral minion cannot be turned.</div><div class='indent'>Certain types of spectral minions have special attacks These are explained in the individual listings.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> Spectral minions are cursed to relive the events leading to their death, endlessly trying to fulfill their vows. Outdoors, they must stay within 1,000 yards of where they died. Indoors, they must stay in the corridor or room where they lost their lives. On very rare occasions where a quest required them to perform an act over a wide area, they are tree to roam within that area.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Spectral minions do not age, nor do they perform any physiological functions; though they may appear to be eating or drinking, these actions have no meaningful effects.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Berserkers:</b> Some spectral minions become overwhelmed by despair. Losing all hope of ever being freed from their charge, these minions are eventually driven into a berkserking frenzy. Others become mindless killers as soon as they become minions because of an unresolved obsession in their former lives; for instance, a spectral minion cook might become a berserker because someone in the past criticized his cooking and was no longer around to apologize for the remark.</div><div class='indent'>All berserker spectral minions are of chaotic evi1 alignment. They fanatically attack any intruders who stumble into their territory. They refuse to parley and pursue intruders as far as possible. All berserker spectral minions are armed and gain a +1 bonus to their attack and damage rolls. Additionally, berserkers can make two attacks per round, they are the only spectral minions with this ability.</div><div class='indent'>In all cases, berserker spectral minions have rebelled against their quests and have no hope of ever being freed from their charges. Even if a sympathetic character is able to discover the nature of a berserker minion’s unfulfilled quest, resolving it will not cause the spectral minion to disappear; in the case of the spectral minion cook, finding the poor soul who insulted him in his former life and forcing him to apologize will not cause the minion to vanish. Berserker spectral minions can only be vanquished if they are destroyed or if <i>remove curse</i> or a similar spell is cast upon them</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Guardians:</b> These spectral minions were quested to defend a room, a passage, or an object. In most cases, they served asSpectral Minion guards for some important location and died at their posts.</div><div class='indent'>Guardian spectral minions are freed from their confinement it they successfully defend their posts against intruders for 100 years and a day, or complete some other assigned task.</div><div class='indent'>Occasionally, guardians respond to a password or signal, allowing characters to pass safely.</div><div class='indent'>All guardians are armed and are usually of chaotic or neutral good alignment. They defend themselves if attacked or if their post is threatened, but otherwise they are not particularly hostile. More than anything, guardian spectral minions want to be released from their vows and to be freed of their responsibilities.</div><div class='indent'>The following are some examples of guardian spectral minions:<ul><li>A guardian is assigned to watch over the coffins of a royal family in a sealed tomb. He is so weary of his eternal duty that he speaks openly to any intruders who treat him kindly. If an intruder tells him that he is relieved of his duty-regardless of whether the intruder has any actual authority to do so-the guardian is released from his vow and disappears.</li><li>A guardian floats above a large golden chair in an otherwise empty room. It is his responsibility to guard the chair from intruders. If an intruder speaks the password persevere, the minion is released from his vows and free of his responsibilities. Characters can pass through the room unharmed, so long as they do not approach the chair. If an intruder does not speak the password, the guardian attacks until the intruder leaves. The guardian is released from his vows after he has guarded the chair for 100 years and a day.</li><li>A guardian sits behind a marble counter in a dusty room. He is required to collect a visitor’s tax from all intruders. if the intruder pays the tax, the guardian allows him to pass; if not, the guardian attacks him. When the guardian has spent 100 years and a day collecting taxes, he is released from his vows.</li></ul></div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Philosophers:</b> Philosophers are spectral minions who spend their time in study and contemplation, usually in libraries or museums. They are extremely knowledgeable. If given the chance, they talk at great length about subjects that interest them.</div><div class='indent'>Philosophers can be of any alignment. Often they arc found in groups of two or more engaged in heated debate; it is their curse to endlessly discuss philosophic issues left unresolved in their former lives. philosophers usually do not tolerate interruptions, but they have been known to ask intruders for their opinions about an issue under discussion. They attack only if their honesty is questioned or if they have to defend themselves.</div><div class='indent'>A party may sometimes encounter a group of spectral minions hovering off the ground about 1d4 + 1 feet. These are philosopher minions lost deep in thought. The floating philosophers often invite questions from an intruder. With each response, the philosophers drop a foot closer to the ground. If the philosophers reach the ground, they become enraged that the intruder has asked too many questions, then summon help, usually 1d8 warrior minions from an adjacent area.</div><div class='indent'>Similarly, a group of philosophers may be encountered floating several feet off the ground while involved in an animated discussion. They, too, invite questions from an intruder. However, when one philosopher has given his response, one of the otherstotally disagrees, triggering a pointless argument that continues for 1d6 rounds with half of the minions taking one side and half taking the other. As before, the minions drop a foot closer to the ground with each response, but in this case, the entire group disappears as soon as one of them touches the ground.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Revelers:</b> These minions arc cursed to celebrate madly for all eternity. When encountered, they are engaged in one of the following activities:<ul><li>Frenzied dancing</li><li>Drinking spectral ale or wine</li><li>Chasing members of the opposite sex</li><li>Playing musical instruments</li><li>Dining gluttonously</li></ul></div><div class='indent'>Reveler spectral minions arc chaotic evil. Though unarmed, they can be quite dangerous. Any character seen by the revelers may be surrounded by them, if they’ re looking for more guests for their party as determined by the DM). The revelers beckon to the character, laughing and shrieking, urging him to join their fun. If the character joins the revelers for da least three consecutive rounds, he must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell to resist them. It the character successfully resists them, the revelers ignore the character and resume their frolicking.</div><div class='indent'>If the character fails the saving throw, he immediately slumps to the floor in a deep sleep. The affected character cannot be awakened by dispel magic or by any other magic short of a wish. While asleep, the character’s spirit essence visibly leaves his body to join the minions in their revelry. Meanwhile, the character oses one level of experience for every turn his essence is engaged in revelry with the minions. If all of the revelers (except the character) are slain, the character revives; lost experience is regained at the rate of one level per four hours after the character awakens. Some revelers may even trap the character forever unless rescued, but such situations are rare.</div><div class='indent'>If the revelers have no interest in inviting intruders to their party, they surround any intruders who provoke them as described above; if the intruders remain in the room with the revelers for three consecutive rounds, they must roll successful saving throws to resist falling asleep and losing experience levels. Searchers: Searchers arc spectral minions that stalk endlessly through their territory, searching for a particular object to fulfill their quest. These creatures were questing when they died in their original forms, and usually the object of the quest is not found within he searcher’s range Only if someone brings the object of the search to the minion can the creature’s spirit be freed.</div><div class='indent'>All searchers are armed and are usually lawful evil in ailgnment. They are very dangerous, for they destroy anything that stands between them and their unreachable goals.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Warriors:</b> These minions are the spirits of mortals who were locked in combat at the time of death, usually soldiers who died in bloody battles. Groups of 100 or more warrior spectral minions are typically encountered on a battlefield, including fighters of differing alignments from both sides or a battle.</div><div class='indent'>Warrior minions are always armed and fight each other constantly. However, in all cases, the minion-versus-minion combat produces no lasting damage, and the net effect is an eternal conflict between the groups. Only through the intervention of mortals can the tide of battle be turned in favor of one side or the other. Typically, characters of good alignment are approached by the leader of the good spectral minion warriors, who tries to convince them to join his side in an upcoming battle the good minion leader promises to help them, usually by supplying needed information, if good triumphs over evil.Usually, the characters need to slay at least 80% of the evil minion forces to win the battle. If the battle is won, the evil warriors disappear and the good warriors respond with a victory shout. After the good leader helps the characters as promised, he and the other good minions disappear, at last released from their quest.</div>",

    "Description": "</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Whisper Spider</b></div><br/><div>The whisper spider has a plump abdomen, multiple eyes, and four pairs of segmented legs Its body is covered with short, black bristles. Two gray stripes run the length of its back. Its eyes are bright red The whisper spider moves quite rapidly on its webs and can also make six-foot leaps in any direction.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> The whisper spider uses lures and misdirection to capture prey It can create a false spider, a flapping banner, a filmy barrier to hide behind, or any other shape it has seen. It creates ten-foot-square web sheets to trap prey and gain a better chance to inflict a killing bite. It also shoots web strands up to two feet away to bind foes (treat as if the target is AC 10), though it cannot make a melee attack in the same round it shoots webbing. A victim in contact with a web must roll a saving throw vs. wand; if he fails, he is stuck fast as if caught in a web spell.</div><div class='indent'>If a whisper spider makes a successful bite attack, the victim must roll a saving throw vs. poison with a -2 penalty. It the roll fails, the victim tails into a stupor for 2d4 turns, the victim can take no actions until the poison wears off.</div><div class='indent'>A whisper spider can flatten itself against the ground and become 80% undetectable. It moves so silently that opponents have a -5 penalty to their surprise rolls.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> The whisper spider’s lair is a large web, usually concealed in tree branches or inside a cave. It keeps treasure items taken from consumed victims in a hole in the ground near its web, or in hollow trees.</div><div class='indent'>The females of both species eat their mates 50% of the time; the more fortunate males are able to scramble to safety. Females lay about 100 eggs at once, but fewer than 20% actually hatch. The whisper spider keeps her babies on her back until they mature, a period of about three to four months.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Most predators avoid these dangerous spiders, though spider babies are eaten by birds, frogs, bats, and small mammals. Giant snakes sometimes eat adult spiders.</div><div class='indent'>Both spider species eat any warm-blooded creature they can ensnare. Favorites include monkeys, wild boars, herd animals and humans.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Giant Trap Door Spider</b></div><br/><div>Like the whisper spider, the trap door spider has a plump abdomen, multiple eyes, and four pairs of segmented legs. Its body is covered with long, silky hairs, either brown or gold in color. Its legs are banded with red stripes.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> The trap door spider lives at the bottom of a deep tunnel. It covers the entrance to the tunnel with a door of sticks, weeds, webbing, and mud, then waits at the bottom for victims. The spider can detect the vibrations of approaching creatures up to 50 yards away. When a victim comes within ten feet of the trap door, the spider scrambles out of the tunnel and attacks. Because the spider moves quickly and silently, the intended victim has a 55 penalty to his surprise roll. The spider attempts to grab its victim by making a normal attack roil; if successful, the spider drags the victim back into the tunnel and starts to eat him. A grabbed victim can free himself with a successful Strength check (with a -2 penalty). At least two characters whose Strength totals 20 or more can wrench a companion loose. While the spider has a hold on a victim, it can make no other attacks.</div><div class='indent'>If a trap door spider makes a successful bite attack, the victim must roll a successful saving throw vs. poison or suffer an additional 1d6 points of damage. The trap door spider can shoot web strands up to three feet away.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> Trap door spiders live in their underground tunnels. A tunnel is usually about ten feet in diameter and can be as much as 100 feet deep. The bottom of the tunnel sometimes contains two chambers, the second used to store treasure items.</div><div class='indent'>The female trap door spider creates a silken web sack on the side of the tunnel to hold her eggs. When the eggs hatch, the young spiders crawl from the tunnel to make their own way in the world.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> See above.</div>",

They have tapered heads with sensitive noses, huge dark eyes, and large ears that are capable of moving in any direction to pick up sounds.</div><div class='indent'>Stags have two branching antlers growing from the top of their skulls Stag antlers are hard and bony, covered with a velvety fuzz The antlers are primarily used as a symbol of leadership, but are also used when dueling for mates or fighting off enemies. Some stags living in colder climates shed their antlers in the winter, growing new ones the following spring.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Normally, wild stags are docile and passive, but when challenged, they defend their herds against all but the most fearsome opponents. A stag usually attacks by charging head down, butting opponents with his antlers. He can also attack by lashing out with his sharp fore hooves His antler attack inflicts 2d4 points of damage, while his fore hooves inflict ld3 points of damage each.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> Stags are found in temperate forests and meadows in all parts of Krynn. They have no permanent lairs, grazing from field to field in search of food or to avoid predators. Though some migrate for hundreds of miles, most herds remain in the same general area throughout their lives. They spend their days foraging for food and basking in the sun, and their nights sleeping among bushes or tall grasses. For each wild stag in a herd, there are 2d4 fawns and does. A doe gives birth to one or two fawns in a secluded area; the fawns remain hidden until they are old enough to run with the herd.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Stags eat grams, fruits, seeds, and twigs. They are often the victims of wolves, hunters, and other predators. Wild stags are domesticated by Kagonesti elves who use them as mounts. The gods of good use the white stag to guide or otherwise assist favored characters.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Giant Stags</b></div><br><div>Giant stags are larger versions of wild stags, often topping seven feet in height and weighing in excess of 1,500 pounds A giant stags antler attack inflicts 4d4 points of damage, while his fore hooves inflict 1d4 points of damage each Otherwise, the giant stag conforms to the general characteristics of the wild stag.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>The White Stag</b></div><br/><div>The white stag is an enchanted wild stag chosen by the gods of good to serve as their messenger. The white stag resembles a giant stag, but its coat is pure white. At night, its coat radiates a soft glow of white light. When angered, its eyes burn fiery red. The white stag can communicate telepathically; it only communicates with creatures of good alignment, however.</div><div class='indent'>The white stag makes attacks similar to those of the wild stag, though its superior strength and size enables it to inflict significantly more damage. Additionally, the white stag has special abilities that it uses to assist creatures of good alignment. It can cast <i>find the path</i> at will; it uses this ability to help friendly characters avoid dangers or to show them the most direct routes to their destinations. The white stag can also cast <i>speak with animal</i> at will to learn information that it sometimes telepathically passes along to befriended creatures. Finally, the white stag has the ability to cast a bless spell three times per day. The white stag has habits similar to those of the wild stag, but he is often active at night, sleeping during the day.</div><div class='indent'>The white stag cannot be captured: if necessary, it fights to the death.

    "Description": "<div>Inhabiting an isolated jungle island in the middle of the Courrain Ocean, the taylings are a race of intelligent humanoids. Every birth results in twins, one bestial (taylang) and the other demihuman (tayling). The minds of the twins are telepathically linked, sharing each other’s thoughts, emotions, and experiences as if they inhabited the others body.</div><div class='indent'>From the moment of birth, the twins cannot bear to be apart and are never voluntarily separated by more than a mile, which is the limit of their telepathic connection. If a separation does occur, the tayling becomes anxious and irrational, fearing something has happened to his twin, while the taylang simply becomes vicious, attacking anything in sight. Even after being reunited, the twins are seldom the same after such an experience. The tayling usually becomes unbalanced and paranoid, and is apt to accuse friends and acquaintances of plotting to cause him harm. The taylang grows unpredictable and violent, behaving affectionately one moment and attacking to kill in the next. Should the pair remain separated for a fortnight or more the tayling stops eating and wastes away. The taylang usually kills itself by attacking some creature of great power.</div><div class='indent'>Though always vaguely human in form, the taylang may resemble any sort of woodland creature from a great bear to a slinky reptile. It is usually large, in the neighborhood of seven fret tall, and quite husky. In contrast, the tayling is rather small, with alabaster skin, a delicate frame, and possessed of fine features resembling those of an elf.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> In combat, the twins make an efficient fighting machine. With his great strength and speed the brutish taylang is a natural fighter and warrior. On the other hand, the intelligent tayling is a cunning tactician and natural spellcaster. Given these complementary abilities and the capability of coordinating strategy telepathically, it is little wonder that these creatures receive several benefits in battle.</div><div class='indent'>First, due to their telepathic connection, the twins receive two initiative benefits: They are surprised only on a roll of 1, and they receive a -1 bonus to their initiative roll each round. Second, they have a 75% chance of recognizing enemy spellcasters before the battle begins, and they receive a +1 bonus to their saving throws. Third, because the tayling telepathically knows the taylang’s condition at all times, the tayling can sometimes prevent his twin from falling unconscious or dead, even after the taylang’s hit points have fallen below 0. If the tayling possesses any means of healing his twin, such as spells, potions, or similar capabilities, he can use his next action to heal the taylang. Assuming the results restore the taylang to positive hit points, it is treated as if it had never died-no system shock or resurrection survival roll is needed.</div><div class='indent'>During the battle itself, the most common tactic for tayling twins is for the taylang to hold the opponent at bay while the tayling uses spells to ensure a combat advantage. Taylings can cast spells either as wizards or priests varying in levels from 1-10. Wizards always choose their spells from the Alteration school, and priests only have major access to the Elemental sphere.</div><div class='indent'>After the tayling casts his spells, the taylang then closes in to finish the job, supported by the tayling’s spells, or by physical attacks if need be.</div><div class='indent'>Should one of the twins perish in battle, the survivor immediately loses its initiative and saving throw bonuses. However, the survivor enters a maniacal state of mind and attacks without regard to its own safety. For the tayling, this means casting the most destructive spells it knows, without regard to personal safety, then attacking hand-to-hand. The taylang enters a killing rage, during which it receives a +3 bonus to its attack roll, can keep attacking until reaching -20 hit points, and shrugs off all effects of magic. For example, if the tayling twin is killed during round two of battle, and an enemy mage casts a <i>color spray</i> on the taylang at the beginning of round three, the taylang ignores the effects of the spell.</div><div class='indent'>As outlined above, a lone tayling twin that survives a battle soon perishes. For this reason, it is exceptionally difficult to make tayling twins flee combat. Neither twin flees unless the other is also fleeing. In effect, both twins must decide to flee before either leaves.</div><div class='indent'>For this same reason, a surviving tayling twin never forgives its twin’s killers. Should a party flee after killing a twin, the other hunts the party down and mercilessly attempts to slay every person involved in the twin’s death.</div><div class='indent'>Among the taylings, war is unknown, for their villages have always co-existed peacefully. Should organized combat become necessary, however, it is extremely doubtful that they could adapt to the rigid structure and discipline required to forge a successful army. It seems most likely that they would use the rugged jungle terrain of their island home to engage in guerilla warfare.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> The tayling species inhabits an isolated jungle island located far out in the Courrain Ocean, and remain blissfully unaware of the violent forces shaping the rest of Krynn. Their island, which they simply call Land, is the result of a large volcanic upthrust. At its center rises a huge, still-active volcano that sends a constant plume of steam and smoke into the atmosphere. From a distance, this makes Land appear to be nothing more than a cumulus cloud. (Perhaps this accounts for the fact that it remains undiscovered and uncharted even today.) The flanks of the volcano, which the taylings call Pillar-That-HoldsThe-Sky, are covered with dense fields of ice. These glaciers are the source of the cool streams that keep Land watered and lush.</div><div class='indent'>At sea level, Land is a jungle paradise, populated with all manner of beasts and plant. Food is plentiful and the weather is moderate, so the taylings living here experience little strife, other than occasionally falling prey to the ferocious animals that roam the jungle. As one might expect, those living at sea level tend to view life as a merry party.</div><div class='indent'>Higher up Pillar-That-Holds-The-Sky’s slopes, life is not so pleasant. Here, the weather is colder and the land more barren, so those who choose to abide here have developed a harsher outlook on life and tend to be harder workers than their low-elevation fellows. The taylings here must work harder to raise their crops in narrow terraces built into the flanks of Pillar-That-Holds-TheSky, and the taylangs must spend more time and trouble hunting. They regard low-elevation taylings and taylangs as lazy no-goods who would rather sleep all day than do any work. (Their lowelevation cousins find this rather amusing. They cannot understand what possesses their relations to live at high altitude and waste all their time trying to scratch a living out of the volcano’s flanks. At the base of the Pillar there is plenty of everything just for the taking.)</div><div class='indent'>At both high and low elevations, the taylings live in individual huts in villages. The taylangs lead a more feral existence, prowling around the outskirts and hunting by night. Needless to say, it is very difficult to sneak up on a tayling village.</div><div class='indent'>Not surprisingly, both the high-altitude and low-altitude taylings view the Pillar-That-Holds-The-Sky as the ultimate deity. They attribute it with making the land upon which they live, bringing forth the plants they eat, and spewing up the air which they breathe. Therefore, the low- and high-elevation taylings cooperate in maintaining a small monastery at the icy summit. It is the duty of the priests who reside here to constantly express the gratitude of the tayling people. In return, the rest of the tayimg population supplies the monastery with food, clothing, and other necessities.</div><div class='indent'>The monastery sends a priest to each village to act as the local spiritual guide and counselor. At the high elevations, this priest serves the function of a chief and has authority over all aspects of community life, from planting to procreation. Priests serving in low-elevation villages, however, are seen as little more than party organizers for the many festivals of celebration.</div><div class='indent'>At both low and high elevations, procreation is one of the more complicated aspects of tayling life. Like everything else in life, the twins must make their choices together, and must select another pair of twins as mates. Because the twins can be any mix of sexes (both female, female taylang and male tayling, male taylang and female tayling, or both male), finding a compatible set of twins can be quite difficult. The taylang twin must make his /her selection first, as the differences in taylang forms can limit his /her range of mates. The tayling twin then investigates the other pair’s tayling and, ideally, finds that the tayling is of the correct sex and attractive. When these arrangements are finally completed, both twins mate with their counterparts in the opposite pair.</div><div class='indent'>No permanent bonds are formed between pairs of twins for no attachment could possibly be as great as that between the twins themselves. After the mating, the twin pairs part ways. A year later, the females give birth to a set of twins. The twins are raised by their mothers, with only occasional and accidental contact with their fathers. If a pair of twins is unlucky enough to consist of two males, it never enjoys the privilege of raising children.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Taylangs subsist soiely on a diet of fresh meat, which they take great pleasure in hunting. Taylmgs are vegetarians At low elevations, they meet their needs solely by gathering wild fruit, nuts, berries, and etc. At high elevations, they spend Incredible amounts of effort and energy farming the grams that form the staples of their diet. When great strength is needed, such as during plowing, they often enlist the reluctant help of their taylang siblings.</div>",

    "Description": "<div>Thanoi, also known as walrus men, are a bizarre blend of the human and walrus races. In spite of their great bulk, they can maneuver surprisingly well; their clawed feet enable them to maintain a good pace over ice or snow.</div><div class='indent'>Thanoi have thick, cylindrical bodies with human arms and legs, and faces much like walruses. They have huge, padded feet that resemble the flippers of fish. Webs of skin grow between their toes to help them swim. They have hooked claws on their toes, useless as weapons, but good for traction. Their hands are much like those of humans: the blunt fingers are capable of holding a staff or throwing a spear.</div><div class='indent'>Their bodies are protected by tough, leathery skin, dark gray or brown in color. Folds of skin hang under their arms, below their chins, and around their waists. Thanoi skin has a fishy aroma, detectable from a distance of several feet. Thick layers of fat lie beneath the surface of their skin, insulating them from the cold; thanoi swim in the iciest of waters and suffer no ill effects. Although their ears are completely covered by skin, thanoi hear quite clearly.</div><div class='indent'>Thanoi have two wide nostrils in the center of their faces. Their eyes are small and dark, usually black or deep blue in color. They have wide mouths with thin lips and rows of blunt teeth strong enough to crunch bones. A row of coarse bristles lines the upper lip and hangs over the mouth: these bristles are used to sweep away snow when digging and to strain water when drinking.</div><div class='indent'>The most distinguishing features of thanoi are their tusks. The tusks are made of solid bone, several inches thick, and grow to a length of nearly three feet in the largest adults. The tusks are actually modified incisors, extending from the creatures upper row of teeth and down over the bottom lip. The tusks grow in such a way that they do not interfere with eating or speech. The tusks can be used as formidable weapons. They can also be used for digging, with the upper lip bristles used to sweep away debris.</div><div class='indent'>Female thanoi are not significantly different in appearance from the males. Their tusks are somewhat shorter, averaging about two feet long, and their bodies are slightly less thick. Their hides tend to be lighter shades of gray and brown.</div><div class='indent'>Thanoi have no need to use clothing for warmth, but they occasionally use it for decoration. Females sometimes wear short capes made of bear or wolf fur Males wear long scarves of the same materials. Kagog, the thanoi medicine women, are distinguished by crowns of bones, usually made from fish spines. All apparel is designed to be easily removed, since thanoi prefer to enter the water unadorned so their swimming is not impaired.</div><div class='indent'>Thanoi move on land by combining shuffling and waddling motions. Thanks to their flipperlike feet, thanoi are quite comfortable in the water. They are able to hold their breath for long periods; large adults can remain underwater for as long as 30 minutes without surfacing. Thanoi have small blow holes on the backs of their necks, similar to those of whales. When a swimming thanoi needs air, it floats to the surface, opens its valvelike blow hole, fills its lungs with air, then submerges again.</div><div class='indent'>Thanoi speech sounds like a cacophony of grunts, snarls, and coughs to other races, but it is actually a quite sophisticated language. Their spoken words are supplemented by non-verbal signs, such as chest slaps and facial twitches. The language is so complex that only 5% of characters with an Intelligence of 16 or over can understand them. However, evil races, such as the minotaurs, have a significantly better chance of understanding the thanoi language, especially if thanoi demonstrate their basic vocabulary. In addition to their own language, 20% of thanoi speak common.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Because the thanoi are seldom in contact with other races, they are not used to fighting experienced combatants: other intelligent races find thanoi tactics to be crude at best. Thanoi take tactical advantage of their ability to maneuver on ice and snow and attempt to ambush opponents from behind whenever possible. Otherwise, thanoi simply charge their enemies with their weapons swinging and hope for the best.</div><div class='indent'>Because of their strength, any weapon used by a thanoi does 2 more points of damage than normal. Weapons used by thanoi include daggers, long swords, battle axes, clubs, spears, and maces, most of them made from bones, stone, and wood. The thanoi also use <i>frostreavers</i>, which are <i>battle axes +4</i> made by Ice Folk (see the “Ice Folk“ section, under “Human, Krynn”, for more about these unusual weapons). Thanoi construct sturdy harpoons from wooden shafts with stone or metal points on one end and leather straps on the other. When used for stabbing, a thanoi harpoon inflicts 2d4 points of damage against medium-sized opponents and 2d6 points of damage against large opponents. When a thanoi hurls his harpoon by its strap, then the harpoon inflicts an additional 2 points of damage (only the thanoi receive this bonus, thanks to their special hurling technique).</div><div class='indent'>Thanoi hands are not flexible, preventing the use of bows and similar weapons. However, a thanoi’s tusks are extremely effective in melee. Instead of using a weapon, a thanoi can make two tusk attacks against the same opponent, causing 2d4 points of damage with each tusk.</div><div class='indent'>Thanoi do not wear armor. Not only do their tough hides provide armorlike protection, the bulky thanoi find artificial armor extremely uncomfortable.</div><div class='indent'>Thanoi are immune to all forms of cold, both natural and magical, but this immunity has its disadvantages. They suffer 1 extra point of damage per die from any fire-based attacks, whether magical or nonmagical. Additionally, thanoi may suffer damage if exposed to climates above freezing. In climates with average temperatures between 32° and 40° F, thanoi feel discomfort. For every week in an environment with average temperatures higher than 40° F, thanoi lose 1d4+1 hit points.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> The thanoi are not known for their intelligence. They are hostile and suspicious toward strangers, though they are cordial to other thanoi tribes and cooperative with evil races with whom they share common goals.</div><div class='indent'>Thanoi kill for the sheer joy of it. They are fiercely territorial, and they mercilessly slaughter trespassers. They also engage in recreational killing of animals, the more helpless, the better; a band of thanoi would not, for instance, attack a dragon, but they would relish the opportunity to massacre a family of seals.</div><div class='indent'>Thanoi live only in regions of extreme cold. Most live on ocean shores, but some tribes make their homes on drifting glaciers. Thanoi have no permanent settlements, relocating when they have exhausted the hunting and fishing in a particular area.</div><div class='indent'>Several families live together to form a tribe. An average family consists of a mated pair and one or two offspring. The entire tribe comprises about 20 members, equally divided between males and females. Females give birth to one or two babies every two years. A young thanoi grows to maturity in about 20 years; immature thanoi (ages 2-20) cannot use weapons, but can make tusk attacks causing 1d4 points of damage each. An immature thanoi has 2 Hit Dice. Thanoi have a life span of about 60 years.</div><div class='indent'>Thanoi homes are constructed from blocks of ice shaped to the desired size with their tusks. Pots of burning oil furnish light. A hole in the ceiling provides ventilation.</div><div class='indent'>A tribe of thanoi always has a leader. This leader is usually the meanest and most aggressive male and must be at least 30 years old. The leader always has at least 5 Hit Dice. All decisions for the tribe are made by the leader. A leader picks another aggressive tribesman to serve as his deputy; in case of the leader’s death, the deputy assumes leadership. If the tribe runs out of eligible members to serve as leaders, they are absorbed into another tribe.</div><div class='indent'>The eldest female of a tribe serves as its medicine woman, called the kagog. The kagog can cast <i>cure serious wounds</i> and <i>predict weather</i>, each three times per day (<i>predict weather</i> enables the kagog to know the weather for the next 24 hours within a 30-mile radius; the spell is 90% accurate). Knowledge of these spells is passed from kagog to kagog; as in the case of the leader, the kagog chooses and trains her own successor.</div><div class='indent'>Thanoi collect treasure items, although not for their monetary value They mainly use the shiny coins and gems for good luck charms and fishing lures.</div><div class='indent'>Thanoi often tame and tram ice bears as tracking animals. They sometimes use the ice bears to pull massive sleds over the snow; a typical sled holds a dozen thanoi and is pulled by a team of two ice bears. The sleds are made of wood and bone, thanoi coat the runners with fish fat or seal blubber for maximum speed.</div><div class='indent'>Thanoi sometimes carry pots of oil (specially distilled from deposits found on the ocean floor) and pouches of burning embers with them on the sleds. The oil pots are ignited, then tossed on enemies. This is a particularly effective tactic when attempting to disable vehicles, such as the iceboats of the Ice Folk. Thanoi can also ride bareback on icebears; this is helpful when the thanoi need to cross an area of deep, soft snow, since the bears can easily traverse the largest drifts.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Thanoi can sometimes be convinced to ally with evil races; however, thanoi are too independent-minded to form lasting alliances. They have strong relationships with the ice bears; ice bears are used as hunting partners and also as allies against common enemies. Thanoi hunting parties often prowl glacial areas looking for the hated Ice Folk, with whom they have violent, unending territorial disputes. Ice Folk hunt thanoi for their blubber, their hides (from which they make warm clothing), and their tusks (from which they make jewelry and weapons).</div><div class='indent'>Aside from their weapons, thanoi produce no items of value and, priding themselves on their self-reliance, never engage in trade. However, thanoi-constructed weapons are highly sought collector’s items, particularly thanoi harpoons.</div><div class='indent'>Thanoi primarily eat the fish that are trapped in the ice-covered lakes in their domains. They also enjoy the flesh of seals, whales, and sea birds. They are not above eating carrion. Thanoi always eat their meat raw.</div>",

When in the passive mode, the controller can take any normal actions, but he is unable to see through the warriors eyes; the skeleton warrior remains inert while the controller is in passive mode. The controller can change between the passive mode and active control at will.</div><div class='indent'>The controller must have the warriors circlet on his head in order to control the warrior. If the circlet is removed from the controllers head, he can no longer control the warrior; likewise, if the controller and the warrior are separated by more than 240 feet, the controller can no longer control the warrior. If the circlet remains in the controllers possession, he can resume control at a later time. But if the controller loses the circlet, either by accident or by a deliberate act, the warrior immediately proceeds toward the controller at twice its normal movement rate (12) to attack and destroy him. The warrior does not rest until it destroys its former controller or until control is reestablished. If the warrior holds the circlet to its head, both the warrior and the circlet turn to dust, never to reappear.</div><div class='indent'>When a character first comes into possession of a circlet, he is unlikely to be aware that the skeleton warrior is tracking him, unless he recognizes the circlets significance. To establish control for the first time, the character not only must hold the circlet to his head, he must be able to see the warrior and concentrate on the establishment of control for one round and then roll a successful Wisdom check, if he fails the Wisdom check, he can try again in subsequent rounds. Meanwhile, the skeleton warrior continues to approach, attempting to destroy the character and gain possession of the circlet. If his concentration is broken before control is establishedfor instance, if he has to defend himself against an attack-he must concentrate again for three rounds Once control has been established for the first time, it can only be broken as indicated above. To be effective, the circlet cannot be worn with any other headgear; placing it in a helm, for instance, nullifies its powers, though the skeleton warrior is still aware of the circlets presence.</div><div class='indent'>Skeleton warriors usually fight with two-handed swords, but they can use other weapons as well. Skeleton warriors make all weapon attacks with a +3 bonus to their attack roll, this is an innate ability, the weapon itself is not magical.</div><div class='indent'>Only magical weapons affect skeleton warriors They have a 90% magical resistance. The mere sight of a skeleton warrior causes any creature with fewer than 5 Hit Dice to flee in panic. Skeleton warriors cannot be turned by priests.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> Skeleton warriors are usually found near the areas where they died in their former lives, or where they were buried. A skeleton warrior usually has a sizeable collection of treasure, the remnants of a lifetime of adventure. Since a skeleton warrior is preoccupied with recovering its circlet, protecting its treasure is not a priority.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> Skeleton warriors are used by their controllers as bodyguards, servants, or workers. Since skeleton warriors are obsessed with their circlets and are therefore undependable, evil creatures and other undead seldom associate with them Skeleton warriors do not eat, sleep, or perform any other physiological functions.</div>",

All known records of her reign were destroyed by the Silvanesti, and only fragments of rumors remain.

Wichtlin are unaffected by poison and paralyzation. They are immune to <i>sleep</i>, <i>charm</i>, <i>hold</i>, and cold-based spells; fire scores normal damage. They can only be hit with +1 or better magical weapons. Holy water causes 2d4 points of damage per vial.

However, the wichtlin stag can only be hit by +1 or better magical weapons. If a victim is struck by an antler attack, he must roll a successful saving throw vs. paralyzation or become paralyzed for 2d4 rounds.

    "Description": "<div>The wyndlass is a tentacled horror that lurks in desolate swamps and gloomy forests. A powerful predator, it has been known to devour several whole horses at a time in its quest to satisfy its awesome hunger. Few living men can tell the tale of a firsthand encounter with a wyndlass, as few ever survive such a meeting.</div><div class='indent'>Although the wyndlass is seldom (if ever) seen by those it hunts, there have been occasions when it was sighted out of its pit by those with the sense to quickly note its appearance and then flee for their lives. From these accounts we know that the wyndlass looks something like a giant black octopus with no fewer than ten tentacles. Each of these whiplike limbs is over 25 feet long and covered with keen barbs that sink deep into the flesh of prey. The tendrils attach to the body in two clusters of five limbs each. Between the two clusters are the creature’s three eyes (which glow with a faint blue light) and its powerful beak.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> When a wyndlass has buried itself in its quicksand pit (see “Ecology”), it lies very still and awaits the passing of a potential victim. As soon as something steps into its pit, the horror unfurls its tendrils and grabs hold of the prey, pulling it under the surface of the quicksand. When the wyndlass attacks in this manner, it imposes a -5 penalty to its opponents’ surprise rolls. Once a victim is pulled beneath the surface of the quicksand pit, it quickly suffocates (see “Holding Your Breath”, 2nd Edition <i>Player’s Handbook</i>, page 122) and can be devoured by the wyndlass at its leisure.</div><div class='indent'>Anyone caught in the grip of the wyndlass cannot take any action to defend himself from the attacks of the other tentacles or the bite of the beak. As a rule, the wyndlass devotes one of its tendril clusters to each opponent; thus, although it has ten limbs, the wyndlass can attack only two opponents at once. In addition, the creature’s beak can bite only those who are held in its tendrils.</div><div class='indent'>Anyone who attempts to wrench himself free of the wyndlass’s tendrils is torn and cut by the barbs that cover their surface. Whenever an ensnared character attempts to break free, he must roll a successful bend bars/lift gates check. In so doing, however, he suffers 1d6 points of damage for each limb that was wrapped about him.</div><div class='indent'>The wyndlass takes no delight in killing and is not an evil creature, but its great size requires that it hunt very often and this has led to its reputation as an evil and hateful thing.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> The wyndlass is a solitary creature that spends most of its life at the bottom of its quicksand pit awaiting prey. Most intelligent creatures stay well clear of a wyndlass’s lair (if they learn about it before being devoured).</div><div class='indent'>A wyndlass sets up its lair by burrowing into the earth along a well-traveled game path or road. As it digs, it exudes a tine oil that mixes with the soil to form a substance that has far less surface tension than water or normal quicksand. Those who have had the chance to examine a pool of wyndlass quicksand claim that it is so slippery that you cannot actually feel it when you run it between your fingers. Whether or not that is the case, it is impossible to swim in the substance as it offers almost no support at all. When a creature steps onto the pit, it instantly plunges beneath the surface and is attacked by the wyndlass.</div><div class='indent'>When a wyndlass feels that game is becoming scarce in a given area, it pulls itself out of its pit and begins the slow migration to a new home. As a rule, the wyndlass relocates like this only once a year or so.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> A powerful hunter in its own right, the wyndlass has few (if any) natural enemies. On occasion, it may be sought out and destroyed by teams of adventurers, however, because of the oil that it secretes. As a lubricant, wyndlass oil is second to none. While this alone might be enough to bring a few hunters out after the wyndlass, it is the creature’s use to alchemists and wizards that most often spawns a hunting party. Wyndlass oil is one of the most common, and important, ingredients in <i>oil of slipperiness</i>, and it is often sought for this purpose.</div>",

    "Description": "<div>The yaggol are a degenerate sub-race of the evil and terrifying mind flayers Degenerate, in this case, does not mean more debased or decadent (mind flayers are already decadent in the extreme). Rather, the yaggol have culturally regressed, and their once formidable mental powers have atrophied and are forgotten.</div><div class='indent'>In appearance, the yaggol are almost identical with their cousins. They are larger, standing about seven feet tall, and have greater physical power. They have the same uncanny resemblance to malevolent octopi, including the four long tentacles that hide their mouth. Their skin is chameleonlike, shifting in color and pattern to match the background. The possible color changes range from brilliant rich green to a scarlet orange, encompassing various shades of browns, greens, and yellows. They possess three fingers on each hand, weirdly jointed so that any one can oppose the other two. The older members of their community dress in flowing robes, while the youths often wear nothing more than simple loincloths.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> Although they have lost much of the intelligence of their ancestors, the yaggol are still incredibly dangerous and cunning in combat. They are extremely hard to spot if hidden against a natural background – one that falls within the color range of their powers. Elves have a 50% chance of noticing them, all others have a 20% chance. The yaggol must be within 30 feet before they can be spotted. If not detected, the yaggol automatically attack with surprise.</div><div class='indent'>Once in combat, a yaggol attacks with its fists, delivering powerful blows. In addition, it can attack with its long tentacles. As with the mind flayer, any tentacle that hits will worm its way to the victims brain in 1d4 rounds. It then sucks the brain out and eats it. Each round these attached tentacles cause an automatic 1d6 points of damage. Victims can tear free if they roll a successful Strength check, but doing so causes 1d10 points of damage per attached tentacle.</div><div class='indent'>The yaggol have lost nearly all the great mental powers of mind flayers. Thus they have no innate spell ability and possess only a simple mind blast. This affects those within a radius of ten feet around the creatures. All within the area must roll a successful saving throw vs. wand or suffer 3d6 points of damage from the intense mental agony the creatures radiate. Their own kind (including the more advanced illithids) are immune to this effect. The mind blast places a great strain on the creatures; they must wait an hour before attempting it again. Furthermore, it dazes them for the round immediately after. They can take no actions as they recover their wits.</div><div class='indent'>The yaggol are extremely savage and ferocious. At the same time, they are not so stupid as to fight against hopeless odds. They freely retreat from battles that go against them, even leaving their own kind behind. When they can, they take slaves (dinner for a later date). Failing this, they seek to kill as many as possible to provide a large quantity of fresh meat for the tribe.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> The yaggol are descended from the more powerful and numerous race of mind flayers, a stellar race from the dark, cold reaches of space. According to their legends, which are extremely garbled, the yaggol once inhabited the stars but are now confined to the earth after offending some powerful being. Much more likely is that they are the survivors of a failed colonization attempt on Taladas, a failure caused by the destruction of the Cataclysm. They speak yaggol and whatever the local tongue is – cha’asi on Taladas. Originally a race that loved only darkness, the yaggol have adapted to surface life, although they still favor the comforting gloom of the jungle. They do not venture beyond the humid warmth of the jungle.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> The yaggol have a lifespan of no more than 60 years, spending the first five in a tadpole state. During this time there is the distinct possibility of being eaten by their elders in times of famine. Birth rates are accordingly high to adjust for the low chances of survival to adulthood. As a race they are asexual and in conversation freely refer to themselves as both he and she, having no understanding of the difference in the two words.</div>",

Adapted to the harsh conditions of the high frozen mountams, their bodies are covered with white or gray fur. This is especially thick on the soles of their feet and even covers their palms. Their heads seem to be squashed between their shoulders. Their facial features are small and flat to prevent frostbite They have prominent fangs, but do not attack with these They are intelligent although extremely primitive.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Combat:</b> The saqualaminoi are not subtle or particularly clever fighters. They have never had to be, since their size and power has generally assured they are the biggest creatures in their habitat. Furthermore, although fearsome in appearance, they are actually rather peaceful. They only attack for food or in self-defense.</div><div class='indent'>In combat, they fight with their powerful fists, striking smashing blows capable of felling an ordinary man. A few have learned to make simple bone, wood, and stone clubs. These weapons cause 2d6+4 points of damage, but the creature can make only one attack per round.</div><div class='indent'>Being well adapted to snow and cold, saqualaminoi are immune to cold-based attacks, normal or magical (although they still suffer from falling pieces of ice, etc.). Furthermore, their broad feet and claws enable them to move across snow and ice with no movement penalties.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Habitat/Society:</b> The saqualaminoi live in the highest mountain ranges either just below or on the fringes of the great glaciers that fill these peaks. Here they make their homes in the ice caves crevasses that break the frozen wall. Their lives are simple, organized around small family units. Each bull takes a female and together they raise their young. Several families living in the same area form a community. This is nothing more than a loose assemblage of families that only occasionally bands together for the common good.</div><div class='indent'>The most common cooperative action is hunting. The creatures are carnivores, but are not particularly fierce. They prey mostly on the sheep, mountain goats, and marmots found at high altitudes. They do not attack other humanoids, but do fight in defense. They do not normally attack humanoids. Instead they tend to be very curious about creatures of similar appearance.</div><div class='indent'>In times of bad weather or poor food, the saqualaminoi are forced to raid outside their range. Since the fierce winter storms frequently drive away game, these raids most often occur during periods of foul weather. Thus the saqualaminoi have earned the reputation as monsters that come out of the snowstorms to raid and kill.</div><div class='indent'>The saqualaminoi are an intelligent people. They have a simple language of grunts and howls. They make very simple stone and wood tools. They do not have a written language or many highly developed concepts of good or evil, but they tend to be good by nature.</div><br/><div><b style='color:#4169E1'>Ecology:</b> The saqualaminoi are primitive predators. Their pelts are too coarse to be of value. The little treasure they collect comes from the minor baubles they find interesting.</div>",
